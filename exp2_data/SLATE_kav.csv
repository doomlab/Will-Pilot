SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/judge-brett-kavanaugh-should-be-impeached-for-lying-during-his-confirmation-hearings.html,"
          Much of Washington has spent the week focusing on whether Judge Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the Supreme Court. After the revelations of his confirmation hearings, the better question is whether he should be impeached from the federal judiciary.
        
          I do not raise that question lightly, but I am certain it must be raised.
        
          Newly released emails show that while he was working to move through President George W. Bush’s judicial nominees in the early 2000s, Kavanaugh received confidential memos, letters, and talking points of Democratic staffers stolen by GOP Senate aide Manuel Miranda. That includes research and talking points Miranda stole from the Senate server after I had written them for the Senate Judiciary Committee as the chief counsel for nominations for the minority.
        
          Receiving those memos and letters alone is not an impeachable offense.
        
          No, Kavanaugh should be removed because he was repeatedly asked under oath as part of his 2004 and 2006 confirmation hearings for his position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit about whether he had received such information from Miranda, and each time he falsely denied it.
        
          For example, in 2004, Sen. Orrin Hatch asked him directly if he received “any documents that appeared to you to have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.” Kavanaugh responded, unequivocally, “No.”
        
          In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy asked him if he had any regrets about how he treated documents he had received from Miranda that he later learned were stolen. Kavanaugh rejected the premise of the question, restating that he never even saw one of those documents.
        
          Back then the senators did not have the emails that they have now, showing that Miranda sent Kavanaugh numerous documents containing what was plainly research by Democrats. Some of those emails went so far as to warn Kavanaugh not to distribute the Democratic talking points he was being given. If these were documents shared from the Democratic side of the aisle as part of normal business, as Kavanaugh claimed to have believed in his most recent testimony, why would they be labeled “not [for] distribution”? And why would we share our precise strategy to fight controversial Republican nominations with the Republicans we were fighting? 
        
          Another email chain included the subject line “spying.” It’s hard to imagine a more definitive clue than that. Another said “Senator Leahy’s staff has distributed a confidential letter to Dem Counsel” and then described for Kavanaugh that precise confidential information we had gathered about a nominee Kavanaugh was boosting. Again, it is illogical to think that we would have just given Miranda this “confidential” information for him to use against us. But this is precisely what Judge Kavanaugh suggested in his testimony on Wednesday. He is not that naïve.
        
          In the hearing this week, Sen. Leahy also noted that the previously hidden emails showed that Miranda asked to meet Kavanaugh in person to give him “paper” files with “useful info to map out [Sens. Joe] Biden and [Dianne] Feinstein, and others.” The promised information included “Biden-speak.” Again, this would not have been a normal information exchange.
        
          In response to Leahy’s questions this week, Kavanaugh made the outlandish claim that it was typical for him to be told what Democrats planned to ask at these combative hearings over controversial nominees, and that this was in fact the “coin of the realm.” As a Democrat who worked on those questions, I can say definitively that it was not typical at all. Kavanaugh knows this full well.
        
          At the time, Kavanaugh was working with Miranda and outside groups to try to force these nominees through the Senate over Democratic objections, and it would have been suicide to give them our research, talking points, strategies, or confidential letters. The GOP senators, their staff, the White House, and outside groups were working intensively to undermine the work of Democratic senators to block the most extreme of President Bush’s judicial nominees.
        
          The Leahy talking points given to Kavanaugh were from my in-depth research into why the Senate had compelling historical precedent for examining Miguel Estrada’s Department of Justice records, which the White House counsel’s office was refusing to surrender. Other confidential materials Miranda shared with Kavanaugh related to investigations Democrats were pursuing over how Judge Priscilla Owen had handled an abortion case involving parental consent and about the overlap between her funders and groups with business before the courts of Texas. We would never have provided that information—key to our strategy to try to block what we considered extremist judicial nominations—to Miranda or to the White House.
        
          During his testimony, Kavanaugh conflated these adversarial proceedings with ones in which Democrats might have cooperated with the other side, like the Patriot Act and airline liability. But these weren’t hearings on some bill where senators would share their concerns across the aisle to try to get a bipartisan fix on problems in a piece of legislation. These were oppositional proceedings in committee and on the floor over controversial judicial nominees. Kavanaugh knew this just as intimately as I did—our sides fought over those nominations intensely.
        
          It was also an area where Kavanaugh’s judicial nominations alliance had taken a scorched-earth approach, attacking Democrats ruthlessly. The White House’s closest allies went so far as to call Leahy and other Democrats on the committee “anti-Catholic,” even running attack ads.
        
          Perhaps Kavanaugh was so blinded by his quest to get the most controversial Bush nominees confirmed in 2003 that he did not have any concerns about the bounty of secret memos and letters he was receiving—the full extent of which is not known because so many documents are still secret.
        
          But, surely, reasonable questions about what he had been party to would have been considered after the story of the theft exploded in the news, Miranda was forced to resign, and the U.S. Senate sergeant-at-arms began a bipartisan investigation into the files stolen from the Senate?
        
          As of November 2003, when the sergeant-at-arms seized the Judiciary Committee’s servers, Kavanaugh would have been on notice that any of the letters, talking points, or research described as being from Democrats that were provided to him by Miranda were suspect and probably stolen from the Senate’s server.
        
          But he did nothing. He did not come forward to the Senate to provide information about the confidential documents Miranda had given him, which were clearly from the Democrats.
        
          Kavanaugh also apparently did nothing when the Senate referred the case to the U.S. attorney’s office for criminal prosecution. (Miranda was never prosecuted.)
        
          Eventually, though, Kavanaugh went even further to help cover up the details of the theft.
        
          During the hearings on his nomination to the D.C. Circuit a few months after the Miranda news broke, Kavanaugh actively hid his own involvement, lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee by stating unequivocally that he not only knew nothing of the episode, but also never even received any stolen material.
        
          Even if Kavanaugh could claim that he didn’t have any hint at the time he received the emails that these documents were of suspect provenance—which I personally find implausible—there is no reasonable way for him to assert honestly that he had no idea what they were after the revelation of the theft. Any reasonable person would have realized they had been stolen, and certainly someone as smart as Kavanaugh would have too.
        
          But he lied.
        
          Under oath.
        
          And he did so repeatedly.
        
          Significantly, he did so even though a few years earlier he had helped spearhead the impeachment of President Bill Clinton for perjury in a private civil case. Back then Kavanaugh took lying under oath so seriously that he was determined to do everything he could to help remove a president from office.
        
          Now we know that he procured his own confirmation to the federal bench by committing the same offense. And he did so not in a private case but in the midst of public hearings for a position of trust, for a lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary.
        
          His actions were dishonorable and dishonest.
        
          This week, as part of his efforts to be elevated to the highest court in the land, he has calmly continued to deceive, falsely claiming that it would have been perfectly normal for him to receive secret Democratic letters, talking points, and other materials. And if this absurd notion were somehow true, it would not even be consistent with what he testified to 12 and 14 years ago. Back then, he didn’t state it would have been normal for him to receive secret Democratic strategy materials.
        
          Instead, he explicitly and repeatedly went out of his way to say he never had access to any such materials. These objectively false statements were offered under oath to convince the committee of something that was untrue. It was clearly intentional, with Kavanaugh going so far as to correct Sen. Kennedy when the senator described the document situation accurately.
        
          That’s why—without even getting into other reasonable objections to his nomination—he should not be confirmed.
        
          In fact, by his own standard, he should clearly be impeached.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-patrick-leahy-points-to-email-that-suggests-judge-lied-to-senate.html,"
          In Wednesday’s first round of questioning during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Patrick Leahy made a significant allegation against the Supreme Court nominee. The Democrat from Vermont claimed to have evidence showing that Kavanaugh lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 2004 and 2006 hearings regarding his nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
        
          The key testimony came when Leahy questioned Kavanaugh about previous testimony in which he denied that he had any knowledge of confidential electronic communications that had been pilfered from Democratic senators by Republican staffer Manuel Miranda and used to help advance President George W. Bush’s judicial nominations in the early 2000s. Kavanaugh, who worked for the Bush administration as part of the White House counsel’s office, worked with Miranda on matters relating to those judicial nominations.
        
          As Leahy put it to Kavanaugh, the judge had been asked in prior hearings “extensively about your knowledge of this theft” and “testified repeatedly that you had never received any stolen materials.” (The GOP staffer was never charged with a crime; more on that later.) Indeed, in the April 2004 hearing, when asked directly by Sen. Orrin Hatch if he had so much as seen any documents that Miranda had taken, Kavanaugh answered in unequivocal terms.
        
          In that hearing 14 years ago, Sen. Chuck Schumer reiterated the concern and got the same answer:
        
          In his 2006 hearing, Kavanaugh was asked by Sen. Ted Kennedy whether he had any indication that materials he had seen might have been stolen. Kavanaugh rejected the premise of the question, again stating that he’d never laid eyes on such materials:
        
          On Wednesday, Leahy pointed to newly released emails that he says contradict Kavanaugh’s previous testimony. Leahy began by asking, “Did Mr. Miranda ever provide you with highly specific information regarding what I or other Democratic senators were planning in the future to ask certain judicial nominees?” This time, though, Kavanaugh hedged, refusing to directly answer a question that would seem to elicit a simple “no” based on his previous testimony. Instead, he offered that it was typical in his role in the White House counsel’s office to meet and discuss what senators on both sides of the aisle were thinking about asking a given nominee:
        
          Leahy then pointed the Supreme Court nominee to an email Kavanaugh had received from Miranda describing Leahy’s line of questioning about a nominee on July 19, 2002, four days before a hearing with that nominee.
        
          Again, Kavanaugh argued it was not uncommon to discuss the individual interests of particular senators. Leahy then followed up with what appeared to be smoking gun evidence that Kavanaugh was being untruthful when he repeatedly testified that he had never seen the materials Miranda had stolen.
        
          In his previous testimony, Kavanaugh didn’t say that he didn’t realize that some of the materials he had received were stolen. Instead, he stated definitively that he had received no stolen materials. He went further, in fact, stating to Hatch that he had never seen “any documents that appeared […] to have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.” On Wednesday, Kavanaugh acknowledged receiving an email with exactly that material.
        
          In 2004, the Senate sergeant-at-arms released a 65-page report laying out how Miranda and another Republican aide improperly accessed and distributed 4,670 files showing Democrats’ private tactics in opposing Bush’s judicial nominations. The New York Times reported at the time that the information in question was “about how Democrats would question some nominees” and included the files of staff aides for Sens. Leahy, Kennedy, Dick Durbin, Joe Biden, Dianne Feinstein, and Russ Feingold. The files were taken after “an inexperienced computer coordinator did not make files properly inaccessible,” according to the Times. Neither Miranda nor anyone else was ever charged with a crime for accessing those private Democratic files.
        
          On Wednesday, Leahy hinted that materials that haven’t been made public indicate Kavanaugh was given very strong hints that Miranda’s materials were not acquired legitimately. The Vermont senator asked Kavanaugh about documents that have been listed as “committee confidential” by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley that, according to Leahy, demonstrate that Kavanaugh was told of “a mole that provided … secret information related to nominations.”
        
          Kavanaugh indicated he couldn’t recall such an email, and this time Leahy was unable to pull out the receipt because of that committee confidential designation.
        
          “I am concerned because there is evidence that Mr. Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me. And that would contradict your prior testimony,” Leahy concluded. “It is also clear from public emails—and I’m restraining from going into not public ones—that you have reason to believe materials were obtained inappropriately at the time.”
        
          Leahy then said he had six other “committee confidential” emails that would prove his case, but they were being kept from the public without any rational basis.
        
          “These other six contain no personal information, no presidential records, restricted material,” he said. “There is simply no reason they can’t be made public.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-hearing-yale-legacy.html,"
          After hours of testimony Thursday during which Brett Kavanaugh answered—and dodged—questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee, observers noted that the Supreme Court nominee had, on multiple occasions, lied under oath.
        
          The lies ranged from outright falsehoods to misleading assertions (he claimed he the matter had been investigated, when in reality alleged witnesses just issued short statements; and he claimed the alleged witnesses said the party didn’t happen, when in reality they said they couldn’t remember it) and dubious statements (he claimed he never had gaps in his memory, while others attested to his heavy drinking).
        
          Some of the more blatantly false statements were far less important, but false nonetheless. He claimed, for example, that the drinking age at Maryland at the time was 18, when in reality by the time he was 18, the drinking age was 21. On Saturday, the Intercept identified yet another minor, but still clear-cut, falsehood.
        
          At one point in the testimony, when Kavanaugh was making the point that he had worked hard and earned his success, Kavanaugh told the committee that he had no connections to Yale before attending. “I have no connections there,” he said. “I got there by busting my tail.”
        
          In reality, Kavanaugh was a legacy student. His grandfather, Everett Edward Kavanaugh, attended Yale as an undergraduate. The Intercept published a photo of a 1928 yearbook as evidence:
        
          The legacy status does not necessarily mean that Kavanaugh would not have been accepted otherwise or that he was allowed in unfairly. But it does mean that in explicitly saying he had “no connections,” he was not telling the truth.
        
          These kinds of small falsehoods will likely not matter to the Senate, as the newly launched and highly limited FBI background investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh will not investigate his drinking or any possible perjury related to the way he described it in his testimony.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-kozinski-gag-list-emails-senate-hearings.html,"
          When I came forward in December about my experience in Judge Alex Kozinski’s chambers, I said that when he showed me pictures of naked people without my co-clerks present, I felt isolated. Had they been there, I explained, “it would have felt like I was being treated as one of the guys. Kozinski was not known for being terribly appropriate, but I could handle that. Inappropriateness directed solely at me felt very different than chambers-wide jokes.”
        
          Those chamberswide jokes that I alluded to have now become an issue in Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski in the early 1990s and has maintained a close personal relationship with the judge. When Kavanaugh was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006, it was Kozinski who introduced him to the Senate.
        
          For years, Kozinski maintained an email list known as the “Easy Rider Gag List,” to which he would send sexually explicit and otherwise raunchy jokes; the existence of the list was first publicized in 2008. In his hearings, Kavanaugh was asked by Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mazie Hirono if he was aware of the email list, and if he had received emails from Kozinski with sexually explicit content. In response to these questions, he said he couldn’t recall anything like that. And, in response to a written question for the record—“Has Judge Kozinski ever made comments about sexual matters to you, either in jest or otherwise?”—Kavanaugh responded, “I do not remember any such comments.”
        
          This last response leaves me wondering whether Kavanaugh and I clerked for the same man. Kozinski’s sexual comments—to both men and women—were legendary. When I first arrived in chambers, the outgoing clerks suggested that we should watch The Aristocrats, a documentary about a notorious dirty joke, to prepare ourselves for the upcoming year. Kozinski’s email list had hundreds of participants, and some of the jokes he shared were incredibly off-color. Kozinski has repeatedly said in interviews that he learned to write from reading Playboy (see this NPR interview from 2004, one of multiple public venues where he has mentioned this.) And in his statement announcing his retirement, which he released after 15 women had come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him, he said that he “had a broad sense of humor and a candid way of speaking to both male and female law clerks alike.”
        
          Kavanaugh’s relationship with Kozinski started as a judge-clerk relationship—a relationship that Kozinski describes as “the most intense and mutually dependent one outside of marriage, parenthood, or a love affair.” In that same article, which Kavanaugh has approvingly referenced, Kozinski states that “[j]udge and law clerk are tethered by an invisible cord for the rest of their mutual careers.” Over the years, that invisible cord has been short for Kozinski and Kavanaugh. They have sat on panels together and co-authored books. (In the hearings, Hatch asked Kavanaugh questions about how frequently the two men spoke, and Kavanaugh answered “not often,” and went on to note that Kozinski worked in Pasadena, California, while Kavanaugh currently works in D.C.)
        
          I did not have as strong a relationship with Kozinski. But having clerked in his chambers, I do not know how it would be possible to forget something as pervasive as Kozinski’s famously sexual sense of humor or his gag list, as Kavanaugh has professed to in his hearings. Kozinski regularly regaled his clerks with jokes from his gag list, and many list members were former clerks. During my clerkship, he forwarded me four gag list emails as teasers for what I could expect if I joined. (He also sent me one email after I left.) Some of the jokes he forwarded were innocuous; others were disturbing.
        
          People on the gag list were identified by “handles.” Before I left chambers, Kozinski informed me of the handles chosen by those of my co-clerks who had joined the list and told me I needed to come up with my own. After the end of my clerkship, in an email exchange with Kozinski in which I told him to put me on the list, his emailed response was “You need a handle.” (For the record, I half-heartedly came up with a handle a few weeks later, and when he didn’t add me to the list, I sighed in relief and didn’t push the matter.)
        
          Here is what I know about the Easy Rider Gag List, based on the emails that were forwarded to me by Kozinski. It has been around since at least 1995, the vintage of the oldest email that he forwarded to me during my clerkship, and it was run from the email address kozinski@mizar.usc.edu. The practice of identifying people by their self-chosen handles appears to have started sometime between 1995 and 1997.
        
          Here’s one of the forwarded emails I received. As you can see, some of the jokes aren’t that bad:
        
          Other jokes were both sexist and sexual, like this 1997-era quiz, which I will excerpt (you can read the full email here, and another example here):
        
          Others were utterly disgusting. The reporter who broke the story of the gag list for the Los Angeles Times in 2008 must have had this email, as it’s described in relatively mild terms. I do not think the story conveys exactly how repugnant this email is. (You can read it in full here.)
        
          The premise of the email is that a man is writing to his wife, Tina, who has recently left him, to tell her how much he misses her. It starts like this:
        
          It goes on to describe several explicit sexual encounters the man has had with other women, like this one:
        
          Part of the joke is that the man doesn’t remember the name of the wife who he supposedly can’t forget:
        
          It ends with a graphic description of an encounter the man has with his ex-wife’s kid sister:
        
          Alex Kozinski forwarded these emails to me while I was clerking for him—and they were so in line with the pervasive chamberswide environment that, when I wrote an account of the sexual harassment I experienced that year, I chose not to mention them beyond a single reference to “inappropriate” chamberswide jokes. Kozinski exposed us to this sort of material almost every day of the clerkship. The only way that Kavanaugh could not recall any comments about sexual matters would be if he had amnesia about the clerkship in its entirety.
        
          I am less certain that he would have had to know about the gag list, but only slightly so. Kozinski pressured me to join; it’s hard to imagine that he wouldn’t have approached Kavanaugh. It wasn’t required that former clerks would join his gag list, but there was intense pressure to remain in the good graces of a boss who would still be needed for recommendations. Clerks were also asked to join at the end of a year in which we were repeatedly exposed to humor like what I have shared here, which desensitized us to typical norms of decency. Most importantly, unlike Kozinski’s harassment, those who participated in his gag list did so consensually. I would never condemn any of Kozinski’s former clerks on the basis of joining. (I strongly suspect some joined and just trashed the messages.)
        
          But when asked directly and under oath whether he was on this list or whether he received any inappropriate emails from his former mentor, Kavanaugh has said that he can’t remember. Here are his written answers to even more specific questions on the matter, posed by Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware:
        
          It really is a shame that, while being reviewed for a seat on the highest court in the land, and while framing himself as a champion of women, Kavanaugh could not find the time to search his emails to answer this question more precisely.
        
          But since Kavanaugh won’t go looking for the answer, we can help him out.
        
          After hearing senators question Kavanaugh about the gag list, I went back through the emails I received from Alex Kozinski. Those messages reveal that, for those correspondents who were on his gag list, Kozinski labeled them in his address book by their handles instead of their names—something I had noticed for those clerks whose handles he had disclosed to me.
        
          But there’s a little quirk at play with his mailing program. Up until at least 2008, the handles he set for them would show up in place of their names on any emails Kozinski sent out—not just the ones he sent to the gag list.
        
          Here is an email I was cc’d on after leaving my clerkship, along with other former clerks. I have blacked out email addresses and real names for privacy reasons; I have also edited handles (in blue) whose nature would easily identify the person in question. As you can see from the “to” list, some of the people just show up as email addresses in the address book, or, in one case, as the person’s real name. Others show up under their handles, e.g. “The Big Ukrainian,” “Tank,” and “Headboy.” Those, presumably, are the people who were on Kozinski’s gag list.
        
          There’s an easy way, then, to figure out whether Kavanaugh was on Kozinski’s Easy Rider Gag List. All we need is an email sent before 2008 from one of Kozinski’s personal accounts—either kozinski@usc.edu (which is listed in this Wall Street Journal op-ed) or alex@kozinski.com (which is listed in this blog post)—that went to Kavanaugh’s personal (not his court) email account. The header on that email will tell us what name Kozinski uses for Kavanaugh in his personal address book.
        
          If there is no handle, or if Kavanaugh is listed under his real name, he probably wasn’t on the gag list. But if he has a handle, there’s a strong probability that Kavanaugh also received emails like the ones I’ve excerpted here.
        
          Who could provide such an email? Given Kozinski’s prolific emailing habits, there are probably dozens of people who received messages from the judge in which Kavanaugh was cc’d.
        
          Does it matter if Kavanaugh received these emails? Personally, I don’t think that the receipt of those emails should be disqualifying. Likewise, I don’t think it would be inherently disqualifying if Kavanaugh heard Kozinski speak about sexual matters.
        
          This country is in desperate need of honest conversations about how sexual harassment thrives. I am more willing to support someone who has thoughtfully considered his past than someone who is unable, even in hindsight, to recognize ways in which he could have been a better ally to women.
        
          What I find disturbing is that when faced with a few simple questions, Kavanaugh decided that evasion was a better path than introspection. We should demand more from a nominee to the Supreme Court.

          In 1983, I was one of Brett Kavanaugh’s freshman roommates at Yale University. About two weeks ago I came forward to lend my support to my friend Deborah Ramirez, who says Brett sexually assaulted her at a party in a dorm suite. I did this because I believe Debbie.
        
          Now the FBI is investigating this incident. I am willing to speak with them about my experiences at Yale with both Debbie and Brett. I would tell them this: Brett Kavanaugh stood up under oath and lied about his drinking and about the meaning of words in his yearbook. He did so baldly, without hesitation or reservation. In his words and his behavior, Judge Kavanaugh has shown contempt for the truth, for the process, for the rule of law, and for accountability. His willingness to lie to avoid embarrassment throws doubt on his denials about the larger questions of sexual assault. In contrast, I cannot remember ever having a reason to distrust anything, large or small, that I have heard from Debbie.
        
          I did not want to come forward. When the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow contacted me while researching a story about Debbie and Brett, I told him that I didn’t see the point. There is no way that Brett will face legal consequences after this much time. Either he will be confirmed or another conservative judge will be. There would be a high cost. I was raised in a Republican family. My mother, who has since passed away, was a Republican state representative in Connecticut. My father owns a MAGA hat. I have close friends who are very conservative. In recent years I have had disagreements over politics with some of these friends and family, but I care deeply about them. My involvement has and will come with personal, professional, and reputational damage.
        
          Ultimately, I told Farrow that Debbie’s story was believable and that Brett was “frequently, incoherently drunk.” When asked about my comments in the New Yorker at his hearing last week, Judge Kavanaugh seemed to suggest that my account was not credible because “it was a contentious situation” where I “did not like” the third suitemate. He then referenced a prank I pulled on the third suitemate and some redacted portion of his closed-door questioning by Senate Judiciary Committee staff. It’s true that I played a prank on the third roommate. We were not close. But that relationship has no bearing on my ability to observe Kavanaugh’s behavior then and to describe it now.
        
          As for the specifics of what happened to Debbie freshman year: When Farrow approached me, I had a vague memory of an event involving Debbie and Brett, but not enough to say “I am sure.” I told Farrow that I could participate off the record and only to support Debbie’s credibility and to describe Brett’s behavior when drinking, where I had meaningful, firsthand experience.
        
          Right before publication, Farrow called me and asked if I would reconsider publicly sharing my own recollections. Debbie was going to be attacked. She had lived with the pain of this event for years. Brett’s friends who participated would deny that it happened. It would be a powerful Washington judge and his friends against Debbie.
        
          Others would say: “Brett was background-checked many times. This must be made up.” As Brett’s college freshman roommate, I would have expected to be interviewed if a background check was looking for evidence of poor college behavior. I wasn’t called. I assume college behavior was not a topic of interest. The FBI didn’t find Debbie’s story because they were not looking for it.
        
          As for this round of the investigation: I still haven’t been called, even though they are supposedly looking into Debbie’s case. How will they learn what happened if once again they are not allowed to truly and thoroughly investigate?
        
          Debbie needed someone to help her be heard. When nobody else would do it, I agreed to be quoted in Farrow’s story on the record. “Is it believable that she was alone with a wolfy group of guys who thought it was funny to sexually torment a girl like Debbie? Yeah, definitely,” I said. “Is it believable that Kavanaugh was one of them? Yes.” I stand by this quote and I accept it is my opinion and not objective fact.
        
          Since the New Yorker story came out, I have been asked for countless interviews by print publications, TV, and online media, the vast majority of which I have resisted. Ultimately I wrote and distributed a statement to minimize the distraction to my personal and business life. In the statement, I wrote that Brett “was a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk.” 
        
          I believe that many women have been mistreated and silenced. When they come forward, they are treated like they are liars or whiners or crazy. But I also believe that both accusers and the accused deserve a deep, unfettered investigation. In Brett’s cases, if he is innocent, he should be cleared. If he is not and he is being untruthful to the nation, that should disqualify him from sitting on the highest court in the land. This just seems fair.
        
          The other night I reviewed the transcript of the hearings. People are asking for me to respond.
        
          I do not know if Brett attacked Christine Blasey Ford in high school or if he sexually humiliated Debbie in front of a group of people she thought were her friends. But I can say that he lied under oath. He claimed that he occasionally drank too much but never enough to forget details of the night before, never enough to “black out.” He did, regularly. He said that “boofing” was farting and the “Devil’s Triangle” was a drinking game. “Boofing” and “Devil’s Triangle” are sexual references. I know this because I heard Brett and his friends using these terms on multiple occasions.
        
          I can’t imagine that anyone in the Senate wants to confirm an individual to a lifetime appointment on the United States Supreme Court who has demonstrated a willingness to be untruthful under oath about easily verified information.
        
          I do not argue that Brett or anyone else should be persecuted for teenage drinking antics that are common to many, many Americans. My parents once visited Yale unexpectedly to find that I was unresponsive in my dorm room after a long session at Mory’s where friends and I sang and drank from trophy cups way past our limits. I was not a choirboy, but—unlike Brett—I’m not going on national television and testifying under oath that I was. This is not about drinking too much or even encouraging others to drink. It is not about using coarse language or even about the gray area between testing sexual boundaries with a date and sexual abuse. This is about denial. This is about not facing consequences. This is about lying.
        
          In this case, the lies are not trivial: His lies about sexual terms and his drinking are directly relevant to the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford and Debbie Ramirez, which both involved sexual behavior and heavy drinking. The truth would make him look bad and would bolster the credibility of both of these women. In this climate, had he simply said “I don’t remember” or even “If I did these things in my youth I am sorry,” he might have sailed through the confirmation process. But he lied, under oath, like it was nothing.
        
          During last week’s hearings, some committee members equated Brett’s frustration over his stalled ambitions and the challenges to his character to Ford’s pain from an attempted rape and challenges to hers. They had both “been through a lot.” Members of the committee ignored the obvious and easily checked inaccuracies in his story and instead chose to erupt with rage that one of the most powerful men in America might have to defend himself against credible allegations of sexual assault. There was no consideration given to the truth that even if he withdraws, Brett will return to his position for life as one of the most powerful forces in the U.S. justice system. The women who say that they have been traumatized by his actions, meanwhile, will know that their suffering and bravery did not even warrant a thorough investigation.
        
          Debbie’s story and her pain have been lost in all of the yelling. Her accusation should be fully and properly investigated, as should any current and emerging allegations regarding Judge Kavanaugh’s behavior. Let real law enforcement professionals spend the time that it takes to figure out the truth. If this takes too long, find a less controversial, similarly conservative judge and start over.
        
          To me it seems very simple. We are deciding if a man is suited to judge others. To hear with compassion and empathy the cases of the vulnerable. As a Supreme Court justice, he would be the last line of legal defense for people who need a champion with unimpeachable judgment. A man who lies effortlessly rather than taking responsibility for his own words and actions is not what we need.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-lies-senate-testimony-supreme-court.html,"
          Last week, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of repeatedly misleading the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings. “Brett Kavanaugh used materials stolen from Democratic senators to advance President Bush’s judicial nominees,” the committee’s ranking member tweeted. “He was asked about this in 2004, 2006 and this week. His answers were not true.”
        
          Citing an essay in Slate by Lisa Graves, a former staffer for Sen. Patrick Leahy, Feinstein presented a line of argument that’s gaining currency among Democratic senators: that Kavanaugh’s lack of honesty makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court. In this case, Kavanaugh has repeatedly sworn that he never received documents stolen by Republican Senate aide Manny Miranda—documents that he did, in fact, receive.
        
          For the most part, Senate Republicans have ignored this line of attack. Since they seem to have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh, there is apparently little reason for them to respond to any criticism of the nominee. One exception is Sen. Orrin Hatch, who called the allegations that Kavanaugh lied a “desperate“ attempt to torpedo his nomination. The Utah Republican cited an editorial by National Review, which described the charges against Kavanaugh as a Democratic “smear” campaign. The arguments regarding the stolen documents in that editorial, though, are flimsy at best.
        
          National Review describes the key portions of Kavanaugh’s testimony correctly:
        
          From there, National Review’s case quickly falls apart.
        
          “At the same time, however, Kavanaugh was careful to say that he might have unknowingly seen information ‘derived’ from the memos,” the editorial continues. “So, to be clear, to demonstrate perjury the Democrats would have to show clearly and unequivocally that Kavanaugh didn’t just see information taken from the memos but that he clearly and knowingly viewed the actual memos themselves.” The essay then asserts, “There is not a single email or document showing that he actually received a stolen memo, much less that he did so knowingly.”
        
          National Review both misstates the standard for demonstrating that Kavanaugh lied and misstates the facts of the case. First, Kavanaugh said that he never received any memos or any documents that appeared to him to be prepared by Democrats. He repeated this throughout his testimony in 2004 and 2006. He didn’t say, “I didn’t knowingly receive memos or stolen documents.” He didn’t say, “I may have received memos or stolen documents but only realized this after the fact.” Rather, he flatly denied this possibility.
        
          Kavanaugh said to Hatch in 2004 that he didn’t receive “documents that appeared to [me] to have been drafted or prepared by Democratic staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.” He said to Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2004 that “Mr. Miranda never provided these documents” and that he had never “come across memos from internal files of any Democratic members.” And Kavanaugh said to Kennedy in 2006, “I do know that I never received any memos.”
        
          The bar for a lie here is to demonstrate that Kavanaugh had received any memos from Democratic staff or documents from Miranda that appeared drafted or prepared by Democratic judiciary staffers. By the plainest meaning of those words, Kavanaugh received both things.
        
          Documents released last week reveal that in early 2003, Miranda sent Kavanaugh an email with the subject line “Judiciary Dems obstruct on reorganization.” That email contained a draft letter from Democratic Judiciary Committee members to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle laying out their desired negotiating position over a new process for judicial confirmations. Miranda indicated to Kavanaugh that the document was not public at the time he sent it, saying, “I am told that all [Democrats] on the [Judiciary Committee]” were signing on to the document.
        
          Another email released last week included a bullet-pointed memo written by Graves for Democratic staff. The memo contains a laundry list of research Graves put together for Judiciary Committee staff laying out legal arguments Democrats planned to make regarding a controversial Bush judicial nominee. As Graves noted in her Slate piece, it would have made no logical sense for Democrats to surrender their legal research in these highly combative proceedings. But you don’t have to take her at her word that the material clearly came from Democratic staff and was clearly confidential. Miranda’s email to Kavanaugh describes this memo as “confidential information” from “Dem staffers.”
        
          In its editorial, National Review cites legal scholar and Above the Law founder David Lat to bolster its pro-Kavanaugh argument. On Twitter, Lat made a legalistic, Clintonian argument about what the meaning of the word memo is.
        
          Given that Kavanaugh, who worked for Kenneth Starr’s independent counsel’s Office, accused Bill Clinton of perjury because he “parse[d] the meaning of the words ‘is’ and ‘sex’ and on and on,” this would not seem to be an ideal defense.
        
          Graves, who wrote the stolen memo, noted that there were many ways for Kavanaugh to know he had verbatim content including the common sense that Democrats would never have revealed this confidential information to political rivals and the fact Miranda said the email included “confidential information” from “Dem Staffers.” But even if Kavanaugh didn’t suspect at the time that this was a stolen memo, it should have been obvious after Miranda’s theft became a major news story. And yet he insisted under oath that nothing that Miranda stole ever crossed his desk.
        
          Other former staffers whose material was stolen argue it’s absurd to contend that Kavanaugh would not have known that this detailed information wasn’t ripped off directly from the Democrats themselves. “These were the most contentious, contested things that came before the judiciary committee,” Seth Bloom, the nominations counsel for Sen. Herb Kohl at the time of the episode, said during a conference call with reporters on Monday. “I think Judge Kavanaugh’s description of how common that was [to receive this information] is completely untrue.”
        
          “Judicial nominations were not something that was a bipartisan effort,” Bob Schiff, former chief counsel for Sen. Russ Feingold, added. “To hear Judge Kavanaugh testify recently that this was kind of common for there to be information shared across the aisle as his way of explaining why key Democratic arguments and plans [were not suspicious to him] does not ring true.”
        
          If the documents that have been released in recent weeks had come to light in 2006, they could have easily torpedoed Kavanaugh’s nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Even without those documents, which clearly demonstrate that Kavanaugh has misled the Senate, his appointment was incredibly controversial. The vote fell just four short of the margin needed for a filibuster, with seven senators abstaining. “Mr. Kavanaugh is a political operative,” said Kennedy at the time. “I can say with confidence that Mr. Kavanaugh would be the youngest, least experienced and most partisan appointee to the court in decades.”
        
          Kristine Lucius, who worked for Leahy on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2002 through 2017, argued that these revelations would have stopped Kavanaugh’s judicial career cold. “I sincerely believe that if this information had been out at the time of his lower court confirmation hearing, he would not have been confirmed,” she argued. Lucius noted that Kavanaugh’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit occurred just after a sergeant-at-arms report was released detailing Miranda’s theft, when feelings on the subject were “still quite raw.”
        
          Indeed, even Hatch himself at the time equated Miranda’s behavior to stealing documents from a Senate office. “None of us would walk into another person’s office and take papers from their desk, and this is, in a sense, exactly that,” Hatch said after the revelation. “I am mortified that this improper, unethical and simply unacceptable breach of confidential files occurred,” the Republican from Utah added. “There is no excuse to justify these improper actions.”
        
          Kavanaugh has been given chance after chance after chance to tell the truth about what Miranda gave him, and he has continually declined to do so.
        
          “Kavanaugh basically used these stolen documents during his time in the White House Counsel’s office and he repeatedly misled the committee,” Lucius said. “He didn’t just mislead the Judiciary Committee last week, he misled the Judiciary Committee in 2004 and 2006 when he was asked about this very dark chapter, and he did so, I believe, for personal and partisan gain.”
        
          There is no indication that Kavanaugh will face any consequences for misleading the committee. Instead, he’ll get rewarded with a seat on the Supreme Court.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-alcohol-assault-allegations.html,"
          On Tuesday, President Trump dismissed the latest sexual misconduct accusation against his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Trump scoffed that Deborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh exposed his genitals to her during a drinking game in college, was too “inebriated” and “messed up” to know what happened. It’s reasonable to ask whether alcohol impaired Ramirez’s memory or the memory of Kavanaugh’s other accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. But it’s just as reasonable—and based on current evidence, more warranted—to raise that question about Kavanaugh himself.
        
          Broadly speaking, in the debate over Kavanaugh’s guilt or innocence, there are four possible answers. One is that Kavanaugh is lying. The second is that his accusers are lying. The third is that nobody’s lying: The accusers believe Kavanaugh did what they allege, but he didn’t. The fourth scenario, too, posits that nobody’s lying. On this theory, Kavanaugh believes he didn’t do what his accusers allege, but he did.
        
          The fourth option is worth a closer look. Ford says Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her down at a teen party, groped her, and tried to pull off her clothes. Ramirez says Kavanaugh stood next to her and dropped his pants when they were drinking with classmates at Yale. Is it possible that Kavanaugh did these things, even if he doesn’t remember them? Is there evidence that makes that scenario particularly plausible in his case? Are there steps that the Senate can and should take to investigate that possibility? The answer to all three questions is yes.
        
          Let’s start with the culture of drinking and partying among Kavanaugh’s high school friends. Numerous peers and classmates have described a routine of “fake IDs,” “unchaperoned parties,” “binge drinking,” “flocking to the house of whoever’s parents were out of town to drink six-packs,” and “Georgetown Prep students engaging in sexual misconduct.” One of Kavanaugh’s teachers says, “The drinking was unbelievable.” A classmate of Ford says, “The boys were pretty brutal. They would do what they could to get you drunk, and do whatever they would try to do to you.” Other students have reported the same.
        
          There was also a culture of booze among Kavanaugh’s college friends. Classmates say “heavy drinking was routine,” and “alcohol-fuelled parties” often led to gross sexual behavior. Kavanaugh’s fraternity loved to party and is remembered for “reviving a beer-drinking competition that college officials had banned from campus.” A photo taken during his frat years shows pledges marching with a flag made of bras and women’s underwear.
        
          Kavanaugh was part of this culture. His friend Mark Judge, who is accused of collaborating in the alleged assault on Ford, has written books and articles that detail extensive drinking in their social circle. In his writings, Judge calls this group “Alcoholics Unanimous.” He describes their school, Georgetown Prep, as “swimming in alcohol.” He depicts house parties like the one at which Ford says she was assaulted. According to Judge, these were informal, unsupervised gatherings at which boys and girls from single-sex schools could party together whenever “someone’s parents were going away.” For boys, the goal was sex. Judge writes: “Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up with someone.”
        
          Judge specifically describes incidents in which he “blacked out” and later learned that he had done things he didn’t recall. In one case, he woke up “terrified of what I could have done during the blackout.” He frets, “I could have done anything and not know it—I could have murdered somebody.” In another case, a friend informed him that during an episode of which Judge had no memory, Judge had “tried to make it with one of the bridesmaids.” Judge pleaded with his friend: “Please tell me I didn’t hurt her.” Judge’s ex-girlfriend says he once told her how he and other boys used a drunk woman for sex. Judge denies that he did this. But in one of his books, he confesses that when he drank, “It was as though there was a different version of myself—Mr. Hyde—who had taken over my body, and I couldn’t stop him.”
        
          Judge’s confessions about what he did while drunk—or believed he was capable of doing while drunk—are consistent with Ford’s account of what Judge and Kavanaugh did to her. Judge says he doesn’t remember any of it. Of course he doesn’t. That’s his pattern. When he drinks, he behaves aggressively and doesn’t recall what happened. According to Ford, Judge and Kavanaugh drank heavily before the assault. So there’s a prima facie case that Judge could have done what Ford alleges. But what about Kavanaugh?
        
          Kavanaugh’s entry in his high school yearbook makes clear that he drank. It’s facetious, but only in tone. He noted his membership in the “Beach Week Ralph Club” and called himself the treasurer of the “Keg City Club.” He also claimed to belong to the “Rehobeth Police Fan Club”—apparently a reference to a beach community where rowdy boys from Georgetown Prep got into trouble. Judge has described these beach trips as a “bacchanalia of drinking and sex, or at least attempts at sex.”
        
          As a freshman at Yale—the year after Ford says Kavanaugh assaulted her—Kavanaugh drank heavily, according to his roommate. “I would see him as he returned from nights out with his friends,” says the former roommate, James Roche. He recalls Kavanaugh as “a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time.” Roche describes Kavanaugh “frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk.”
        
          Kavanaugh has also admitted to heavy drinking at his next stop, Yale Law School. In a speech four years ago, he recalled organizing “a night of Boston bar-hopping,” with students “doing group chugs from a keg” and “falling out of the bus.” Kavanaugh went on to describe a night on which “we had more than a few beers,” then “we had a few drinks” at a banquet, then a friend “lost his balance and fell into the table,” breaking it, and a professor “came to the rescue … and got my friend some more beers.”
        
          Given this pattern of inebriation, could Kavanaugh have blacked out? Could he have done bad things and forgotten them? Again, evidence suggests he could. In an autobiographical novel about their high school years, Judge depicts a character named Bart O’Kavanaugh who “passed out on his way back from a party.” And according to Roche, during the year after the alleged assault on Ford, Kavanaugh—who was “normally reserved” when sober—became “aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk.”
        
          Kavanaugh brushes off questions about his drinking. “Yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion,” he told Martha MacCallum in a Fox News interview on Monday. “I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but that’s not what we’re talking about,” said Kavanaugh. “I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone.” When MacCallum noted Roche’s comments about Kavanaugh’s inebriation in college, Kavanaugh narrowed the question, noting that Roche didn’t specifically corroborate the incident Ramirez reported. Then MacCallum asked: “Was there ever a time that you drank so much that you couldn’t remember what happened the night before?” Kavanaugh replied: “No, that never happened.”
        
          That won’t cut it. A person who drinks to the point of passing out, and who experiences personality changes when he’s drunk, can’t reliably say what he did or didn’t do while intoxicated. And while it’s reasonable to demand evidence on the other side—you can’t just claim that somebody forgot what happened and presume him guilty—there are good grounds in Kavanaugh’s case to believe he could have forgotten. He had major alcohol issues from high school through law school. He has described drinking more than he could remember. He has been depicted, by people who knew him well, as “aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk,” and as having passed out.
        
          On Thursday, Kavanaugh faces a Senate hearing about Ford’s allegations. He will try to draw a line. At a rehearsal with White House aides last week, he “grew frustrated” with questions about his drinking and his sexual behavior, according to the Washington Post. “I’m not going to answer that,” he said. Judge doesn’t want to answer questions either. The Republicans who control the committee are planning to leave Judge out of the hearing.
        
          That’s unacceptable. The alcohol theory is arguably the most plausible explanation of what happened. It’s less crazy than Ford inventing a story and putting herself through hell so Trump can nominate a different conservative judge to the Supreme Court. It’s less crazy than two different women developing false memories about the same man. It’s less crazy than Kavanaugh being a total fraud who has conned friends and colleagues into thinking he’s a decent guy. And even if you prefer one of the other theories, this one is sufficiently plausible and well supported to merit scrutiny.
        
          If the committee won’t delegate this job to the FBI, senators must do it themselves. Ask Judge and Kavanaugh about their history with alcohol. Talk to the people who drank with them or saw them drunk. If you think alcohol could have corrupted Ford’s memory or Ramirez’s memory, ask about their drinking too. This is an investigative avenue with a strong evidentiary basis and many potential witnesses, and it puts everyone’s denials in doubt. To confirm Kavanaugh without checking it out would be a betrayal of justice.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-yearbook-male-bonding.html,"
          For what it’s worth, and absent evidence or allegations to the contrary, I believe Brett Kavanaugh’s claim that he was a virgin through his teens. I believe it in part because it squares with some of the oddities I’ve had a hard time understanding about his alleged behavior: namely, that both allegations are strikingly different from other high-profile stories the past year, most of which feature a man and a woman alone. And yet both the Kavanaugh accusations share certain features: There is no penetrative sex, there are always male onlookers, and, most importantly, there’s laughter. In each case the other men—not the woman—seem to be Kavanaugh’s true intended audience. In each story, the cruel and bizarre act the woman describes—restraining Christine Blasey Ford and attempting to remove her clothes in her allegation, and in Deborah Ramirez’s, putting his penis in front of her face—seems to have been done in the clumsy and even manic pursuit of male approval. Even Kavanaugh’s now-notorious yearbook page, with its references to the “100 kegs or bust” and the like, seems less like an honest reflection of a fun guy than a representation of a try-hard willing to say or do anything as long as his bros think he’s cool. In other words: The awful things Kavanaugh allegedly did only imperfectly correlate to the familiar frame of sexual desire run amok; they appear to more easily fit into a different category—a toxic homosociality—that involves males wooing other males over the comedy of being cruel to women.
        
          In both these accounts, Kavanaugh is laughing as he does something to a woman that disturbs or traumatizes her. Ford wrote in her letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, “Kavanaugh was on top of me while laughing with [Mark] Judge, who periodically jumped onto Kavanaugh. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me in their highly inebriated state. With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me.”
        
          “Brett was laughing,” Ramirez says in her account to the New Yorker. “I can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants.” She recalled another male student shouting about the incident. “Somebody yelled down the hall, ‘Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie’s face,’ ” she said.
        
          If these allegations are true, one of the more shocking things about them is the extent to which the woman being mistreated exists in a room where the men are performing for each other—using the woman to firm up their own bond. The Kavanaugh yearbook is littered with dumb codes that seem to speak to exactly this tendency—stuff like “boofing” and “devil’s triangle” all suggest that what mattered to Kavanaugh was displaying club membership. The question is: At whose expense?
        
          It goes without saying, I hope, that virgins are perfectly capable of doing everything Kavanaugh has so far been accused of. Offering a detail that personal was not only meant to be exculpatory in a specific sense; it was also deployed to counter an emerging image of Kavanaugh as a sleazy frat guy like his close friend and classmate Mark Judge. But he overshot the mark. If you’re going by his reactions in the Fox News interview, Kavanaugh’s wounded astonishment at the very existence of bad behavior would mean he couldn’t have known his good friend Mark Judge, who has written plenty about his own, very well at all. Kavanaugh’s strategy, in other words, was to present himself as all innocence: not just a virgin, but a virgin who’s never even heard of—let alone done!—some of the things he’s accused of. Everyone says so: “The women I knew in college and the men I knew in college said that it’s inconceivable that I could’ve done such a thing,” he said to Fox’s Martha MacCallum of Ramirez’s allegation.
        
          This is an unwise thing to claim; first, because what people say you’re capable of isn’t actually proof of what you did or didn’t do, and second, because it happens to be untrue. One of Kavanaugh’s freshman year roommates, James Roche, expressed precisely the opposite view, saying he found Ramirez’s story credible and recalling that Kavanaugh “was a notably heavy drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became excessive and belligerent when he was very drunk.” Another unnamed former classmate in the New Yorker story also used the word belligerent in describing Kavanaugh when inebriated.
        
          One thing we’ve learned about Kavanaugh, then, is that he perpetually overshoots. To put it bluntly, he lies. Rather than admit he was flawed, or made some mistakes he regrets, or simply acknowledge that different people might have seen him differently—as they demonstrably did—he’s doubling down on an unsustainable and untrue account of himself and his reputation. Under immense pressure and a bright spotlight, he claims that “the women I knew in college” and “the men I knew in college” (a large group!) will all vouch for him. This is injudicious. But it adds to an emerging profile of a man who will go to long lengths to get approval. It’s what Kavanaugh did when he accepted the nomination from Trump with a sycophantic speech that has in the months since he made it become a telling document of his exaggerated need to affirm the club he belongs to. He claimed he’d “witnessed firsthand” Trump’s “appreciation for the vital role of the American judiciary,” adding—in a burst of mendacious hyperbole—that “no president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.” And it’s what he did in that Fox interview: present himself as a friendly virgin who worked on school and service projects, and little else.
        
          A man who runs on external approval runs into problems quickly. Kavanaugh’s strategy in the Fox interview was to portray himself as a public-spirited choirboy while sitting next to his kind-looking wife: He repeatedly and proudly referred to the high school friends who “produced overnight 65 women who knew me in high school.” He staked a lot on that letter, whose signatories attested that “he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect.”
        
          Unfortunately for him, one of those much-invoked character witnesses—a woman named Renate Schroeder Dolphin, who offered her name in support of his—recently discovered how he, in turn, had used hers. The New York Times reported that Kavanaugh and a number of other graduates, including eight members of the football team, referred to themselves in the yearbook as “Renate Alumni.” The implication is obvious, and a poem from another guy’s page lays it out clearly: “You need a date/ and it’s getting late/ so don’t hesitate/ to call Renate.” When Kavanaugh included himself in this group in his yearbook page, I think we can all agree that he was neither a) “behaving honorably” as the letter attested, nor b) “treating women with dignity and respect,” as he repeatedly insisted in his Fox interview. This was not “being a good friend.” Much of what Kavanaugh said in that interview was disproved in the same day. This tells us something about how the man responds to incentives. Today, he needs to have been “a good friend” to women to be approved to the Supreme Court. Back then, he needed approval from his buddies, so he helped drag a girl’s name through the mud to get it. Today he needs to have been a virgin. Back then he needed to have slept with Renate. He’ll tell the truth as it needs to be, not as it is.
        
          Many have wondered (purely as a matter of strategy) why Kavanaugh has issued such forceful denials. Most good lawyers would advise against locking oneself in quite so firmly. But one thing that might make a guy overconfident in his ability to bluff his way out is faith in the support of his in-group. It’s Omertà. If you deny wrongdoing as a united front, you’ll get away with it.
        
          That’s where even this dumb yearbook entry thing becomes instructive: Kavanaugh was caught being cruel to a girl, and instead of owning up, he doubled down. It shows how boys who are cruel together lie together. This is why their denials are more emphatic than they need to be; each relies on the strength and intensity of the others. “Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event,” read a statement from Kavanaugh’s lawyer (she denies the kiss—I’ll take her word over his). “They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.” Yeah, right. Four of the other players depicted in the “Renate alumni” photo issued a statement claiming that the phrase was “intended to allude to innocent dates or dance partners and were generally known within the community of people involved for over 35 years.” Before laughing at the absurdity of this, it’s worth reiterating that Renate did not know. One might then reasonably ask who the phrase “the community of people involved” includes.
        
          How does the yearbook help us understand the other allegations against Kavanaugh? Well, for one thing, Kavanaugh’s admitted virginity shows how empty these rumors about Renate were. Whatever stories they circulated about her sexual behavior weren’t actually about her; to them she was less a person than a token you claim to gain status with your bros. That tells us something valuable about how Kavanaugh was willing to treat women when other guys were around. It also offers a clear window into how male networks like Kavanaugh’s work. If you get caught, you deny, and if you can’t, you manufacture explanations that may sound ridiculous to an outside audience. But you never break. His yearbook buddies tried to shelter him because sheltering him sheltered them.
        
          The fatal flaw in the Republicans’ accusations of “conspiracy” is that if you wanted to falsely accuse someone of sexual misconduct, you’d likely choose something damning and unambiguous. You probably wouldn’t include—as both allegations against Kavanaugh do—witnesses in the room who were his friends. You wouldn’t (in Ramirez’s case) admit to having been drinking. You’d have no memory gaps, express no doubts or confusion, and you’d probably claim to have been raped. Instead, the stories that have arisen so far can only really be corroborated by the perpetrator’s pals.
        
          These male witnesses universally remember nothing. Now, it’s possible they don’t remember because it never happened. Maybe they were too drunk to recall. Or maybe they’re tapping into a long tradition of male in-group protection, partly to avoid being implicated themselves. Mark Judge remembers nothing so much that he’s gone into hiding—his first and only comment to the journalist who tracked him down was, “How did you find me?” The other men Ramirez says were in the room at Yale also have “zero recollection.” It could be there’s just nothing to remember, but there are other possibilities, like a mutually exonerating code of male secrecy. Brett Kavanaugh is on the record instructing his buds to keep Omertà after a 2001 boat trip to Annapolis, Maryland—even from their wives. “Reminders to everyone to be very, very vigilant w/r/t confidentiality on all issues and all fronts, including with spouses,” he wrote after apologizing for a variety of things, including “growing aggressive after blowing still another game of dice.” By this time he wasn’t in high school. He was in the White House.
        
          Previously in Slate: Why Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation has men more afraid than ever.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-devils-triangle-boofing-renate-ralph-club.html,"
          It probably was neither Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse’s or Brett Kavanaugh’s proudest moment when the Rhode Island Democrat asked the Supreme Court nominee to explain what a “devil’s triangle” was, referring to a note in Kavanaugh’s now-infamous Georgetown Prep yearbook. An exasperated Kavanaugh claimed it was a drinking game with “three glasses in a triangle,” similar to Quarters. Right.
        
          This was just one example where Kavanaugh offered the most innocent possible explanation for his yearbook entries that a reasonable person would read as references to sex or excessive drinking. It’s not a stretch to say most of Kavanaugh’s explanations don’t pass the smell test.
        
          Take devil’s triangle. While it’s remotely possible that Kavanaugh and his friends used an idiosyncratic definition, the euphemism typically refers to a threesome with two men and one woman. This is directly pertinent to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation for obvious reasons.
        
          And this type of sexual braggadocio—even if empty (Kavanaugh said he was a virgin in high school)—would be in keeping with another point Whitehouse questioned Kavanaugh about: “Renate Alumnius.” Kavanaugh indignantly explained that Renate, a girl from a nearby school named Renate Schroeder, was “a great friend of ours” and that’s why she was referenced in several of his friends’ yearbooks and that’s why he had described himself as a “Renate Alumnius.”
        
          Are you kidding me? There are 14 references to the woman, now named Renate Dolphin, in the Georgetown Prep yearbook from 1983, according to the New York Times. This included one member of the football team describing himself as “chairman of the Bored of the Renate Club” and a photo of eight football players, including Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, subtitled “Renate Alumni”; another person who said on his page that he was a “Renate Alumnus,” also included the line: “You need a date / and it’s getting late / so don’t hesitate / to call Renate.”
        
          And then there’s boof. The reference in the yearbook is “Judge—Have You Boofed Yet?” That’s his friend Mark Judge, the alleged witness to the assault on Ford and, by his own admission, a man with a severe drinking problem at the time. Yet Kavanaugh said in the midst of testimony, during which he mentioned his past and present fondness for beer dozens of times, that he was referring to “flatulence.” Oh, please.
        
          In the yearbook, “Boofed” came right before “Beach Week Ralph Club—Biggest Contributor,” a superlative Kavanaugh said he earned not necessarily because of heavy drinking but because “I’m known to have a weak stomach … whether it’s with beer or with spicy food or anything.” When Whitehouse pursued the “Ralph Club” question further, Kavanaugh cut off any discussion of his possible excessive drinking with a recitation of his résumé. When Whitehouse tried to bring him around back to alcohol consumption—”Did it relate to alcohol? You haven’t answered that.”—Kavanaugh said, “I like beer. I like beer. I don’t know if you do” and “Do you like beer, Senator, or not?” Do you?!
        
          Whitehouse narrowed in on other references in his yearbook that appeared to imply drinking to the point of blacking out: “Georgetown vs. Louisville—Who Won That Game Anyway?” and “Orioles vs. Red Sox—Who Won, Anyway?”
        
          “Should we draw any conclusion that a loss of recollection associated with alcohol was involved in you not knowing who won the games that you attended?” Whitehouse asked. Kavanaugh clarified that he had been “watching [the games] on TV” at a party and that “we in essence were having a party and didn’t pay attention to the game even though the game was the excuse we had for getting together.”
        
          C’mon! While it’s certainly plausible to watch a game on TV and not remember the score, Kavanaugh never explained why, in a yearbook page strewn with apparent references to heavy drinking, he also included a random college basketball game and MLB game he and his friends saw on TV.
        
          Look, it feels silly to parse yearbook notations that are, literally, juvenalia. But it matters: One of the only ways to square Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony with Kavanaugh’s adamant denials is to presume that he attacked her while he was so drunk he later blacked out and had no memory of doing so. The crass sexism in these references is relevant too, as Kavanaugh has referred numerous times to his respect for women and friendship with women in high school, college, and beyond as a reason to not believe Ford’s account.
        
          A straight-A student with a close knit group of friends who enjoyed some beers on a summer weekend before going off to Yale sounds like someone who could be a Supreme Court justice. A binge-drinking football player who, along with his friends, boasted of their supposed sexual exploits at the expense of women sounds like something else entirely.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-problematic-drinking-hearing.html,"
          I have a friend who is a survivor of sexual assault. I thought about her a lot as I watched Christine Blasey Ford testify on Thursday. I made sure to check on her a few times throughout the morning to see if she was doing all right, and I admired the community of survivors online who I observed taking care of each other, thanks to #MeToo.
        
          I took a break for lunch, then turned the television back on to see Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testify. I sometimes feel the word trigger is overused, and I have never felt entitled to it because I am not a sexual assault survivor. But as I watched Kavanaugh’s testimony, I can only think that what I experienced was triggering. Alcoholism runs through my family, and what I saw every time Kavanaugh was questioned about his drinking was achingly familiar. The defiance, the casual references to “liking beer,” the mentioning of a friend who has a real problem, the insistence that he was the “Ralph King” because he has a “delicate stomach,” the turning the question on the questioner—all are tactics of the person with alcoholism who has been cornered. I’ve seen this scene before—in a kitchen, and in a driveway. But I was stunned to see it on the floor of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
        
          I watched some of the news analysis of the hearing, hoping this angle would be discussed. But while there’s been quite a bit of discussion about Kavanaugh’s high school and college habits, there’s been very little discussion about his drinking now. Yet Kavanaugh used the present tense often. He said “I like beer” a number of times. He even asked two of the senators what they like to drink, the implication being now, not when they were in high school. When pressed during the hearing about whether he drank to excess in the past, Kavanaugh avoided the question and instead recited his accomplishments: Yale, Yale Law School, 12 years a federal judge. But high achievement in these realms doesn’t actually tell us anything about Kavanaugh’s drinking habits, now or in the past. Going to Yale is not an assurance of sobriety, and it does not rule out the possibility that he was also a problem drinker.
        
          Based on the testimony of Ford and numerous accounts of people who knew, and drank with, Kavanaugh in college, we have good reason to believe that he abused alcohol in his youth. Liz Swisher, a former classmate, has said, “He drank heavily. He was a partier. He liked to do beer bongs. He played drinking games. He was a sloppy drunk.” Another acquaintance, Charles Ludington, released a statement saying, “On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive.” We do not know whether he continues to drink this way, but the way he responded to questions about his past drinking makes it a relevant question. And yet, even in one of the most charged Senate committee hearings in decades, no one was willing to ask about his current drinking habits.
        
          We have finally moved our understanding of rape from something that is perpetrated by strangers in dark alleyways at night to a more realistic view of the crime as one that is often committed by close associates and even loved ones in familiar places. Just so, we need to adjust our understanding of alcoholism and problematic drinking. It is not just the drunk in a gutter or the person who sneaks shots before work. It is also the people who don’t drink all the time but who have a hard time limiting consumption once they start, people who frequently black out, and people who behave in ways that are inconsistent with their sober selves when they are drinking.
        
          But we don’t talk about this much, because in our culture, drinking is so socially acceptable it is uncomfortable to question another person’s drinking habits. We saw that in the hearing when two senators tried to do it. Sen. Whitehouse looked down. Sen. Klobuchar looked nervous, even after revealing that her father is in recovery. Both times the line of questioning was aborted due to the defiance of the witness. But when the red flags of addiction present themselves, we have a duty to ask these hard questions of family, of friends, and of our public officials in whom we place our trust.
        
          I wish this could be a moment for people to talk more openly and honestly about problem drinking. It is painfully clear that our country does not know how to talk about it, just as once we didn’t know how to talk about rape, but the two are actually very related. Many men in the corridors of power share Kavanaugh’s prep school and frat-boy background. They do not see, or do not want to see, evidence that his drinking may be problematic. But others, like me, may have watched these hearings and may have finally had enough. There is plenty of debate over the scope of the FBI investigation, but I think it would be worthwhile for it to attempt to assess Kavanaugh’s drinking behavior not when he was in high school or college, but right now.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-lied-senate-judiciary-committee.html,"
          On Thursday, after listening to testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, several Republican senators said they would vote to confirm the nominee because it’s impossible to determine which witness—Ford or Kavanaugh—is telling the truth. Actually, it’s easy. We don’t know for certain whether Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford. But we do know that Kavanaugh lied repeatedly in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Here are some of his lies.
        
          1. “It’s been investigated.” The White House has ignored multiple requests from Democratic senators to authorize FBI interviews with the alleged witnesses in the case. In particular, there has been no FBI or Judiciary Committee interview with Mark Judge, Kavanaugh’s accused accomplice in the alleged assault. In fact, Judge has fled to a hideout in Delaware to avoid being called to testify.
        
          During the hearing, several Democratic senators pleaded with Kavanaugh to call for FBI interviews so that the truth could be resolved. Kavanaugh refused. When Sen. Chris Coons pointed out that the FBI had needed only a few days to complete interviews in the Clarence Thomas–Anita Hill case, Kavanaugh said even that was too much, because the Judiciary Committee had already examined his case. “It’s been investigated,” he told Coons.
        
          No honest judge would say that. None of the alleged witnesses, other than Ford and Kavanaugh, has been interviewed. Instead, the alleged witnesses have issued short statements of nonrecollection and have asked not to testify. The committee’s Republican majority, eager to brush the case aside, has accepted these statements and has refused to ask further questions. In his testimony, Kavanaugh falsely claimed that FBI interviews would add nothing. Agents would “just go and do what you’re doing,” he told the senators.
        
          Kavanaugh claimed that a vague statement of nonrecollection from Judge’s lawyer was sufficient “testimony.” He dismissed calls for Judge to appear before the committee, arguing that his own testimony was adequate. But Kavanaugh also mocked the committee’s Democrats, who lack the power of subpoena, by telling them to go talk to Judge. When Sen. Patrick Leahy asked whether Bart O’Kavanaugh, a drunken character in Judge’s book, was meant to represent Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee passed the buck to his testimony-evading friend: “You’d have to ask him.”
        
          2. “All four witnesses say it didn’t happen.” Each time senators pleaded for an FBI review or a more thorough investigation by the committee, Kavanaugh replied that it wasn’t necessary, since all the people Ford claimed had been at the gathering where the alleged assault occurred had rejected her story. Eight times, Kavanaugh claimed that the witnesses “said it didn’t happen.” Three times, he said the witnesses “refuted” Ford’s story. Four times, Kavanaugh claimed that “Dr. Ford’s longtime friend,” Leland Keyser, had affirmed that the gathering never occurred.
        
          That’s a lie. Keyser has stated that she doesn’t recall the gathering—she was never told about the attack, and she was supposedly downstairs while it allegedly occurred upstairs—but that she believes Ford’s story. That isn’t corroboration, but it isn’t refutation or denial, either. During the hearing, Sen. Cory Booker pointed this out to Kavanaugh, reminding him that in an interview with the Washington Post, Keyser “said she believes Dr. Ford.” Kavanaugh ignored Booker’s correction. Ninety seconds later, the nominee defiantly repeated: “The witnesses who were there say it didn’t happen.”
        
          3. “I know exactly what happened that night.” Kavanaugh made several false or widely contradicted statements about his use of alcohol. This is significant because Judge has admitted to drunken blackouts, which raises the possibility that Judge and Kavanaugh don’t remember what they did to Ford. During the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked about Kavanaugh’s participation in a night of drunken revelry at Yale Law School. Kavanaugh assured Blumenthal, “I know exactly what happened the whole night.” Later, Booker asked Kavanaugh whether he had “never had gaps in memories, never had any losses whatsoever, never had foggy recollection about what happened” while drinking. Kavanaugh affirmed that he had never experienced such symptoms: “That’s what I said.”
        
          These statements contradict reports from several people who knew Kavanaugh. Liz Swisher, a friend from Yale, says she saw Kavanaugh drink a lot, stumble, and slur his words. “It’s not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess,” she told the Washington Post. And in a speech four years ago, Kavanaugh described himself and a former classmate “piecing things together” to figure out that they’d “had more than a few beers” before an alcohol-soaked banquet at Yale Law School.
        
          4. “I’m in Colorado.” As evidence that the charges against him were ludicrous, Kavanaugh told the committee that he had been falsely accused of committing an assault more than 1,500 miles away. He claimed that according to his accusers, “I’m in Colorado, you know, I’m sighted all over the place.” But a transcript of Kavanaugh’s Sept. 25 interview with Judiciary Committee staffers shows no claim of an offense in Colorado. The transcript says that according to a woman from Colorado, “at least four witnesses” saw Kavanaugh shove a woman “up against the wall very aggressively and sexually” in 1998. But Kavanaugh was specifically told during the interview that the scene of the alleged incident was in D.C., where he was living at the time.
        
          Kavanaugh also told other whoppers.* He claimed that his high school yearbook reference to the “Beach Week Ralph Club” referred in part to his difficulty in holding down “spicy food.” He claimed that the entry’s jokes about two sporting events he and his high school buddies had watched—“Who won that game, anyway?”—had nothing to do with booze. And he defended his refusal to take a polygraph test on the grounds that such tests aren’t admissible in federal courts—neglecting to mention that he had endorsed their use in hiring and law enforcement.
        
          Maybe Kavanaugh is an honest man in other contexts. Maybe he’s a good husband, a loving dad, and an inspiring coach. And maybe there’s no way to be certain that he assaulted Ford. But one thing is certain: He lied repeatedly to the Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Some of his lies, about the testimony of witnesses and the integrity of investigations, go to the heart of our system of justice. Any senator who votes to put this man on the Supreme Court is saying that such lies don’t matter.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-constitutional-crisis.html,"
          By all indications, Brett Kavanaugh is about to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, where he will become part of a five-justice conservative bloc that will swiftly roll back decades of progressive jurisprudence. His confirmation will be a major victory for the Republican Party and its leader, Donald Trump, who will soon succeed in entrenching GOP control over the court for at least a generation. But as soon as Kavanaugh takes the oath, he will plunge the Supreme Court into a legitimacy crisis that could weaken its power over the long term. This crisis will become particularly acute if Democrats retake Congress and the presidency but find their reforms stymied by a reactionary judiciary. The broad consensus over the court’s authority to interpret the Constitution will crumble. If that all comes to pass, Kavanaugh’s appointment may come to be seen as a Pyrrhic victory not just for Trump but for the entire conservative movement.
        
          The Supreme Court has always needed buy-in from the political branches to enforce its rulings. As my colleague Dahlia Lithwick wrote in 2016, the court “relies on us to believe that it’s magic. The power and legitimacy of the whole institution depend upon the idea that regardless of the political maelstrom surrounding it, the court is doing just fine and always will be.” Remarkably, throughout most of American history, this magic trick has worked. It came closest to collapse after 2000’s Bush v. Gore, when five Republican appointees justices indefensibly elevated their preferred candidate to the presidency. At that point, liberals could have declared war on the court, challenging the central role it had assumed in American politics.
        
          They didn’t, for two reasons: Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy. The two swing justices handed the left a stream of victories following Bush v. Gore, upholding affirmative action, affirming campaign finance restrictions, strengthening Roe v. Wade, striking down sodomy bans, and securing the rights of Guantanamo detainees. After the hard-line conservative Justice Samuel Alito replaced O’Connor, the court lurched rightward, weakening Roe, gutting campaign finance laws, and undermining voting rights. But because Kennedy still delivered the occasional progressive victory—most notably, his marriage-equality rulings—Democrats still tended to see the court as moderate and equitable.
        
          Democratic approval of the court plummeted after the GOP blockaded Merrick Garland, Barack Obama’s final SCOTUS nominee, and instead allowed Trump to appoint the far-right Neil Gorsuch. But while plenty of progressive advocates and politicians insisted that Gorsuch was an “illegitimate” justice in a “stolen” seat, few seriously contested the validity of his votes. That’s probably because Gorsuch didn’t alter the balance of the court and wasn’t a flagrant partisan (despite some ethical lapses). During his confirmation hearing and on the bench, Gorsuch behaved more or less like a judge, not a GOP operative out to do his party’s bidding.
        
          Kavanaugh is different in all respects. He will drag the court far to the right, eroding Roe, marriage equality, campaign finance restrictions, voting rights, affirmative action, and the separation of church and state. Democrats’ respect for the court, already diminished, will plunge to new lows each time Kavanaugh casts the fifth vote in a controversial 5–4 ruling.
        
          But most important is Kavanaugh’s image as both a partisan pugilist and an alleged sexual abuser. Democrats overwhelmingly believe Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. They’re disgusted by the extensive reports of his allegedly boorish conduct throughout high school and college, including lewd sexual jokes, heavy drinking, and alleged indecent exposure. And they’re convinced that Kavanaugh lied about this behavior under oath in his testimony last week—when, in an unprecedented display of partisanship, Kavanaugh lashed out against Democrats and the broader American left.
        
          No matter how courteously Kavanaugh behaves on the court, many Democrats will always see him as the man who blamed “friends of the Clintons” for trying to thwart his confirmation. They will dismiss his votes as the product of political bias. It might not matter much at first: So long as Republicans maintain their grasp on power, they can enforce the court’s decisions through legislation, executive orders, and, if necessary, the National Guard.
        
          But what happens when Democrats take back the legislative and executive branches? What if Democrats pass Medicare for All, and the Supreme Court strikes it down, with Kavanaugh casting the decisive fifth vote? It’s not hard to envision Democrats marching in the streets, demanding that the president and Congress ignore the ruling. And what if they do? What happens if the Department of Health and Human Services just … implements the law anyway? It’s easy to envision the presidential statement: As the chief executive, it is my duty to enact this legislation, passed through the democratic process, and to reject the illegitimate ruling of Donald Trump’s Supreme Court. The federal government, acting on orders of the president, opens enrollment, and Congress appropriates the funds as planned. What can the Supreme Court do? Send its tiny police force to storm the White House?
        
          Or imagine if the court abolishes affirmative action, and some state—say, New Jersey—refuses to comply. Or what if the court strikes down California’s independent redistricting commission, granting state legislators untrammeled ability to gerrymander congressional districts, and the governor insists on preserving it? The same goes for all manner of progressive reforms that could be on Kavanaugh’s chopping block, such as minimum wage laws and public financing of elections. Blue states may be pressured to disregard his decisions. And the president could decline to compel them to follow the high court’s rulings.
        
          In 2003, Justice Stephen Breyer referred to the “miracle” of national compliance with the court’s edicts, even in the wake of “controversial decisions” like Bush v. Gore. There is nothing inevitable or self-sustaining about this “miracle.” Courts do have some tools to mandate adherence to their orders—namely, their ability to hold individuals in contempt of court. But judges will surely hesitate to hold governors, legislators, and Cabinet secretaries in contempt. The truth is that we haven’t seen massive resistance to the Supreme Court since the segregation battles of the 1950s and ’60s. And despite two presidents’ celebrated efforts to integrate schools with the help of the National Guard, the South’s resistance succeeded in slowing the pace of desegregation.
        
          This precedent is appalling. But it demonstrates that the playbook can work. Progressives should recognize the danger in adopting the tactics of segregationists. Getting to the point of massive liberal resistance to the court would require a significant psychological shift, since the left has long viewed the Supreme Court as a saving grace. Kavanaugh’s confirmation alone won’t bring Democrats all the way there. But if he leads the court into a frenzy of reactionary jurisprudence, progressives may feel they have no other alternative.
        
          No matter the end result of liberal defiance, it will likely transform the Supreme Court’s legitimacy crisis into a full-blown constitutional crisis. Kavanaugh’s confirmation will have poisoned the foundation of the judiciary’s authority. The Supreme Court derives its power from the belief that it sits above the political fray. Brett Kavanaugh is poised to shatter that illusion.

          When Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh was over, it wasn’t quite clear what had hit those of us who’d been sitting in the room. The hearing room in Dirksen is tiny, and while the slammed binder and the escalating shouting of the nominee might have looked pretty dramatic on TV, inside the chamber, the effect was that of an out-of-control house party. Too loud, too scary, too close, too real. Like being locked inside something terrible with the music cranked up.
        
          Anita Hill once told me that, in 1991, Clarence Thomas had race and she had only gender. But now, in 2018, Brett Kavanaugh had rage and Christine Blasey Ford had only gender. With the Senate Judiciary Committee moving on Friday to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate without any further inquiry around Blasey Ford’s damning and plainly credible testimony that Kavanaugh had gleefully and drunkenly sexually assaulted her at a 1982 house party as his buddy Mark Judge watched, it appears as though his rage alone will have been enough to earn him life tenure on the highest court in the land.
        
          The dynamic of Thursday’s hearing was consistent: He had fury, and contempt, and seething threats that the republic would pay if he were thwarted. She had to functionally lie back and try not to infuriate anyone, as Republicans cowered behind the female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, they had brought on to interrogate her. That was until it was Kavanaugh’s turn to speak, when they quickly jettisoned that paper-thin pretense of investigative “independence” and joined Kavanaugh to form a chorus of angry shouting men. They towered silently over Mitchell for the first half of the hearing, then summarily ignored her when she wasn’t offering questions fast or furious enough to protect their nominee.
        
          At least Anita Hill was insulted, demeaned, and discredited to her face. Ford was patronized, thanked, and told that she was very, very credible. Over and over she was told she’d been given a “safe space” to tell her story; as if a safe space substitutes for reasoned process and investigation. She was given a safe space and then dismissed as though she were some character in a very sad French movie that had been very affecting indeed but had nothing to do with the great man and his destiny. After presenting an undeniable narrative—and one the nobody ever really attempted to specifically refute—she was told that her credibility didn’t count for anything because a man was bellowing and injured, that whatever had happened to her was not as important as his pain. And Senate Republicans—having tucked Mitchell back into her naughty chair—were delighted to bellow and yelp of horrid injuries they too had sustained alongside their guy.
        
          Of course, the purported wrong was the process. Again, the villain of the piece was Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who had kept Ford’s July letter outlining one of Kavanaugh’s alleged crimes in confidence at her request until eventually forwarding it to the FBI for inquiry earlier this month. Don’t be fooled, though: Feinstein would have been screamed at just as furiously had she come forward weeks or months earlier with Ford’s report, and another pretext for dismissing Ford and her witnesses would have been concocted.
        
          As GOP rage gathered steam, we were told that this needed to be treated as a criminal proceeding—innocent until proven guilty—and the Republicans contended that there was no evidence of criminal conduct. But, of course there was evidence: compelling firsthand testimony and numerous supporting accounts. And of course, they refused to subpoena the key witness to the event, opting instead for the “we take his word for it” route of investigation by registered letter. The “hearing,” as expected, had been staged as a puppet show of “credibility.” And absent witnesses, or evidence, or any mechanism for fact finding, both sides could be called credible and Brett Kavanaugh could still be confirmed. On Friday, Sen. Jeff Flake—perhaps the Senate’s greatest profile in cowardice masquerading as courage—said that he would cast the key vote to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination out of the committee. Despite the lack of anything resembling a meaningful investigation, which Ford and the other women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual violence have repeatedly requested, and the judge has repeatedly declined to request, it now appears Kavanaugh will be confirmed. His fate rests in the hands of Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Joe Manchin.* Given her mind-bending bravery and likely folk-hero status, one hopes that Ford will not now come to believe that her decision was made in vain. But it was impossible on Friday morning not to think of her own description of her reluctance to come forward out of fear that she would “just be jumping in front of a train that was headed to where it was headed anyway.”
        
          Ultimately, he had rage and she had gender, and a “job interview” was recast as though it would result in a lifelong criminal conviction with a death sentence on the line for the man in the dock. Calling no witnesses and accepting no supporting testimony were a perfect way to ensure that he would be innocent of all charges. She had gender. They were sorry for her loss.
        
          Brett Kavanaugh is never going to understand that women don’t sort themselves into those upon which he bestows his munificence (clerks, girls in plaid skirts) and those he can shout at, and bully, like Feinstein and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Feminism doesn’t mean you get to pick which women you patronize and which you can insult. Brett Kavanaugh is also unlikely to understand that justice doesn’t mean demanding your lifetime appointment because it’s your time.
        
          Put aside whether any sane litigant can have any confidence in the justice system after the man who will be the decisive vote on the court made it manifestly clear that he believes half the country, and the media, and liberal dark money were all in on a conspiracy to take him out. Because of the Clintons. This wasn’t ultimately a hearing about whether Kavanaugh deserved to be elevated to the high court. It was a blind partisan tantrum in which he dragged the judicial branch down to a place of ugliness and rancor from which it will not soon recover.
        
          Others have detailed the incomplete answers, the fact that he wasn’t questioned correctly about his calendar, the ways in which his claims that he had been exonerated by other witnesses were absolutely distorted, and the laughable claims about his well-documented and widely known drinking and his “sensitive stomach.” While Ford offered exacting answers, Kavanaugh repeated half-truths and conspiracy theories and sneered and slammed through a fog of rage. It was a perfect contrast not just to Ford’s conduct, but to that of Merrick Garland, who never said a word when the seat to which he was entitled was yanked away.
        
          There were two distinct moods in the Kavanaugh hearing: Ford evoked undistilled sadness and vulnerability; Kavanaugh evoked raw fear that if he were ever crossed, he would lose control. Do. Not. Make. Him. Angry. is the new judicial temperament. It is the perfect metaphorical springboard to the highest court in the land, where he will say he’s calling balls and strikes while he froths with contempt at those he believes coordinated against him: Be very afraid. This is what we will call “justice” now.

          On Monday night, Donald Trump led the entire U.S. Supreme Court into an ambush. At a ceremonial swearing-in for Trump’s latest appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the president launched into a political diatribe that made a majority of the court visibly uncomfortable. “On behalf of our nation,” Trump declared, “I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure.” He decried the “campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,” and asserted that Kavanaugh had been “proven innocent” of sexual assault allegations. Then he praised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Susan Collins, the latter of whom he credited for supporting Kavanaugh in a “brave and eloquent speech.”
        
          Fifteen hours after this GOP pep rally, the justices assembled at the Supreme Court to hear arguments in two criminal sentencing cases, marking the first time Kavanaugh took his new seat on the bench. If Chief Justice John Roberts hadn’t formally welcomed his new colleague—“We wish you a long and happy career in our common calling”—it would’ve been tough to tell that anything had changed. The justices settled into their groove, and Kavanaugh jumped into the action, seemingly right at home. While the rest of the country continues to convulse over his confirmation, the justices seem determined to move past Monday’s partisan spectacle and go about their business as usual.
        
          This projection of continuity—of legitimacy, really—stood in remarkable contrast to the bizarre White House event the entire court had been forced to endure. Before waxing lyrical about his Republican allies, Trump thanked each member of the court individually for attending the ceremony. The justices, unsure how to respond to this scripted demonstration of gratitude, took turns awkwardly acknowledging the president. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg looked up, then away from Trump. Justice Stephen Breyer flashed a nervous grin. Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be in physical pain.
        
          After that, the justices mostly clasped their hands together and stared at the ground. They looked uneasy before Trump started commending the (Republican) lawmakers who’d helped elevate Kavanaugh to the bench. Once those blandishments began, the justices either held their applause or clapped with polite restraint, like a parent applauding someone else’s kid at a recital. Only Justice Clarence Thomas, a friend of the Trump administration, heartily applauded each politician, clapping with special vigor for Mitch McConnell.
        
          It’s safe to assume that none of the justices expected to be used as props at a small-scale Trump rally. (“Joining us for tonight’s ceremony is every sitting Supreme Court justice!” Trump announced before the painful thank-a-thon.) Justice Neil Gorsuch’s 2017 White House ceremony was, by comparison, a muted affair; back then, Trump refrained from attacking Democrats or exalting in the glory of every Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But Kavanaugh’s confirmation was much harder fought than Gorsuch’s and hit closer to home for Trump. The accusations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh clearly rankled the president on a personal level. And he couldn’t resist reminding Democrats that their “lies and deception” had failed to foil his second Supreme Court pick.
        
          The justices looked much more comfortable as they filed onto the bench Tuesday morning. Before arguments began, Kavanaugh chatted amiably with his new seatmate, Justice Elena Kagan; the two whispered and laughed like old friends. When Kavanaugh asked his questions, he appeared determined to prove he was prepared, even citing the exact page of a precedent to prove a point. But he was also respectful to his colleagues and courteous with attorneys—a stark contrast with Gorsuch’s notorious early days on the bench, when he subtweeted Alito and talked over everyone.
        
          Tuesday’s cases are not blockbusters, but they will provide a glimpse into what kind of conservative Kavanaugh will be: a law-and-order stickler (like Alito) or a libertarian formalist (like Gorsuch). Both involve the Armed Career Criminal Act, a draconian federal law that jacks up sentences for repeat offenders. ACCA is plagued by maddeningly hazy language, and the court has already lopped off a key provision, ruling that it violated due process. The latest cases require the court to determine how much “physical force” a defendant must employ during the commission of his crime to qualify for ACCA’s sentence enhancement and whether burglary of a vehicle triggers its penalties.
        
          ACCA’s only consistent defender on the Supreme Court is Alito, who did not attempt to conceal his frustration with the court’s gradual demolition of the law. “You’re not exactly on a winning streak here in ACCA cases,” Alito told Erica Ross, a government attorney. “You might have gotten a hint that a majority of the court really hates ACCA and is picking it apart bit by bit by bit.” He added: “In my humble opinion, in this area, we have made one royal mess. Maybe we ought to go back and correct our own mess.”
        
          Alito must have been pleased, then, when Kavanaugh asked a series of questions that evinced skepticism toward criminal defense attorneys’ efforts to narrow ACCA’s scope. Kavanaugh is not a tactical questioner; he doesn’t try to shatter an argument he disagrees with and bolster one he likes. But he was notably deferential to the Justice Department lawyers who are trying to prop up ACCA—another stark comparison with Gorsuch, who peppered the DOJ attorneys with sharp inquiries.
        
          Although everybody leaned forward in anticipation the first few times Kavanaugh spoke up, he seemed like an old hand. The other justices slipped into their routines, too. Ginsburg quibbled with Alito. Breyer asked a quixotic, multipart question that was really more of a cry for help. Justice Sonia Sotomayor leaned over and pinched Gorsuch to illustrate a hypothetical, and Gorsuch made a funny face. Thomas leaned back and closed his eyes for several minutes.
        
          The court, in short, tried very hard to ignore the months of political warfare and emotional agony that preceded Kavanaugh’s admission to its private club. Democrats hoping for the liberal bloc to disregard or ostracize the newest justice will be sorely disappointed. These justices recognize that Kavanaugh throws the court’s legitimacy in peril, and are eager to shore up its institutional prestige. That requires playing nice with Kavanaugh. These justices could have declined their invite to the White House on Monday night or given their new colleague the cold shoulder on Tuesday morning. They did not. Instead, they embraced him as one of their own.
        
          Progressives may find Kavanaugh’s warm reception at the court objectionable, even repulsive. They may believe that, by treating him with such respect, the liberal justices are legitimizing him, helping him to cast off the cloud of doubt that followed him to the bench. But these justices do not want to lose any hope of grabbing his vote in a closely divided case—and they all place the court’s eminence above their own proclivities. A large portion of the country may still condemn him. But within the Supreme Court, there will be no resistance to Justice Kavanaugh.

          “I don’t get to pick and choose which Supreme Court precedents I get to follow,” Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. “I follow them all.”
        
          While that’s a nice line, Kavanaugh’s record reveals a judge who is eager to warp precedent to fit his ideological preferences—most flagrantly with regard to guns and abortion. In a pair of major opinions, Kavanaugh proved adept at constraining Roe v. Wade and bolstering D.C. v. Heller, manipulating the law to throttle the liberty of women and aggrandize the rights of gun owners. His precedential chicanery offers clear proof that Kavanaugh will overturn Roe and strike down assault-weapons bans once he reaches the Supreme Court. And he only has to pretend otherwise for a few more weeks.
        
          In 2011, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent arguing that a D.C. law banning certain military-grade assault weapons—namely, semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15—was unconstitutional. How, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein wondered, could Kavanaugh reach that conclusion when the Supreme Court has held only that the Constitution protects the use of handguns in the home?
        
          “In the Second Amendment context,” a poker-faced Kavanaugh began, “the Supreme Court, in the Heller decision, written by Justice Scalia, had held that there was an individual right to bear arms.” Correct! He added that Scalia “pre-identified a number of [gun restrictions] that would be allowed,” including the prohibition of “dangerous and unusual weapons.” Also true. But then Kavanaugh asserted that in order to determine whether a weapon is dangerous enough to be banned, Scalia instructed the courts to examine whether it is in “common use.” Under his reading of Heller, Kavanaugh declared, a weapon cannot be outlawed if it is commonly used by Americans. And because semi-automatic rifles “are widely possessed in the United States,” the District of Columbia has no authority to ban them.
        
          Wait, really? Could it really be that a specific type of gun, even mass shooters’ weapon of choice, gains constitutional protection just because lots of Americans buy it? Not according to Heller. Kavanaugh’s theory rests on a willful misreading of Scalia’s opinion. What the ruling actually says is that “the sorts of weapons protected” are, at a minimum, those “in common use at the time” of the Second Amendment’s ratification. At the time—that means in 1791, not today. Scalia used the phrase common use three times in Heller; in each instance, it is followed by the words at the time. Moreover, this concept did not lie at the heart of Scalia’s opinion. It was, rather, an effort to link his analysis to the 18th century “well regulated militia” described in the amendment.
        
          There’s another reason why Kavanaugh’s fixation on “common use” makes no sense. Two years after Heller, the Supreme Court issued McDonald v. Chicago, holding that states are also barred from banning handguns in the home. (Heller applied only to D.C.) McDonald did not deploy Kavanaugh’s “common use” test or even use that phrase. Instead, it reiterated what Heller had made perfectly clear: The Second Amendment protects handguns, not assault weapons. Yet Kavanaugh ignored this fact in order to craft a new, expansive rule that would deprive citizens of their ability to protect their communities from weapons of war. That isn’t “strictly and carefully [following] the Supreme Court precedent,” as Kavanaugh claimed. It’s distorting precedent to impose your own policy preferences on the law.
        
          Kavanaugh turns out to be pretty good at that, as Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin seemed to imply when he questioned the judge about his dissent in the case Garza v. Hargan. In Garza, the Trump administration attempted to bar an undocumented 17-year-old (known as Jane Doe) being held in a Texas shelter from terminating her pregnancy. The government argued that this prohibition did not constitute an “undue burden” in violation of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a landmark SCOTUS precedent that prevents the government from creating a “substantial obstacle” to abortion access. Why? Because Jane Doe could simply leave the country or try to find a sponsor who would take custody of her and, perhaps, let her get an abortion. (Doe was 16 weeks pregnant; Texas bans abortion after 20 weeks, and the process of securing a sponsor takes months.)
        
          As a matter of law, the Trump administration’s position was dead wrong. It’s true that the Supreme Court has allowed states to impose special limitations on minors seeking abortions—namely, parental consent or notification. But it has also compelled states to let minors get permission from a judge when asking their parents is impossible or dangerous. As required by Texas law, Doe requested and received this “judicial bypass” from a state judge. And so, under Supreme Court precedent, she discharged the only obligation that states may demand of minors before they get an abortion.
        
          Kavanaugh didn’t see it that way. In a furious dissent, he accused the majority of creating “a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.” He would’ve let the administration continue delaying Doe’s abortion while she sought a sponsor (likely in vain). When Durbin challenged Kavanaugh’s abortion-on-demand accusation on Wednesday, the nominee demurred: “I look at precedent. And the most analogous precedent is the parental consent precedent … [that says] minors benefit from consultation about abortion.” Thus, he concluded that the government may force Jane Doe “to consult about the abortion” with a hypothetical sponsor, even if doing so dangerously delays the procedure.
        
          There is a vast chasm between Kavanaugh’s interpretive approaches to Heller and Casey. When evaluating the rights of gun owners, he imbued Heller with an atextual maximalism, twisting its words to prohibit a gun law that he plainly dislikes. When evaluating the rights of a teenager seeking an abortion, he cabined Casey and its progeny to their facts, then kept whittling until nothing remained of their constitutional guarantees. As University of California–Irvine law professor Leah Litman noted, Kavanaugh is an expert at reading pro-choice precedent as narrowly as possible, to the point of disingenuousness if not outright mendacity.
        
          We will hear plenty more from Kavanaugh on Thursday about the timeless beauty and utmost gravity of precedent—about how he hews closely to it and would continue doing so on the Supreme Court. Don’t believe it. Justice Neil Gorsuch said the same thing during his confirmation hearings, then promptly overturned a 40-year-old precedent via his vote in Janus v. AFSCME. Kavanaugh is reading from a script, one he will jettison as soon as he dons his robe at SCOTUS. And no senator, Democrat or Republican, need pretend that he cares any more about precedent than he does about the liberty and dignity of Jane Doe.

          This, then, was the fatal flaw of #MeToo: We thought that patriarchal systems, based in entrenched power, and supported by others in power, could be brought down by individual, brave women.
        
          Why don’t women come forward? The story now unfolding on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and an unidentified woman who alleges that he sexually assaulted her when they were in high school underscores why. This is what we do know: The woman went to her congresswoman with a complaint about President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, that dated back to high school. The complaint is that he and another boy violently assaulted (but did not rape) her at a party. She put that complaint in a letter, which the congresswoman will not discuss, citing confidentiality. That letter was also sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office, who promised confidentiality.
        
          In adhering to this promise of confidentiality, Feinstein’s office did not share the letter with other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and did not question Kavanaugh about the event during his hearings. It was only this week that other Democrats got wind of the letter and began to demand that its contents be shared with them. On Wednesday, the Intercept was the first to report on the controversy, and on Friday morning, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at the New Yorker reported the specifics of the allegations contained in the letter:
        
          Feinstein’s team explained its decision to not make the letter public in the following statement:
        
          What we can gather from this chain of events is that at some point this summer, the woman changed her mind—as the New Yorker put it, “after the interactions with Eshoo’s and Feinstein’s offices, the woman decided not to speak about the matter publicly.” We can litigate until the end of time whether Senate Democrats should have been given the letter sooner and who was in the best position to evaluate the weight of her claims. The better question is why a woman making claims about a sexual attack would change her mind about levying them. The controversy that has ensued since the Intercept publicized the existence of this letter and its accusation serves as a perfectly coherent argument for why.
        
          Almost anyone who has played any part in the #MeToo movement might say with confidence that the cost of coming forward is crippling. And indeed, as soon as the New Yorker published its story, Kavanaugh defenders were quick to say that the woman, still unnamed, was a drunk and a liar. Had I been asked to advise this woman, who, according to the New Yorker, is already in trauma, and according to CNN has sought medical help for it, I would have told her to stand down. I would have told her that neither politics nor journalism are institutions that can evaluate and adjudicate facts about systems in which powerful men use their power to harm women. I would have told her that she would be risking considerable peril to her personal reputation, even as she would be lauded as a hero. I would have also told her that powerful men have about a three-month rehabilitation period through which they must live, after which they can be swept up once again in the slipstream of their own fame and success. The women of #MeToo, though, are never quite welcome in the slipstream again. And if you closely observe how one of the most intimate and frightening moments of this anonymous woman’s life is currently being tossed around for political gain, I suspect you might come to agree with me.
        
          The real tragedy is that we do not need this woman’s story to understand who the current Supreme Court nominee is. Because here is what we do know about Judge Kavanaugh: We know that he clerked for and had a yearslong close relationship with a serial abuser of women and claims he knew nothing about it. He claims he doesn’t recall being on a hypersexualized and misogynistic email list and claims he didn’t bother to search to determine whether he was. He claims that when the serial abuser of women for whom he clerked was revealed to be a serial abuser of women, he believed the victims and yet called the abuser, because he was worried about the abuser’s mental health. Worrying more about the accused judge than the accusers one claims to believe is the system protecting the system. This is why women don’t come forward.
        
          Here is what we do know about Judge Kavanaugh. We know that he was part of a group of young men who saw fit to write a creepy racist and misogynistic email chain—and to pledge to keep it secret. We also know that the “neutral” George W. Bush lawyer who vetted Kavanaugh’s papers (and also represents the disgraced judge for whom Kavanaugh once clerked) deemed one of those emails classified, even though it contained no national security or political secrets. Withholding that email was the system protecting the system. That is why women don’t come forward.
        
          Here is what we do know about Judge Kavanaugh. He had an opportunity to use all these questions around all these periods in his life to say anything at all about men and power and the female victims of that power, and about the systems that protect and reify and rehabilitate men in power, and he said nothing. Worse, he said he believed the victims of that system while still doing nothing to support or credit them. This is why women don’t come forward.
        
          And so, a woman considered coming forward to the Senate Judiciary Committee. We’ve seen this movie before, and it doesn’t end well for her. We do not know who she is, or what her precise claims were, or how credible they might be, or whether she had reported the episode contemporaneously, or whether there were other witnesses. We know nothing. What we do know is that she was promised confidentiality and that reporters are now camped out on her doorstep offering to help her become a hero to the #MeToo movement.
        
          The problem is that demanding that any one woman bear the full professional and social and emotional cost of dismantling the machinery of men in power propping up other men in power is expecting entirely too much. We already know that one victim speaking up isn’t enough. The entire vast apparatus of the institution will be brought to bear against her, and that is the same apparatus that she must report to and hope to be believed by, all while knowing she must continue to work within it. Asking that any one woman do such a thing isn’t just a call for moral heroism. It’s also irrational.
        
          It’s particularly irrational when the man in question is in the process of being confirmed to a Supreme Court seat with political stakes that are beyond high. The system that has gotten Brett Kavanaugh to this point has done so by scrambling powerful former clerks to defend him, and positioning powerful Republican lawyers to classify his emails, and standing together to simultaneously claim that it believes the Kozinski accusers and also believes they are political operatives sent to embarrass him. Why would we think that this is a system into which we could input a complicated allegation of sexual misconduct and get out anything rational or fact-based in return?
        
          In a statement released late Friday, Anita Hill noted that she has seen firsthand what happens when an ostensibly neutral process to adjudicate facts is “weaponized against an accuser,” and she reminds us that nothing about this process treated the woman as anything other than instrumental, and that nothing about this process was “fair” or “neutral.”  When she received a Mirror Award this summer for her reporting on Charlie Rose, my colleague Irin Carmon said this in her speech: “The stories that we have been doing are about a system. The system has lawyers and a good reputation. It has publicists. It has a perfectly reasonable explanation about what happened. It has powerful friends that will ask if it’s really worth ruining the career of a good man based on what one women says, what four women say, what 35 women say. Indeed, the system is sitting in this room. Some more than others. The system is still powerful men getting stories killed that I believe will one day see the light of day.”
        
          The system made certain that whatever this woman had to say, or didn’t have to say, would be evaluated by people with partial information and an agenda, even if she didn’t want to share it in the first place. The system is still sitting in this room. The system kind of is this room. The system keeps asking why women in trauma didn’t come forward earlier or later or publicly or privately or anonymously or with evidence or without evidence. The system is why women don’t talk, and even when they do, why things don’t change.

          Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who secured a limited FBI background investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh but voted for him after the curtailed investigation appeared to have largely revisited already publicly known information, told the hosts of ABC’s The View on Tuesday that he was not sure if he believed Kavanaugh’s denials of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford.
        
          “You know, she was very compelling,” Flake said. “He was very persuasive. I don’t know. I don’t know. I wish I had the certitude that some of my colleagues expressed. But I said on the floor before that hearing, we’re likely to leave the hearing with as much doubt as certainty. And that’s how I felt afterwards.”
        
          “Did you believe Dr. Blasey Ford’s testimony under oath before the committee?” The View’s Sunny Hostin asked directly.
        
          Later, Hostin revisited her question: “So you didn’t believe her?”
        
          “No, I don’t know. I don’t know,” Flake answered. “I don’t know if I believed him either.”
        
          When two of the hosts pressed him on why he would vote for someone he had doubts about rather than choose a different candidate, he said the question represented a valid position but countered: “If the mere allegation with no corroboration is sufficient to disqualify someone, we’ve entered a new phase that we probably don’t want to enter.”
        
          Flake also said that while he had wanted “a broader investigation that started sooner,” he thought the FBI investigation had been “thorough” and informative. “I wish that the country could have read that report,” he said.
        
          Flake was also asked about the women who confronted him in an elevator before he decided to demand an FBI investigation with their stories of having been assaulted. “That was powerful,” he said. “And it was effective, too. I was unsettled about the process, I felt that we should have done an FBI investigation. And that reaffirmed it, believe me.” He added that friends and family members called him “throughout this process” to tell him about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault.
        
          Flake joined 49 other senators in voting to confirm Kavanaugh on Oct. 6.

          Sen. Susan Collins’ Friday speech announcing her decision to support Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the Supreme Court revealed that her vote had never really been in doubt. The Republican senator declared herself undecided until the last possible minute, but it now appears that this very public ambivalence was a charade. Collins’ address started as a bad-faith attack on Democrats, then transformed into an astoundingly naïve defense of Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence. It concluded with a condescending sop to Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, suggesting that she’d misidentified her alleged assailant. The speech might as well have been written by Mitch McConnell and Ed Whelan. It was an embarrassment and a travesty.
        
          Collins began in full own-the-libs mode, condemning the “special interest groups” that “raced” to oppose Kavanaugh. This criticism is astonishingly hypocritical. Anti-Kavanaugh organizations have been consistently outspent by pro-Kavanaugh forces—particularly the Judicial Crisis Network, a dark-money group funded largely by a single anonymous donor. JCN spent more than $12 million boosting Kavanaugh, far outpacing Demand Justice’s $5 million anti-Kavanaugh push. Moreover, JCN pioneered the kind of “special interest” campaign for Supreme Court justices that Collins bemoaned. It spent $10 million promoting Justice Neil Gorsuch, and $7 million opposing Merrick Garland. Liberal groups like Demand Justice were formed to counteract JCN, and they haven’t (yet) resorted to the smear tactics for which JCN is notorious.
        
          Then Collins asserted that these “special interest groups whipped their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record.” Her implication was that the thousands of Americans who have written, called, and pleaded with their senators to vote against Kavanaugh were misled sheep responding to propaganda. Collins essentially disparaged her constituents on the Senate floor, portraying them as gullible fools.
        
          It was an ironic critique given that Collins proceeded to reel off talking points about Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence that reflected a profound misunderstanding of the law. First, she suggested that Kavanaugh is some kind of judicial minimalist—that he has “argued for severing” an unconstitutional provision of legislation “as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact.” In reality, Kavanaugh wrote that Supreme Court precedent says that when a law gives an executive agency too much independence from the president, that independence must be severed. That’s it—Kavanaugh was quoting SCOTUS in a highly specific and technical area of the law. Once on the Supreme Court, he may well agree with Justice Clarence Thomas that, when one part of a law is unconstitutional, the whole act must be struck down.
        
          Later, Collins insisted that Kavanaugh struck a compromise in a case challenging Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate. She said he “incurred the disfavor of both sides of the political spectrum” by “seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections.” And though “his critics frequently overlook this point,” Collins declared, Kavanaugh “wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in facilitating access to birth control.”
        
          It appears that Collins totally misunderstands this case, Priests for Life v. HHS. What Kavanaugh actually said is that the government could not require religious employers to sign a form announcing their opposition to birth control so that a third party could provide it instead. It was not a compromise at all; in fact, it evinced profound hostility to the contraception mandate. Collins’ fixation on his “compelling interest” language is asinine.Kavanaugh merely acknowledged that, in Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court “strongly suggests” that birth control access is a “compelling interest.” He then asserted that the mandate did not provide the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest and must therefore be blocked. Religious conservatives did not “disfavor” his opinion. Rather, it gave them everything they wanted, subverting employees’ access to contraception. Collins’ claim to the contrary is a fantasy.
        
          Then there is Collins’ insistence that Kavanaugh follows precedent and would therefore refrain from overturning Roe v. Wade. He believes, she said, that precedent is “not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked.” How, then, does she explain Kavanaugh’s opinion in Garza v. Hargan? In that case, the Trump administration barred an undocumented minor in federal custody from obtaining an abortion even though she had already received judicial bypass from a judge, as required by state law. Kavanaugh wrote that this flat ban was perfectly constitutional, because the Supreme Court has not granted minors a right to “immediate abortion on demand.”
        
          That’s true, as far as it goes: The Supreme Court has ruled that states may force minors to get their parents’ consent before terminating a pregnancy or, if that’s impossible, to obtain a judicial bypass. It has not, however, authorized additional restraints on minors, like the ones imposed by the Trump administration. How did Kavanaugh contend with these precedents, which clearly establish the maximum obstacles the government can place before minors seeking an abortion? He ignored them. Kavanaugh willfully “overlooked” precedent to reach an anti-abortion ruling, illustrating exactly how he’ll gut Roe once he joins the Supreme Court.
        
          The rest of Collins’ speech was an insult to Americans’ intelligence. She pointed out that Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter were appointed by Republicans but voted to uphold Roe. That’s correct, and it’s why the Republican legal establishment’s refrain is “No More Souters.” It’s why the Federalist Society created a network of conservative lawyers unified by their opposition to Roe. It’s why Donald Trump, who campaigned on overturning Roe, outsourced judicial nominations to the Federalist Society. And it’s why Kavanaugh, a Federalist Society loyalist, was selected for this seat.
        
          Collins concluded by delivering a modified Ed Whelan defense of Kavanaugh, stating that Ford must have been assaulted by somebody else. It was a perfectly disingenuous capstone to her dishonest speech. The senator said nothing revealing or insightful on Friday. Collins praised her allies, discredited her opponents, and dismissed the concerns of her constituents. She did not sound like a statesperson carefully weighing a crucial decision. She sounded like a partisan hack.

          Did Brett Kavanaugh drink a lot as a teenager? Is he lying about what he did while drunk? Should senators take that into account when voting on his confirmation to the Supreme Court? The answers to these questions are yes, yes, and yes.
        
          There’s been a lot of indignation on the right, including from Kavanaugh, over questions about his drinking and what they have to do with his merits as a judge. Republicans think that Democrats, having failed to prove that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in 1982, are “moving the goalposts“ to attack his personal habits. But Kavanaugh’s behavior around alcohol is central, not just to Ford’s story but also to Kavanaugh’s reliability as a narrator of his own conduct. And there’s increasing evidence that either he’s hiding what he did or he doesn’t remember.
        
          A lot of news has come out in the past week about Kavanaugh’s drinking. Here’s how it fits together.
        
          1. If Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were drunk on the day that Ford claims they sexually assaulted her, their denials become less credible. If you don’t recall doing something, it’s possible that you didn’t do it. But it’s also possible that you did it and forgot about it. Lots of evidence from science and policing shows that heavy drinking significantly increases the probability of the latter scenario. According to Ford, the boys seemed to think what they were doing was sexual fun, not violence. That adds to the probability that while it was traumatic for her, it wasn’t particularly memorable for them.
        
          2. There’s eyewitness testimony that Kavanaugh and Judge were drunk that day. The eyewitness is Ford. In a letter, an interview, and testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she said Judge and Kavanaugh were “extremely inebriated“ and “stumbling drunk.” Ford said Kavanaugh was so intoxicated that he couldn’t get her clothes off. You could speculate that she’s mistaken or lying. But then you’d have to explain why she told the same story about “two drunken boys” six years ago, before Kavanaugh was on deck for the Supreme Court.
        
          3. There’s corroborating evidence that Kavanaugh and Judge drank a lot. This isn’t evidence of assault, and it isn’t particular to the day in question. But it adds credibility to Ford’s claim that the two boys were drunk. In Judge’s case, the evidence is his alcoholic memoirs. In Kavanaugh’s case, the evidence includes his high school yearbook entry (“Keg City Club,” “100 Kegs or Bust,” “Beach Week Ralph Club”) and his tales about getting hammered in law school. In addition, “nearly a dozen people who knew him well or socialized with him” have told the New York Times that Kavanaugh “was a heavy drinker in college.” Classmates describe him as “slurring his words, stumbling,” “staggering,” and “frequently, incoherently drunk.” High school classmates also suggest that Kavanaugh drank more than he admits. And Kavanaugh’s 1982 calendar shows that on a weekday during the time frame of the alleged assault, he and Judge gathered with friends to drink beer in a setting much like the one Ford describes.
        
          4. There’s corroborating evidence that Judge behaved aggressively toward women while drunk—and then forgot about it. Judge said he doesn’t recall the incident Ford has described. Kavanaugh said this shows both men are innocent. But when you consider Judge’s statement in the context of his history with alcohol, it suggests just the opposite: Judge may have forgotten his encounter with Ford. And that raises the possibility that his drinking buddy Kavanaugh may have done the same.
        
          In his memoirs, Judge recalls that immediately after a wedding celebration, a friend said that Judge had “tried to make it with one of the bridesmaids.” Judge, who had no memory of the incident, pleaded with his friend: “Please tell me I didn’t hurt her.” In another case, Judge woke up from a blackout, thinking, “I could have done anything and not know it—I could have murdered somebody.” Judge confesses that when he drank, “It was as though there was a different version of myself—Mr. Hyde—who had taken over my body, and I couldn’t stop him.”
        
          Together, these facts establish a basis to investigate whether Kavanaugh too behaved aggressively while drunk and forgot about it. Such questions aren’t idle, prurient, or a “fishing expedition.” They’re grounded in evidence particular to Kavanaugh and Judge, and they’re central to evaluating Kavanaugh’s reliability as a witness to his own innocence. So let’s consider the next two points, regarding Kavanaugh’s testimony about his conduct under the influence of alcohol.
        
          5. Kavanaugh denies ever behaving aggressively while drinking. In last week’s hearing, Sen. Chris Coons asked Kavanaugh “whether you’ve ever gotten aggressive while drinking.” Kavanaugh replied, “I think the answer to that is basically no.” He pressed Coons for details—“What are you talking about?”—and went on: “ ‘No’ is the basic answer, unless you’re talking about something where—that I’m not aware of, that you’re going to ask about.” Kavanaugh seemed hesitant, leaving open the possibility that Coons might know of an incident Kavanaugh couldn’t recall. Nevertheless, Kavanaugh chose to say no.
        
          6. Kavanaugh denies having forgotten anything that happened while he was drinking. In the hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, “Was there ever a time when you drank so much that you couldn’t remember what happened, or part of what happened, the night before? Kavanaugh replied: “No. I remember what happened.” Sen. Cory Booker followed up, asking Kavanaugh, “You said you never had gaps in memories. Never had any losses whatsoever. Never had foggy recollection about what happened. Is that correct, sir?” Kavanaugh replied, “That’s what I said.”
        
          In giving these answers under oath, Kavanaugh gambled that nobody would produce evidence to the contrary. Perhaps he thought this wager was necessary in order to maintain his firm denial of what Ford alleges. But the bet hasn’t paid off. Here’s what we have learned in recent days.
        
          7. Evidence shows Kavanaugh behaved aggressively while drinking. James Roche, Kavanaugh’s freshman roommate at Yale—that’s about a year after the alleged assault on Ford—said Kavanaugh “became aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk.” Chad Ludington, another classmate, reports the same observation. According to the Times, “Several Yale classmates recounted an incident” in which Kavanaugh, “after a bout of drinking … tried to break into the enclosed back of a pickup truck belonging to one of them, and later refused to apologize or repair the damage.” Another classmate, Lynne Brookes, describes a party at which Kavanaugh and his friend Chris Dudley got “very drunk” and decided “to barge into a room where a guy and girl had gone off together and embarrass that woman. … [T]hey thought it was funny. The girl was mortified.” This comic attitude echoes Ford’s story about Kavanaugh and Judge laughing as they humiliated her.
        
          In addition to these accounts, a police report says that in 1985, Kavanaugh and Dudley were involved in a bar fight that sent a man to the hospital. One witness said Kavanaugh started the fight by throwing ice. Another said Dudley threw a glass, apparently causing a bloody injury. The report, outlined in the Times by Ben Protess and my longtime Slate colleague Emily Bazelon, says that when Kavanaugh was questioned by officers, he declined “to say if he threw the ice or not.” Ludington, who was present, said Kavanaugh started the fight by “throwing his beer in the man’s face.” Dudley, by the way, is the friend whom Kavanaugh recommended to the Judiciary Committee as a witness to Kavanaugh’s moderation in consuming alcohol.
        
          8. Evidence indicates that Kavanaugh forgot what happened while he was drinking. Several eyewitnesses endorse this conclusion. Brookes said she “drank to excess many nights with Brett Kavanaugh.” She said that he “often drank to excess,” that she saw him “stumbling drunk in a ridiculous costume saying really dumb things,” and that “there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember.” Another classmate, Liz Swisher, said, “I saw him very drunk many times, and there is no way he remembers everything about every night.” Swisher concluded that “it’s not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess.”
        
          Ludington said that “in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking, and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking, Brett has not told the truth.” Another classmate, Kit Winter, said, “I have thought a lot about Kavanaugh’s statement on Fox [News], that he never drank so much that he didn’t remember what he had done the next morning. And having witnessed the level of drunkenness of Brett and his crew … I find that very hard to believe.” An anonymous college friend, speaking to BuzzFeed News, said she had “frequently been drunk with” Kavanaugh and that “he could often be found slumped over, asleep, during and after parties.”
        
          Judge’s and Kavanaugh’s writings support these accounts. In his memoir, Judge depicts a character named Bart O’Kavanaugh who “passed out on his way back from a party.” In his yearbook entry, Kavanaugh jokes about sporting events he watched at parties: “Who Won That Game Anyway? … Who Won Anyway?” And four years ago, Kavanaugh described himself and a former classmate “piecing things together“ to figure out that they’d “had more than a few beers” before an alcohol-soaked banquet in law school.
        
          Then there’s the exchange with Coons in last week’s hearing. It was one of the least-noticed moments in Kavanaugh’s testimony, but it may have been the most telling. The question was whether Kavanaugh had “ever gotten aggressive while drinking.” He could have said yes. He could have said that he had once thrown ice or beer at a guy or that he had once tried to break into a pickup truck. Instead he said no, and he fished for clues. “What are you talking about?” he asked Coons. “… Unless you’re talking about something … that I’m not aware of.”
        
          What was going on in that exchange? There are three possibilities. One is that all the evidence of Kavanaugh’s aggressive behavior—the police report, Ludington’s eyewitness account, and the story told by classmates about the pickup truck—is bogus. The second possibility is that Kavanaugh remembered these incidents but chose to pretend they had never happened. The third possibility is that he didn’t acknowledge them because he didn’t remember them. He forgot what he had done, or he tried to hide it.
        
          That makes it highly plausible that Kavanaugh has done the same with the drunken assault on Ford: If he isn’t falsely denying it, he has forgotten it. The evidence of Kavanaugh’s drinking, aggression, and denial doesn’t prove this conclusion, but it makes it far more plausible than it would be for a random innocent man. Too plausible to put Kavanaugh on the nation’s highest court.

          Donald Trump introduced Brett Kavanaugh to the American public on July 9 at the White House. The same day, 40 evangelical leaders issued a statement praising Trump’s nominee for lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. The signatories were led by Southern Baptist policy head and frequent Trump critic Russell Moore and included the denomination’s new president, pastors, and the heads of various educational institutions and high-profile nonprofits. Kavanaugh “merits appointment as the next associate justice on the United States Supreme Court,” the statement read. “We support President Trump’s nominee and will pray and work for a quick confirmation process.”
        
          To say that Christian conservatives supported the Kavanaugh nomination does not go far enough in capturing their enthusiasm. It wasn’t just that Kavanaugh was a solid pick—reliably conservative, with a record of skepticism on Roe v. Wade—but that the nomination was a kind of payoff. “It is, of course, the reason why so many evangelicals supported Trump in the presidential election,” Karen Swallow Prior, an English professor at Liberty University, told NPR in early September. Prior did not vote for Trump, but she signed the letter of support for Kavanaugh. “We believe that he will interpret the Constitution more faithfully than activist judges in the past,” she told NPR. “And so yes, that does give us some confidence that he would uphold the dignity of human life—of all human life.” Georgia pastor Jentezen Franklin, a member of Trump’s evangelical advisory board, told the Washington Post in July that the promise of a nominee like Kavanaugh “drove millions and millions of evangelicals, more than any other issue, to the polls for Donald Trump.”
        
          In recent days, however, many of Kavanaugh’s Christian supporters have gone silent. On Sunday, the Washington Post published a deeply reported interview with a woman who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were both in high school. Christine Blasey Ford, now a psychology professor in California, said that the attack occurred when she and Kavanaugh were at the same house party in the early 1980s. She was 15, and he was 17. Kavanaugh and a friend were both “stumbling drunk,” and they got her alone in a bedroom, where Kavanaugh pinned her down, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford told the Post. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” She was able to escape and fled the house.
        
          Rumblings of trouble for Kavanaugh began last week, when the Intercept reported that Sen. Dianne Feinstein was in possession of a letter that included details of an unspecified accusation against him. Other details—though not Ford’s name—emerged over the next few days. On Friday, the White House issued a statement on the nominee’s behalf, saying he “categorically and unequivocally” denied the allegation. On Monday, reports indicated that Ford and Kavanaugh will both testify in front of the Senate next Monday.
        
          For all the prominent Christian supporters Kavanaugh amassed on the day of his nomination, few of them have weighed in on the accusation against him, even as his confirmation hearings and Ford’s account have dominated headlines over the past week. A few have spoken up on Kavanaugh’s behalf, including the CEO of Catholic Charities, who has known the nominee since childhood and said: “He’s never given me any reason to doubt his veracity and character.” Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, wrote a Facebook post slamming Ford’s “uncorroborated 36-year-old high school allegation” as a “disgraceful, partisan debasement of the U.S. Senate and the confirmation process.” Evangelist and Trump supporter Franklin Graham tweeted that none of Kavanaugh’s FBI vettings had turned up the “36-year-old allegations,” and that the show must go on.
        
          Other members of the religious right have offered a different argument, one that’s been echoed by many conservatives: Sure, Kavanaugh may have done it, but it was such a long time ago that he cannot reasonably be held accountable for it. Rod Dreher, a conservative writer, mused that Kavanaugh’s “loutish drunken behavior” has nothing to tell us about his current character:
        
          But these scattered voices testing out varied defenses of Kavanaugh are the exception. Many more of Kavanaugh’s conservative Christian supporters have so far been silent, apparently content to wait and see. Starting on Monday evening, I reached out to about a dozen prominent evangelicals who publicly supported Kavanaugh immediately after the announcement in July. Franklin Graham’s representative pointed me to his online statement. But only one other person made time to weigh in. “I don’t expect we will ever know the truth about what did or did not happen,” Karen Swallow Prior told me. “But as an evangelical Christian, I am convinced Dante himself could not have devised a more fitting circle of hell for my faith community than the one in which we find ourselves: being destroyed from the inside out by the sexual sin we spent decades pointing out everywhere but in our own house. For us, this is the real trial.”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/leaked-email-shows-kavanaugh-questioned-whether-roe-v-wade-is-settled-law.html,"
          In a dramatic moment on Thursday morning, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker announced that he would release previously secret documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s time in the White House Counsel’s office under George W. Bush. The documents reveal Kavanaugh’s skepticism toward the description of Roe v. Wade as “settled law”—even though the nominee said on Wednesday that Roe was “settled as precedent.” They also indicate Kavanaugh’s hostility toward affirmative action programs, condemning a race-conscious federal regulation as a “naked racial set-aside.”
        
          Under Senate rules, Booker is not permitted to release the documents, which are marked “committee confidential,” to the full chamber or the public. They received that designation from William Burck, a Republican attorney who previously worked for Kavanaugh and now represents current White House Counsel Don McGahn. Because Republicans rushed these hearings before the National Archives could complete its review, Burck has been tasked with choosing which documents from Kavanaugh’s White House tenure may be disclosed. But Booker flouted Burck’s restrictions on Thursday, with the support of his Democratic colleagues, daring Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, to “expel him.”
        
          Moments after Booker’s revelation, the New York Times published several emails that Kavanaugh wrote during his years in the White House Counsel’s office involving abortion, affirmative action, warrantless surveillance, and campaign finance laws. In one email, written in March 2003, Kavanaugh proposed deleting a line from a draft op-ed which stated that “it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.” Kavanaugh disagreed with that line. “I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level,” he wrote, “since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.” (At the time, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, as well as Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, had expressed a clear desire to reverse Roe.)
        
          As a factual matter, this statement is certainly correct. But it casts doubt on the candor of Kavanaugh’s earlier testimony before the committee. When Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked Kavanaugh about Roe on Wednesday, he told her: “It’s settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis.” That, too, is true—but clearly Kavanaugh has more nuanced thoughts about just how “settled” it is, and how much “respect” it deserves. He failed to mention these qualms to the committee. Moreover, Feinstein asked Kavanaugh if his “views about whether Roe is settled precedent changed” since he was “in the Bush White House.” Kavanaugh responded cagily: “I’m not sure what [you’re] referring to about the Bush White House.” Again, the nominee declined to delve into his rather more sophisticated thoughts on Roe as settled law when he worked for a White House dedicated to overturning it.
        
          Elsewhere in the email, Kavanaugh complained about the op-ed’s comparison of a Bush nominee to Justice David Souter, a Republican appointee who drifted left. The piece should not “imply that she is another Souter,” Kavanaugh wrote, using common shorthand for Republican judicial nominees who refuse to cleave to the GOP platform.
        
          In another leaked email from 2001, Kavanaugh corresponded with a Justice Department attorney about the constitutionality of the warrantless surveillance of phone and email conversation of non-citizens in the United States. Yet he testified in 2006 that he had never seen or heard anything about the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program until it leaked to the press. In a 2001 email, Kavanaugh harshly criticized proposed Department of Transportation regulations that would benefit minority-owned businesses, dismissing them as “a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside.” And in a 2003 email, Kavanaugh condemned a lower court for upholding a law that barred corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to pay for ads attacking or supporting a candidate for federal office.
        
          The decision, Kavanaugh wrote, was “both strange and dangerous.” He hoped the Supreme Court would “not care” and reverse it, expecting either Rehnquist or Justice Sandra Day O’Connor to be the swing vote. In the end, O’Connor did cast the fifth vote to uphold the limitations. But the Supreme Court reversed her decision after Justice Samuel Alito replaced her. In the end, these documents don’t tell us anything we don’t already know about Kavanaugh. If confirmed, he will vote to overturn Roe, abolish affirmative action, uphold mass digital surveillance, and scrap what’s left of campaign finance limits. It remains an open question whether Democrats were wise to fixate on the suppression of these documents rather than zero in on Kavanaugh’s contentious conservative views, most of which are already on record. But at a minimum, the leaked emails further confirm what senators like Susan Collins are attempting to deny: Kavanaugh is a locked-in vote to effectuate the GOP agenda on day one.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-calendar-for-july-1-1982-go-to-timmys-for-skis-with-judge.html,"
          Much of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony Tuesday focused on calendars he kept in the summer of 1982, where he detailed a few months that consisted mostly of hanging out with friends and sports camps and, Kavanaugh pointed out, few weekends spent in the Washington area as he traveled to the beach and other summer destinations. He insisted that his calendars proved he could not have been present at a gathering like the one described by accuser Christine Blasey Ford—a small group of friends drinking at a house when no parents were home.* Kavanaugh maintained that he recorded all his social engagements and that no entry on his calendar matches the vague outlines of the get-together Ford detailed. But one entry shows that he went “to Timmy’s for skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi.”
        
          Ford had identified Mark Judge as in the room while Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her and said that “P.J.”—a man named Patrick Smyth—was elsewhere at the gathering. (Smyth denied to the Judiciary Committee being present at any such gathering.) Ford also noted that it appeared that Judge and Kavanaugh had been drinking beforehand and were far more intoxicated than the other people there.
        
          In Thursday’s hearing, Kavanaugh was asked about the July 1 entry by Rachel Mitchell, the lawyer representing Republican senators, and replied, “It looks like we went over to Timmy’s” and identified the other boys who’d joined him. That was as far as that line of questioning went.
        
          July 1 was a Thursday. Kavanaugh’s defense also relied on his insistence that the gathering could not have happened on a weeknight. “The event described by Dr. Ford presumably happened on a weekend because I believe everyone worked and had jobs in the summers,” he said. Kavanaugh later said his summer job in 1982 was mowing lawns. (“I had my own business of sorts.”)
        
          Speaking of summer jobs, a book written by Judge says that the summer before his senior year of high school, “to raise money for football camp, I spent a few weeks working as a bag boy at the local supermarket.” This supports another statement of Ford’s when she described seeing Judge after the alleged incident at his job at a local Safeway supermarket. Judge writes in his book that, by then, he was “completely hooked” on alcohol and was frequently drunk. “Invariably I would be hungover” while working there, he wrote, which would mean drinking on weeknights.
        
          Is it possible that teenagers might gather to drink on a Thursday night in the summer at a house with no parents home? Is it possible Kavanaugh went over to Timmy’s for “skis” (brewskis, apparently) and he and Judge journeyed on to another gathering? Could the night of July 1 be the night Ford was assaulted? Sounds worthy of further interrogation.

          In a few weeks, the Senate will likely confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he will serve a lifetime appointment. A few years after he joins the bench—or as early as next June—Kavanaugh will cast the decisive vote in a 5–4 decision that will eviscerate Roe v. Wade. Within hours, days, and weeks of that ruling, a slew of states will outlaw or severely limit abortion; others will resume enforcing abortion bans that remain on the books. None of this is hypothetical or seriously debatable. The American conservative movement has spent decades waiting for this exact moment. Now that it has arrived, they are determined not to miss their opportunity—and by all indications, they will not. Republicans are on the brink of achieving their long sought-after goal of abolishing the constitutional right to abortion access.
        
          It is not surprising that conservatives have perfectly executed their well-laid plan to reverse Roe. What is remarkable, however, is how little resistance they have faced from progressives. While a majority of Democratic senators have already voiced their hostility to Kavanaugh, their base has utterly failed to mount a vigorous, sustained opposition to his nomination. If, today, liberals could channel a fraction of the outrage they will feel after Kavanaugh overturns Roe, they would have a shot at keeping him off the court. Instead, their relative apathy toward his impending confirmation has likely doomed reproductive rights for at least a generation.
        
          Kavanaugh has not been particularly subtle about his distaste for Roe and its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In his current job on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh attempted to manipulate these precedents in order to prevent an undocumented immigrant minor from terminating her pregnancy. Under Casey, the government cannot impose an “undue burden” on a woman seeking an abortion before viability. Yet the Trump administration had imposed a flat ban on abortion for undocumented minors in federally funded shelters. (It maintained that minors who wished to terminate their pregnancies should either find a sponsor in the U.S.—a near impossible task for many without family here—or leave the country.) Kavanaugh held that this position did not constitute an undue burden, in a ruling which would have forced “Jane Doe,” a 17-year-old who was already 15 weeks pregnant, to continue her unwanted pregnancy.
        
          The full D.C. Circuit swiftly overturned Kavanaugh’s ruling and granted Doe access to abortion. In response, Kavanaugh penned a furious dissent that brimmed over with anti-abortion rhetoric. The majority, he sneered, had granted Doe “abortion on demand”—a phrase that, as Irin Carmon notes, is deployed by the right to “denote women capriciously making decisions for themselves.” He claimed that Doe was not mature enough to make this “major life decision” on her own, even though she had already received the necessary judicial bypass from a state court. And he asserted, incredibly, that the Trump administration was being unlawfully forced to “facilitate” Doe’s abortion by merely stepping aside and letting her obtain it. (This argument is fundamentally theological, not legal.)
        
          Kavanaugh’s dissent lays out a road map for the reversal of Roe and Casey. If the Trump administration’s outright ban on abortion for immigrant minors does not constitute an “undue burden,” then nothing does. And Kavanaugh knows it. The judge seized upon the case to signal his discontent with Casey and offer a glimpse into how he’d go about reversing the decision. Once he is on the Supreme Court, he can chip away at precedent by upholding a variety of abortion restrictions, insisting that they are not an “undue burden.” And once the court has eroded Casey to the point of nullity, it can finally overturn it outright.
        
          On its own, Kavanaugh’s approach to the Jane Doe case is enough to prove his anti-abortion, anti-Roe bona fides. But if that doesn’t convince you, consider his 2017 address to the American Enterprise Institute—the speech that seems to have bumped him to the top of Donald Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist. During his address, Kavanaugh took gratuitous swipes at Roe, praising then-Justice William Rehnquist’s dissent and disparaging the doctrinal foundation of Roe’s constitutional holding. His lavish praise for Rehnquist’s anti-abortion dissent sent a clear message to Trump and his advisers: Put me on the Supreme Court, and you can trust me to overturn Roe when the time comes. 
        
          All of this is on the public record. And yet the Democratic base has not treated Kavanaugh’s confirmation like the emergency that it is. There is none of the urgency that surrounded Congress’ botched repeal of the Affordable Care Act. There is little of the rage that greeted controversial Trump nominees like Betsy DeVos. Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the only Republican senators who stand a chance of opposing Kavanaugh, have said that they do not feel significant pressure from their constituents to vote against him. There is “a different level of intensity,” Murkowski explained in July. The confirmation vote is simply too abstract, too impersonal to ignite the passions of last summer. There is no sit-in movement, no mass outpouring of fear and frustration. Activists seem to have devoted relatively little time and money to shoring up red-state Democrats’ opposition to Kavanaugh. And it seems that they’ve barely bothered to appeal to the rest of the Republican caucus.
        
          If the Senate were currently on the brink of passing a bill that would ban abortion in much of the country, progressives would surely be swarming every congressional office—even those of conservative Republicans. Confirming Kavanaugh will have roughly the same effect, yet only a tiny fraction of the country seems especially upset about it. Roe is popular among Democrats and Republicans, and when it goes, Americans will take to the streets en masse. Their anger will snowball once they see the grim reality of abortion bans—the women arrested and imprisoned for exerting control over their bodies. For now, though, they are watching the disaster unfold in slow motion, and few seem moved to even call their senators.
        
          There is little mystery to how all this ends. The modern Republican Party is built upon a conviction that Roe is illegitimate. Kavanaugh is a GOP apparatchik who has vocally endorsed the anti-abortion party line. Once he is in the Supreme Court, he will do precisely what his party asks of him and gut the constitutional right to abortion access. Progressives had a brief shot at stopping him and saving Roe. They blew it.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-elite-power.html,"
          What’s striking about the many defenses of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a credible accusation of sexual assault when he was a teenager is how they put broad concerns over accountability and impunity into sharp relief. Calls for leniency and understanding for the judge before courts of power and opinion that may determine his career sit uncomfortably next to the treatment of young black Americans at the hands of police, or of unauthorized immigrants at the hands of border authorities.
        
          Watching the machinery of elite power operate on behalf of Kavanaugh is both a lesson in who is entitled to second chances and absolution as well as an illustration of larger conflicts over the limits and boundaries of accountability. And read in that light, Kavanaugh is the perfect vessel for a view that puts the most privileged and powerful beyond the reach of public account.
        
          The allegation is straightforward. Christine Blasey Ford says that at 15, while attending a house party, a 17-year-old Brett Kavanaugh pinned her down and tried to remove her clothing, stifling her screams with his hand while playing loud music to muffle the sounds. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” she told the Washington Post, giving full details in an interview after contacting the paper after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court and Kavanaugh was a potential nominee. Now a 51-year-old research psychologist at Palo Alto University, Ford says the incident burdened her teen years. “I think it derailed me substantially for four or five years,” she said.
        
          Kavanaugh denies the allegation. “This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone,” he said in a statement released Monday. The Senate Judiciary Committee has set a hearing for the accusation; according to the New York Times, Ford has yet to confirm her appearance.
        
          Republican leaders have not budged from their support. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Kavanaugh is a “great gentleman” and “not a man who deserves this.” On Monday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley questioned the timing of the revelation in a statement to the press. “It raises a lot of questions about Democrats’ tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committee’s attention only now rather than during these many steps along the way,” the statement reads.
        
          Conservative media also leapt to Kavanaugh’s defense. “A single sourced, uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago never mentioned to anyone until the alleged perp is a public figure is not a credible accusation,” wrote conservative pundit Erick Erickson on Twitter, neglecting documentation that Ford told her therapist in 2012. Where Erickson denies the allegations, American Conservative writer Rod Dreher accepts them but characterizes the incident in benign terms. “I do not understand why the loutish drunken behavior of a 17 year old high school boy has anything to tell us about the character of a 53 year old judge,” he said on Twitter. “By God’s grace (literally), I am not the same person I was at 17. This is a terrible standard to establish in public life.” On Fox News, former Bush administration press secretary Ari Fleischer asked, “How accountable are we for high school actions,” also asking whether incidents like the alleged assault should “deny us chances later in life?”
        
          If Kavanaugh confirmed Ford’s account, or expressed contrition for any intoxicated behavior, then there would be legitimate questions of culpability—what is the responsibility of a middle-age man to the actions of his teenage self? But Kavanaugh denies the incident in full, from the assault itself to his presence at the party in question. Like Erickson’s brief in his favor, his defense is this never happened, which makes his accuser a liar. The stakes of a hearing then are not just about his past behavior, but about his present character. And if he’s not telling the truth, then we’ve learned Brett Kavanaugh will do or say anything to secure his political ascent.
        
          But would Republicans and their conservative allies hold him to account? The best evidence says no.
        
          What we’ve seen in the age of Trump is the complete collapse of standards for behavior and conduct among Republicans. The obvious example is the president himself, who in 2016 faced more than a dozen accusations of sexual assault after bragging, on camera, about kissing and groping women without their consent. Vocal disgust from Republican leaders eventually gave way to quiet acquiescence, as they rationalized Trump’s behavior as the necessary price of victory, and later, as the cost of achieving key goals—including a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.
        
          From the vantage point of 2018, that bargain looks like the original sin of the Trump era, a moment of moral weakness heralding a cascade of moral failure. When Roy Moore faced credible accusations of child molestation, Republicans momentarily broke with his campaign before restoring support in the weeks before voting. Mitch McConnell could tolerate abuse of minors by a political fellow-traveler if it meant a vote for his Senate caucus. When Trump was accused of making potentially illegal payments to cover up a sexual relationship with an adult film actress, his supporters on the evangelical right simply shrugged. “We kind of gave him—‘All right, you get a mulligan. You get a do-over here,’ ” said Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, a conservative activist group. And when former wrestlers at Ohio State University accused Rep. Jim Jordan of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse in the athletic program when he was assistant coach of the university’s wrestling team, prominent conservatives like Ginni Thomas—wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas—came to his defense. “Jim Jordan is under attack, with false accusations, because he threatens the elite,” she wrote on her Facebook page.
        
          The defense of Kavanaugh—including outright dismissal of claims against him—is of a piece with the pattern established when the Republican Party grafted itself to the Trump Organization. It’s not insignificant that Kavanaugh’s first statement as a Supreme Court nominee was a blatant falsehood in praise of the president: “No president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination,” he said, despite clear evidence that Trump picked his name from a pre-determined list of candidates.
        
          There is a flip side to the endless extension of moral credit to powerful (white) men like Trump or Moore or even Kavanaugh. It is its denial to those born on a lower caste.
        
          The same Rod Dreher who pleads sympathy for Kavanaugh had far less compassion for Michael Brown, killed in Ferguson, Missouri, during a confrontation with Officer Darren Wilson in 2014. In a piece titled “Tips for Not Getting Shot by Cops,” Dreher cautioned future young black men not to “be a lawbreaker or hang out with lawbreakers,” while raising the possibility that Brown’s death was justified.
        
          Donald Trump’s willingness to look past Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations stands in stark contrast with his approach to the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting a jogger in Central Park in 1989. While they were still just suspects, Trump called for their execution. Decades later, clear evidence of their innocence wasn’t enough to shake Trump of his belief in their guilt. “They admitted they were guilty,” said Trump just a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election. “The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous.”
        
          To look beyond individual pundits and politicians is to see a world where responsibility and culpability is structured by race, class, gender, and your overall proximity to disadvantage. In the existing framework, we cannot ask a prospective Supreme Court justice to account for the actions of his youth, but we can hold a 12-year-old black boy responsible for not heeding police commands fast enough, or a 17-year-old black teenager for not deferring to a neighborhood watchman. Some people escape punishment for the crimes of their youth, others lose their right to vote for life. Right-wing pundits who back deportation for young adults brought to the United States as children also think the accusations against Kavanaugh are a disgrace. Somewhere, a man Kavanaugh’s age is sitting in prison for a crime committed as a teenager.
        
          Much of the past decade of American life has been marked by a crisis of accountability that transcends conventional divisions of party and ideology. The leaders who produced the catastrophic failures of the 2000s—from the Iraq war and an illegal torture regime to the financial crisis and the near-collapse of the global economy—remain elites in good standing, with leading roles in political and economic life. Police kill unarmed men and women—many of them from our most marginalized communities—with virtual impunity, immune to criminal punishment or legal sanction in all but the most egregious cases of misconduct. Even after exposing entrenched patterns of sexual abuse and misconduct, women still fight—with limited and provisional success—to hold men accountable for their actions.
        
          In the immediate post-Trump era Americans will have to deal with the wreckage of his corruption, graft, and disdain for the public trust. They’ll have to grapple with the human consequences of this administration, from the irreparable damage done to migrant parents and children as a result of “family separation” at the border to those families broken and scarred as a result of indiscriminate deportation policies. They’ll have to consider the difference between ordinary politics and the moral transgressions that demand a public account from those responsible.
        
          In other words, the crisis of accountability will continue. The only question is whether we’ll hold the relevant individuals and institutions as liable, or if we’ll again “look forward” and leave elite malfeasance in the past, allowing those responsible to launder their reputations and seek another chance in public life.
        
          This isn’t an abstract concern. Gary Cohn was the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs, part of the machinery that caused the financial crisis. In 2017, he joined the White House as director of the National Economic Council, where he served as chief economic adviser to the president until April. Kirstjen Nielsen was special assistant to the president for prevention, preparedness, and response during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Her team, notes the Washington Post, was “widely criticized for its passive and clumsy response.” She is now secretary of homeland security. As an intelligence officer, Gina Haspel urged destruction of tapes documenting the use of torture on U.S detainees. During her command of a secret base in Thailand, CIA interrogators used waterboarding and other brutal techniques against al-Qaida captives. Haspel is now CIA director.
        
          Kavanaugh is part of this story too. He was associate White House counsel in the George W. Bush administration from 2001 to 2003, a time when other lawyers in the office were crafting memos to justify torture, mass surveillance, and indefinite detention. He then served as staff secretary until 2005. During confirmation hearings for a seat on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee he had no knowledge of those memos or other documents relating to those programs. We now know this was misleading: “In 2002, Kavanaugh and a group of top White House lawyers discussed whether the Supreme Court would uphold the Bush administration’s decision to deny lawyers to American enemy combatants,” reported NPR in 2007. More recently, emails released by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont show Kavanaugh was part of the discussion around President Bush’s warrantless wiretap program as early as September 2001. In his 2006 testimony, Kavanaugh said he only learned of the program in 2005.
        
          Brett Kavanaugh has little personally in common with Donald Trump. He has taken pains, at his nomination announcement and during his confirmation hearings, to assert his woman-friendly bona fides. Nonetheless, he is a perfect nominee for the moment. He embodies the driving themes of the Trump era, albeit in more genteel, traditional form than the president himself. Themes of elite impunity in the face of open transgression; of redemption without recompense for those in authority; and of a society that extends endless opportunity for some and deploys unyielding punishment for others. He is both the product of a political movement devoted to the protection of existing hierarchies of race, gender, and wealth, and a representative of the power structure that sits at the top of those hierarchies.
        
          Most of this was apparent at the time of his nomination. But Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation—and the conservative response—makes it blindingly clear. The question of this age, the fight of this age, is whether people like Kavanaugh—people with wealth and authority, shielded by advantages of race and gender—are citizens to be held accountable, or members of a special caste unbound by rule of law.

          Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, would like to correct a misunderstanding. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday night, Kavanaugh promises to be an impartial justice, not the liberal-baiting flamethrower he played in his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. We’ve seen this from Kavanaugh before: rage, animus, and political warfare, followed by a scramble to clean things up. The cleanup is an act. The real Kavanaugh is what we saw in the committee hearing: a congenital partisan.
        
          In his op-ed, Kavanaugh argues that his angry speech to the committee was a natural response to false accusations of sexual assault:
        
          This explanation has two problems. One is that it accounts for Kavanaugh’s anger but not for the starkly partisan language in which he vented that anger. The second problem is that his tirade at the hearing, unlike his behavior with Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and other women, is on video. We can play it back and check it against his attempts to whitewash it. Here’s what Kavanaugh told the committee on Sept. 27:
        
          That’s seven attacks on Democrats and “the left” in less than two minutes. But Kavanaugh was just getting started:
        
          “Left-wing” groups, “the Clintons,” “anger about President Trump”—the whole diatribe was political. It sounded like Hillary Clinton’s 1998 complaint about a “vast right-wing conspiracy” against her husband—a rant worthy of a politician, not a Supreme Court justice. Kavanaugh’s speech also echoed Clarence Thomas’ opening statement to the Judiciary Committee in 1991, after Thomas was accused of sexual harassment. But in that statement, Thomas never uttered the words “left” or “Democratic.” Kavanaugh used those words 11 times.
        
          Suppose Kavanaugh is innocent of all allegations of sexual misconduct. In that case, he has every right to be angry. He might well respond, in the language of his op-ed, “as a son, husband and dad.” But what does being a son, husband, or dad have to do with “the left” or the Democratic Party? Why would a man who claims that he was thinking about his parents, his wife, and his daughters rail against “the Clintons” and “anger about President Trump”?
        
          Many of Kavanaugh’s supporters say he was right to call out Democrats, since Democrats had attacked his nomination. But there’s a difference between rebuking specific politicians and repeatedly targeting them as a group. When you aim your rhetoric at a group, you reveal something about yourself. Kavanaugh talked about the perfidy of Democrats the way Trump talks about the criminality of immigrants.
        
          This isn’t a one-time outburst. In 1998, while working for independent counsel Ken Starr, Kavanaugh wrote an angry memo against President Clinton. Kavanaugh urged Starr to “make [Clinton’s] pattern of revolting behavior clear—piece by painful piece.” Afterward, according to colleagues, Kavanaugh “immediately regretted” his explosion. Kavanaugh has also behaved violently at least twice after drinking, according to witnesses and a police report. There’s the Kavanaugh who apologizes, and then there’s the Kavanaugh who keeps doing things that require apologies.
        
          Kavanaugh’s partisanship runs deep. He worked for Starr against Clinton. Then he worked for George W. Bush in the Florida recount in 2000. Then he worked for Bush in the White House counsel’s office and as staff secretary. He worked with Republican Senate staffers to use material stolen from Democrats, then claimed he had no idea the material was stolen. As a judge, Kavanaugh keeps finding ways to justify what Republicans want. Sometimes he reins in federal agencies, arguing that Congress gets to make policy. Sometimes he reins in Congress. Sometimes he defers to the president, sometimes he doesn’t. His opinions line up less with judicial principles than with Republican preferences.
        
          Kavanaugh’s written draft of his statement to the Judiciary Committee, submitted on Sept. 26, was nonpartisan. It spoke of “a frenzy to come up with something—anything … that will block a vote on my nomination.” But while Ford was testifying on the morning of Sept. 27, Kavanaugh, by his own account, rewrote his remarks instead of watching her testimony. After the word “frenzy,” he inserted the phrase “on the left.” And before the words “grotesque and obvious character assassination,” he inserted “anger about President Trump,” “revenge on behalf of the Clintons,” and “left-wing opposition groups.” These revisions weren’t the work of a man defending his honor. They were carefully crafted appeals to political tribalism.
        
          Republicans have the votes to put Kavanaugh on the court, disregarding objections to his partisan tirade. By doing so, they would essentially affirm that appointing justices is just another way of using and consolidating power. Democrats, in turn, might respond at their next opportunity by adding another justice or two to the court. If that happens, you’ll have to forgive the overreach by the left. Sometimes people get emotional.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-alex-kozinski-sexual-harassment.html,"
          Last January, Sen. Mazie Hirono announced her intention, in light of the #MeToo movement, to ask every nominee put forward for a federal judgeship about his or her history with sexual harassment and assault. On Wednesday night, the Hawaii Democrat got the opportunity to raise those questions to Brett Kavanaugh, who is currently being vetted for a Supreme Court seat.
        
          Although Hirono did ask Kavanaugh if he had ever sexually assaulted or harassed anyone—the nominee said no—the more pertinent questions centered on what he knew about former 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski, and what he could or could not have done about Kozinski’s behavior. Last December, 15 women came forward to accuse Kozinski of sexual harassment. Some of them clerked for him. Others were law professors, law students, and lawyers. One was a judge. One was Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick, who clerked on the 9th Circuit and recounted how the judge had asked her what she was wearing when she called his chambers. Following the accusations, Kozinski retired, precluding an official investigation into his behavior on the bench. He also released a statement noting that making clerks feel uncomfortable “was never his intent.”
        
          Kavanaugh not only clerked for Kozinski in the early 1990s, he also maintained a long relationship with the judge. In the Cut on Wednesday, Irin Carmon succinctly summarized the professional ties between the two men:
        
          Given what can reasonably be described as their close working relationship, Hirono attempted to assess whether Kavanaugh had ever witnessed or heard about Kozinski’s behavior prior to December. She also followed up on questions posed by Sen. Orrin Hatch about whether Kavanaugh was on a notorious lewd email thread Kozinski ran during his time as a judge.
        
          There are several remarkable things about this exchange. For starters, Hirono refuses to accept the evasive answer Kavanaugh had already given in response to questions about whether he was on Kozinski’s email chain.
        
          If Kavanaugh was not actually on the list, you would imagine he would want to state this plainly for the record. Given that he didn’t state it plainly, it seems plausible that he was on the list and doesn’t want to take any hits for it, so he’s going to go with “I don’t remember.” That’s the phrasing he repeats several times.
        
          In response to questions from Hatch earlier on Wednesday, Kavanaugh described the news of Kozinski’s behavior—which he claims to have learned about only last December despite its extreme pervasiveness—as a “gut punch.” And yet, even when that behavior became public, he did nothing about it. He didn’t speak up then, and he won’t say anything now. His exchange with Hirono makes this point painfully clear.
        
          Kavanaugh’s attempt to argue that he and Kozinski were mere professional acquaintances falls flat in the face of the evidence. “He introduced you to the Senate in your 2006 nomination hearing and he called you his good friend,” Hirono said. “Yesterday, you called each of the people who introduced you a friend and I presume you felt that way about Judge Kozinski when he introduced you in 2006. You joined him for panels at the Federalist Society where you patted him on the shoulder and said, ‘I learned from the master about hiring clerks.’ ”
        
          How could Kavanaugh have maintained such a close relationship with the judge for so many years—years during which abuse and harassment was alleged to have happened—without having any idea that his friend was routinely demeaning his employees and other women in the legal sphere? Slate contributor Rick Hasen says such a thing is essentially impossible:
        
          In response to Hirono’s questioning, Kavanaugh says he would’ve done three things if he’d heard the allegations against Kozinski:
        
          But Kavanaugh didn’t call anyone, because he claimed he didn’t know anything.
        
          Hirono attempted to home in on Kavanaugh’s professions of ignorance, and what they might tell us about how harassment persists. “This is why the #MeToo movement is so important,” she said, “because often in these kinds of situations where there are power issues involved, and certainly there are between judges and clerks, that often, you know, it’s an environment where people ‘See nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.’ And that’s what we have to change.” Kavanaugh’s reply: “I agree with you, senator. I agree completely. There need to be better reporting mechanisms. Women who are the victims of sexual harassment need to know who they can call, when they can call.”
        
          Based on everything we know, Kavanaugh is a man who does not harass or abuse women. Far from it—he is a man, it seems, who actively works to empower women. (For the sake of argument, let’s put aside for a moment his interest in restricting their ability to access reproductive health care.) The majority of his law clerks, it has been noted again and again, were women. All of the women who clerked for him (and whose current positions do not prevent them from speaking publicly) signed on to a letter of support for the judge. He has repeatedly invoked his mother’s career in law as part of his inspiration for working toward gender equity in the legal world. Is this really someone who we want to argue is not a champion of women?
        
          I think it is. You don’t get to be a champion of women if you support some women while turning a blind eye to the sexual harassment your friend perpetuates for decades in his (and your former) workplace. You are a champion of women if you stop harassment. In the days after he heard the Kozinski claims, did Kavanaugh, one of the few people who even had the option of reaching out to the illustrious list of contacts he names, make any of those calls to suggest the judiciary take these women’s claims seriously? Did he urge the judiciary to act? Did he call the women who had spoken out and ask what he could do to help? We have no evidence that he did any of those things.
        
          This is, admittedly, an extremely high bar, but it’s the exact right height for people who are in positions of power. As a federal judge who was part of a pipeline for Supreme Court clerkships, Kavanaugh had this kind of power. And as a nominee to the high court who has positioned himself as a champion of women, he should be held to the highest possible moral standard.
        
          If people in power do nothing after feeling a “gut punch” upon hearing about abuse within their workplaces, nothing will ever be done to remedy harassment. Kozinski got away with harassing women for 30 years because, in basically every case, there was an enormous power differential between him and those women. When Kavanaugh says “women who are the victims of sexual harassment need to know who they can call, when they can call,” I have no idea what he is talking about. Even after the Kozinski revelations have been made public, there still is no good system for clerks to receive clarity on what they can and cannot share, based on the confidentiality rules to which they are still bound.
        
          More broadly, there is no universal hotline we can set up for women to call when they are abused by their bosses. There is a collection of human beings, people who are not abusers and who do not want abuse to happen, who have to perform the function we all wish we could outsource to anyone else. Kavanaugh claims he would have spoken up. It’s a nice sentiment. It’s also an extremely easy one to express once you think there’s nothing left to do.

          The Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have engaged Rachel Mitchell, an experienced sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, to question Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford on Thursday about Ford’s allegations of sexual assault. Presumably the male GOP senators on the committee have chosen a woman to question Ford because they are wary of interrogating an alleged victim of sexual abuse.
        
          But less attention has been paid to what kind of treatment Kavanaugh himself will receive. Just what kinds of questions should Kavanaugh be required to answer about the serious, and now multiple, accusations that have been lodged against him in the last few weeks? During a Sept. 24 appearance on Fox News, Kavanaugh declared that he has “never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever” and has “always treated women with dignity and respect.” He has expressed more than a little annoyance, however, at the prospect that these broad assertions might be tested through a detailed and factual inquiry into his reportedly heavy drinking or his relationships with and treatment of women during his high school, college, and law school years.
        
          During the Fox News interview, Kavanaugh declared, “I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter,” and then stated, “I’ll leave it at that.” According to the Washington Post, Kavanaugh expressed the same view while preparing for Thursday’s hearing and “grew frustrated when it came to questions that dug into his private life, particularly his drinking habits and his sexual proclivities.”
        
          The message seems clear: Kavanaugh considers it improper and unseemly to undertake a searching and potentially embarrassing inquiry into his sexual history and potential abuse of alcohol. Kavanaugh has also suggested that such an inquiry is unnecessary, particularly given that, during high school, he was a model citizen, “focused on academics and athletics, going to church every Sunday at Little Flower, [and] working on my service projects.”
        
          Yet when he was a prosecutor on Ken Starr’s independent counsel staff, Kavanaugh had no such reticence about asking intrusive, deeply embarrassing questions about sexual matters. In 1998, when Starr’s team was preparing to question Bill Clinton under oath regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Kavanaugh wrote an internal memo titled “Slack for the President?” in which he said that he was “strongly opposed to giving the President any ‘break’ in the questioning regarding the details of the Lewinsky relationship” unless the president resigned or “confess[ed].”
        
          In his memo, Kavanaugh proceeded to advocate for what he described as “ ‘full and complete’ testimony” from Clinton and proposed a number of specific questions in order to “gather[] the full facts regarding the actions of [the] President.” Among the queries Kavanaugh suggested: Did Clinton have phone sex with Ms. Lewinsky 15 times? Did Clinton ejaculate in a White House sink? Did the president masturbate into a trash can in his secretary’s office?
        
          As Helaine Olen recently observed in the Washington Post, while the Starr team’s actual questioning of Clinton was highly graphic, it was arguably less intrusive than what Kavanaugh had advocated for.
        
          Based on the reasoning of prosecutor Kavanaugh, it should be wholly proper for Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh to be “forced to account for” his actions before the nation.
        
          I’d imagine that prosecutor Kavanaugh would ask Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh questions including the following:
        
          • Whether, as alleged by Christine Blasey Ford, during a drinking binge, Kavanaugh forced her into a room, put his hand over her mouth, tried to remove her clothes as she struggled to get away, and treated her so roughly she reasonably feared for her life;
        
          • Whether, as alleged by Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh, again while highly inebriated, pulled down his pants before Ramirez and presented his penis to her while others laughed and one onlooker taunted her to “kiss it”; and
        
          • Whether, as alleged by Julie Swetnick, Kavanaugh, while drunk, repeatedly “ground” himself against women and attempted to fondle and grab them without their consent, as well as whether he was present while a drugged and debilitated Swetnick was gang raped.
        
          Kavanaugh has reportedly refused to answer similar questions during his preparation sessions, arguing that they were “too personal.” Yet prosecutor Kavanaugh had no patience with such considerations, arguing to fellow members of Starr’s team that “it is our job to make [the witness’s] pattern of revolting behavior clear—piece by painful piece.” Furthermore, while Kavanaugh has since questioned whether presidents should be subject to criminal investigations while in office, he has not disavowed his memo nor suggested that the questioning of President Clinton was conducted improperly.
        
          Now it is Kavanaugh’s turn to face such an intrusive inquiry. Indeed, as Kavanaugh stated in his memorandum regarding the testimony of President Clinton, if the questioners do not undertake such a searching examination, they will be “failing to fulfill [their] duty to the American people.”

          There are plenty of reasons why Republicans want to push Brett Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court as quickly as possible, but the biggest one may also be the most obvious: They need his vote. The court is currently divided 4–4 between liberal and conservative justices, creating a momentary opening for progressives. If the Senate drags its feet on appointing a new justice, the court will likely deadlock in several important cases involving labor rights, endangered species, the death penalty, and possibly even the transgender troops ban. This stalemate will cement liberal victories in the lower courts and thwart a conservative rout. The GOP needs a fifth man on the bench, and every day without Justice Kavanaugh is a wasted opportunity.
        
          Right now, the main obstacle to Kavanaugh’s confirmation is Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that the nominee assaulted her in high school. Her credible accusation has already delayed the process by several days as senators haggle over hearings. There is nothing suspicious about Ford’s timing. Nevertheless, the resulting delay in appointing a new justice will likely have an effect on a number of cases that are scheduled to come before the Supreme Court this fall.
        
          On Oct. 1, the court will hear Weyerhaeuser Company v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an effort to weaken the Endangered Species Act. Weyerhaeuser Co. wants to harvest timber on a Louisiana site that serves as the habitat for an endangered species: the dusky gopher frog. The federal government won’t let it.
        
          There’s a good reason why. The dusky gopher frog used to live in a large swath of the South, but there are now just 135 of them in the wild, all of whom can be found in a Mississippi pond. Outside of Mississippi, they were last spotted in the wild at a site in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, in 1965. While they no longer live there, the site still contains the “extremely rare ephemeral ponds on which the frog depends.” The government wants to restore the ponds and introduce the frogs. Weyerhaeuser Co., which owns the land, wants to chop down all the trees, destroying the habitat. So it sued, arguing that the Fish and Wildlife Service has no authority to halt its plans.
        
          You may not care about the dusky gopher frog—though it is said to be a charming critter—but you should care about this case if you support the Endangered Species Act. That’s because Weyerhaeuser is merely the latest chapter in corporations’ endless war on the ESA. The timber industry has long sought to hobble the law by limiting the federal government’s ability to preserve land that’s vital for endangered species. If timber firms can persuade the courts to overrule the government’s determination regarding which habitats must be protected, they can open up more land to logging. That’s why Weyerhaeuser Co. is asking SCOTUS to hold that the government can’t set aside habitat unless it’s absolutely necessary for a species’ immediate survival.
        
          Had Kavanaugh joined the court in late September, he probably would’ve cast the fifth vote in Weyerhaeuser condemning the dusky gopher frog to a near-certain demise. Now, the justices may instead divide 4–4, affirming the lower-court’s decision in favor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
        
          A day after the dusky gopher frog gets its day in court, the justices will turn to the death penalty. When the court hears Madison v. Alabama on Oct. 2, it will confront a grave question: May a state execute a death row inmate who, though competent when he committed his offense, is now so mentally disabled that he cannot remember the crime? Vernon Madison, the prisoner in question, is in his late 60s and has such severe dementia that he cannot recite the alphabet. The Supreme Court has already prohibited the execution of individuals who were intellectually disabled at the time of their offenses. Madison’s lawyers assert that its logic should extend to Madison, as no “penological justification or retributive value can be found in executing a severely impaired and incompetent prisoner.”
        
          There’s very little doubt that the conservative justices would permit Madison’s execution, while the liberal justices will oppose it. If they split 4–4, that’s bad news for Madison: The lower court rejected his argument, and he needs five justices to reverse that decision. But for other death row inmates, a SCOTUS logjam would certainly be better than a loss. Because most prisoners spend decades awaiting execution, America mostly executes seniors, many of whom have a variety of disabilities. Those who develop dementia, Alzheimer’s, and other mental disorders could continue to argue that their deaths at the hands of the state would violate the Constitution. Without Kavanaugh’s vote, this area of the law will remain unsettled. With his vote, the courthouse door may well shut on them for good.
        
          On Oct. 3, one day after arguments in Madison, the court will hear New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira. This case marks yet another effort by corporations to prevent workers from filing lawsuits and instead shunt them into mandatory arbitration, which strongly favors employers. The Supreme Court has bolstered this corporate campaign in a series of preposterous 5–4 rulings. These decisions turned the Federal Arbitration Act, a 1925 law meant to speed up commercial disputes, into a blunt object that employers can use to kick workers’ lawsuits out of court.
        
          Luckily, the Federal Arbitration Act has an exception for transportation workers, which, by its plain terms, should apply to both formal employees and independent contractors. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held precisely that in 2017, concluding that transportation companies could not use it to force independent contractors into arbitration. When the Supreme Court agreed the hear the case, it was obviously planning to reverse the 1st Circuit and crush this exception. But that can’t happen without Kavanaugh’s vote. And as a result, labor activists could avoid another catastrophe at SCOTUS.
        
          Perhaps the most consequential case that could reach the justices in the coming weeks and months, however, is the Trump administration’s ban on transgender troops. As I reported in March, Trump’s ban was spearheaded not by the military, but by anti-gay activists allied with Vice President Mike Pence. Service members suing to block the policy have demanded access to documents pertaining to military deliberations over its implementation. If released, those documents could reveal that the ban is not driven by legitimate concerns.
        
          After a federal district court ordered the government to prepare these documents for discovery, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to step in. Its request was wildly premature since the court hadn’t even directed the DOJ to turn over the information, just to assemble it in advance. The DOJ stood down on Monday when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the district court’s order. But the 9th Circuit will decide this case on a highly expedited schedule, with a possible ruling in October. (It’s expected to rule against the government.) At that point, the Justice Department could file an emergency motion with the Supreme Court to shield the documents, which are key to the plaintiffs’ case. Without Kavanaugh’s vote, the Trump administration is toast.
        
          SCOTUS packed its October docket with significant cases with the expectation of a full court. Now it appears that Kavanaugh’s confirmation could be pushed back by a few weeks—and if he withdraws, the months-long nomination process would begin all over again. Republicans have a clear interest in briskly filling this slot. But by nominating a candidate as flawed as Kavanaugh, Donald Trump has unintentionally postponed the Supreme Court’s conservative revolution.

          The accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are widely perceived to be a boon to Democrats heading into the midterm elections in November. “The women of this country identify with Dr. Ford and will not forget what is happening here,” Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, told NBC News over the weekend. “They are not angry, they are furious, and I expect the largest women’s turnout in a midterm—ever.”
        
          In fact, however, the Kavanaugh spectacle seems to have evaporated the Democrats’ enthusiasm edge, according to a poll conducted Monday by NPR, PBS NewsHour, and Marist. In July Democrats were likelier, by 10 percentage points, to say the November elections were “very important.” That gap has now narrowed to a statistical tie. “The result of the hearings, at least in the short run, is the Republican base was awakened,” Marist head Lee Miringoff told NPR.
        
          The change is particularly striking when comparing women in the two parties. Of all the cohorts measured by the poll (including Independent men and women), Democratic women are the only group to display less enthusiasm for the midterms this week than they did in July. Meanwhile, Republican women seem invigorated. In July, 81 percent of Democratic women said the November elections were very important, compared to 71 percent of Republican women. Now, Republican women are 4 percentage points likelier to view the midterms that way (83 percent to 79 percent). That’s a 14-point swing in female voters’ interest in the midterms—after the hearings, and in Republicans’ favor.
        
          The titanic anger of progressive women has been a dominant theme in the media since President Trump’s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton two years ago. Two major books about female rage have been published this fall, including Good and Mad by writer and reporter Rebecca Traister. “This political moment has provoked a period in which more and more women have been in no mood to dress their fury up as anything other than raw and burning rage,” Traister wrote in the New York Times on Saturday. “Many women are yelling, shouting, using Sharpies to etch sharply worded slogans onto protest signs, making furious phone calls to representatives.”
        
          But women’s rage is not a chorus performed in unison. Atlantic reporter Emma Green talked with about a dozen female conservative leaders across the country for a story this week that puts flesh on the Marist poll’s finding: that the Kavanaugh hearings have electrified conservative women too. “I’ve got women in my church who were not politically active at all who were incensed with this,” the chairwoman of the West Virginia Republican Party told Green. The Indiana state director for the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List, Jodi Smith, told Green that “people in Indiana are angry.” In her view, the hearings are “one of the best things that could happen to us” as she looks forward to a hotly contested Senate election in the state in November.
        
          The Marist poll is just one poll. And conservative women plugged into state and local politics were already very likely to vote (and vote Republican) before the Senate hearings. Their new outrage over Kavanaugh’s supposed mistreatment won’t make their votes count more. But their reactions may indicate that less-engaged Republican women are feeling similarly outraged, or even just ambivalent, about the Kavanaugh accusations.
        
          The Kavanaugh hearings have riveted the country in a way that few news stories have the power to do. Almost 20 percent of American households watched portions of the testimony last week; that figure does not include people who streamed the hearings online or listened on the radio. In my own anecdotal observation, my evangelical-heavy Facebook feed has been taken over by posts about accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s credibility, often written by women, including those who rarely post about politics. “There is total manipulation of this process—it’s disgusting,” one woman wrote on an evangelical friend’s post that proposed it was impossible to know who was lying. “I believe she was assaulted [but] I simply refuse to believe it was him.” Others argue that Ford’s evidence is too thin, that Kavanaugh’s good name has been permanently smeared, that his family is suffering unjustly.
        
          Trump’s own rhetoric is a decent barometer of the kind of populist conservative energy that can otherwise be hard to track. At the end of last week, he soberly called Ford “a very fine woman” and said her testimony was compelling. This week, he radically revised his tone. “What he’s going through … ,” he mused to a crowd at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday, before drifting into a riff that mocked the gaps in Ford’s memory. Then he circled back to Kavanaugh, the episode’s real victim. “A man’s life is in tatters,” he said. “A man’s life is shattered. His wife is shattered. His daughters who are beautiful, incredible young kids.” Behind him, two fans held up bright pink signs reading “Women for Trump.”

          As Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was trying to rehabilitate his image in a Fox News interview Monday, the New York Times published an excerpt from Kavanaugh’s senior yearbook page that contradicts the studious, churchgoing image Kavanaugh was pushing of himself as a teenager. On Kavanaugh’s senior page, there were references to drinking and partying, as well as “Renate Alumnius,” which the Times reports is a reference to Renate Schroeder, a student at an area Catholic girls’ school at the time. The “Alumnius” appears to be a misspelling of either “alumnus” or “alumni,” which appear on a number of his classmates pages.
        
          “The word ‘Renate’ appears at least 14 times in Georgetown Preparatory School’s 1983 yearbook, on individuals’ pages and in a group photo of nine football players, including Judge Kavanaugh, who were described as the ‘Renate Alumni,’” the Times reports. “Two of Judge Kavanaugh’s classmates say the mentions of Renate were part of the football players’ unsubstantiated boasting about their conquests.” The former students the Times spoke to offered differing versions of what “Renate Alumni” meant exactly, with the more charitable reading asserting it was a reference to those that dated Schroeder.
        
          Earlier this month, Renate Schroeder Dolphin was one of the 65 women who signed a letter in support of Kavanaugh in response to the sexual assault allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that dates back to their high school years. “We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983,” the letter begins. “For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect.”
        
          “I learned about these yearbook pages only a few days ago,” Dolphin said in a statement to Times about the yearbook. “I don’t know what ‘Renate Alumnus’ actually means. I can’t begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year-old boys who write such things, but the insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated this way. I will have no further comment.” In a statement, a lawyer for Kavanaugh tried to soften the implication and the nature of their relationship. “Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event,” the statement reads. “They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.” Dolphin, however, refuted that claim. “I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,” she said through her lawyer.

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-employees-joel-kaplan-supported-kavanaugh-hearing.html,"
          When Facebook’s vice president of global public policy, Joel Kaplan, a former aide to President George W. Bush who joined Facebook in 2011, decided to sit two rows behind his longtime friend Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, the seasoned Republican operative surely expected someone would notice. His colleagues back in Menlo Park sure did. Since the hearing, hundreds of Facebook employees have expressed objection within the company over Kaplan’s public show of support of Kavanuagh—so much so that it’s caused a firestorm within Facebook that the company is struggling to contain.
        
          According to reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, equivocating internal responses from Facebook’s top brass have only fanned the flames. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reportedly told employees that Kaplan didn’t violate any company policies, though appearing in the hearing room is not a move he would have made. Chief Operating Officer Cheryl Sandberg replied to an internal company thread on Kaplan’s appearance that has garnered hundreds of comments, saying that she spoke with him about why “it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in the company.” They were responding to—but hardly allaying—the shock and outrage that Facebook employees were expressing after seeing one of their executives show up in support of an accused sexual assaulter’s confirmation during a time of public pain for women across the country.
        
          But it was an internal statement, obtained by the New York Times, from longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth that put what may have been implied in Sandberg and Zuckerberg’s statements most bluntly: “If you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand. We will support you with any path you choose. But it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.” Whether or not Bosworth’s C-suite peers agree with him, he’s right that this moment represents something of a crossroads. Tech workers have become ever more vocal over the last two years in speaking out against their employers’ interactions with the Trump administration (particularly on issues like immigration, espionage, and defense). And few personal acts that take place in the public glare can escape the politics of our moment. Now those facts are coming into conflict in Facebook’s backyard.
        
          In some ways, the uproar within Facebook exposes a naiveté on the part of some employees, who may feel their work is still making the world a better, tighter-knit place, but who also should know by now that they’re working for a global targeted advertising company. Facebook needs to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, which means collaborating with political figures that some employees may find troubling or even abhorrent. This is especially true at a moment when politicians in both parties have found reasons—both fair and unfair—to scrutinize Facebook. So of course it will hire right-leaning operatives like Joel Kaplan—and of course Kaplan will have personal relationships with people like Kavanaugh.
        
          But the issue clearly doesn’t end there, as Facebook is learning.
        
          The employee activism within tech companies that’s been on the rise over the past year has been a heartening development. There was the petition against Google’s work helping to build A.I. for drones with the Pentagon, which ultimately led the company to drop the contract. Hundreds of Microsoft employees signed a letter to the company leadership in protest of its contracts with Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement during the height of the public outrage over the Trump administration’s family separation policy. It was only last year that Zuckerberg said that Facebook, for all its problems, ultimately aims to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” This may still be the goal, but it’s becoming clear that bringing the world closer together, for Facebook, depends on making gobs of money, and doing that means staying on the good side of Congress.
        
          But Facebook also needs a workforce, which is why Boswell’s admonishment for employees to grow up won’t help. If Facebook can’t recruit—if it becomes known as a workplace that’s insensitive to workers, workers who may have seen echoes of their own lives in Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s heartfelt testimony—it also can’t do its job. If prospective workers conclude that the better world that Facebook wants to build is one where accusations of sexual assault are dismissed, they may decided that’s a world they no longer want to build.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-baseball-debt-democrats-hearing-missing.html,"
          Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have attacked Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination from a number of angles during his confirmation hearings this week, suggesting that he twists the law to achieve right-wing ideological goals, has been propped up with the help of sleazy tactics that have hidden his record from the public, and has been nominated in part to protect Donald Trump from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. One thing Democrats haven’t asked Kavanaugh about—and don’t appear to plan to, given that their time to ask direct questions has run out—is the weird story of his personal debt.
        
          As first reported by the Washington Post, Kavanaugh’s financial disclosure forms indicate that, as of 2016, he carried somewhere between $60,000 and $200,000 in debt on three credit cards plus a personal loan. The White House’s explanation for why a successful 53-year-old lawyer and judge would have that much credit card debt was that Kavanaugh really liked going to baseball games:
        
          A ProPublica piece about Kavanaugh’s tickets notes that he’s been seen at Nationals games in seats near first base. Season tickets at the “Dugout Premier” price level in that area would cost about $9,000 a year. The judge, therefore, would have had to have fronted the cost of seven such top-level season tickets just to reach the lower limit of what his debt was said to be.
        
          In 2017, all of Kavanaugh’s debt besides his home mortgage was gone, which the White House says was because “Kavanaugh’s friends reimbursed him for their share of the baseball tickets.” The administration wouldn’t provide any more details.
        
          Incidentally, in one of the previously undisclosed emails from Kavanaugh’s time in the George W. Bush White House that was released Thursday, he apologizes to several friends for “growing aggressive after blowing still another game of dice” during a weekend trip and then instructs them “to be very, very vigilant w/r/t confidentiality on all issues and all fronts, including with spouses.”
        
          To be fair to Kavanaugh, the dice comment could have been tongue in cheek, and the confidentiality could have referred to work-related discussions rather than personal chicanery. But we don’t know, because no one on the Senate Judiciary Committee asked him to explain it.
        
          I’m not a master of jurisprudential ethics, but I’ve read a few thrillers, and it seems like having a Supreme Court justice who likes to gamble and racks up huge debts that he explains implausibly and which disappear mysteriously may not be the best idea, as far as preventing potential corruption or conflicts of interest, right?

          On Friday, Sen. Jeff Flake was joined by Sen. Lisa Murkowski and other swing-vote senators in calling for a one-week FBI investigation into the recent allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to be completed before a final vote on his confirmation is held. Senate Republicans and the White House then announced that the bureau would, in fact, take a week to review “current credible allegations” against Kavanaugh.
        
          It’s not clear yet what exactly that means: Will the FBI investigate all three of the public accusations against Kavanaugh as well as the potentially false statements about drinking and sex he made during Thursday’s testimony in an attempt to exonerate himself? Or will agents merely examine Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982, the only accusation that was addressed at length in Thursday’s hearing?* The latest reporting indicates that the FBI itself will get to make that determination:
        
          If there is a wide inquiry into Kavanaugh’s three accusers and his related statements, here’s a list of people whom the bureau might want to talk to:
        
          • Mark Judge. Judge, whom Ford alleges was in the room when Kavanaugh assaulted her, has so much to tell: Did Kavanaugh ever get blackout drunk, as he denies? Does Judge know Ford? He’s said he doesn’t remember Kavanaugh sexually assaulting Ford or any other women in the manner she describes, but does he remember Kavanaugh treating any other women inappropriately at all? Did Judge ever take turns with other boys having sex with a drunk woman, as he allegedly told his ex-girlfriend he did and as third Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick alleges happened to her with Kavanaugh present? Did Kavanaugh?
        
          While there’s been speculation that Judge would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions about his alleged involvement in these acts, he said through an attorney Friday that he would cooperate with the FBI or any other agency “confidentially” investigating said subjects. (It’s not yet clear how widely the FBI’s work will be distributed; background-check information gathered for Senate hearings are typically given to the White House counsel’s office, which can give the information to committee members and work with them to determine specific followup questions that need to be answered.)**
        
          • Elizabeth Rasor. Judge’s ex-girlfriend told the New Yorker that Judge confessed to her that he’d participated in a so-called sexual lineup with a drunk young woman. She could elaborate on that and speak more generally as to whether Ford’s claims about Judge are credible.
        
          • Julie Swetnick. A client of Democratic lawyer and attention-seeker Michael Avenatti, Swetnick came forward this week with a sworn declaration alleging that she socialized with Judge and Kavanaugh and knew them to be part of a group of boys who would “target” and take advantage of intoxicated women sexually, sometimes in a “train”-style rape. She also says she was at one point the victim of such activities. (Swetnick does not say Kavanaugh participated in these “trains” but claims that she saw him with Judge “lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room.”) Swetnick’s allegation is not entirely out of line with what Rasor told the New Yorker, but she and Avenatti haven’t yet disclosed any information, such as details about where alleged assaults took place or names of individuals whom Swetnick talked to about this at the time, that would allow for corroboration.
        
          • Tim Gaudette. Per Kavanaugh’s testimony, this is the “Timmy” whose house Kavanaugh visited for “skis” (aka brewskis, aka beer) on July 1, 1982, according to the calendar he presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee. By Kavanaugh’s own record of his activities that summer, this seems like the most likely night he could have committed the assault Ford alleges, because all three of the men she remembers in the house that evening were listed in the calendar entry.
        
          • Tim Gaudette’s parents. Were they home the night of July 1, 1982? Did they let Timmy and his friends drink at their house alone?
        
          • Tom Kaine, P. J. Smyth, and Bernie McCarthy. These three other (former) boys were listed in the Kavanaugh calendar entry as attendees of the ’skis gathering at Timmy’s house. Ford also specifically remembers Smyth being at the house the night of her alleged assault; he’s said he doesn’t remember such a gathering. He and the others could be asked under oath whether they remember any similar gatherings, and what Kavanaugh did at those, and where they took place. They could be asked whether they really didn’t drink on weeknights, as Kavanaugh claimed in Thursday’s hearing, and whether Kavanaugh ever got so drunk that he passed out or blacked out, as he has denied ever doing.
        
          • Chris Garrett, aka “Squi.” Kavanaugh’s calendar has Garrett at the hangout at Timmy’s house too. Per Ford’s testimony, Garrett also dated Ford while both were in high school and introduced her to Kavanaugh. Among other things, he can confirm whether Kavanaugh knew Ford, which Kavanaugh says he did not. Conservatives have also advanced a far-fetched theory that Garrett, who bears some resemblance to Kavanaugh, is Ford’s true assailant, and he could be allowed to answer to those charges.
        
          • “Tobin.” According to Kavanaugh’s calendar, he was working out at “Tobin’s house” before going to Timmy’s for ’skis, and at the hearing Kavanaugh indeed talked about working out at Tobin’s much of the summer with other members of the football team. Did Kavanaugh say where they were going that night? Did workouts often precede parties? How long did workouts last, and when would Kavanaugh have left?
        
          • Leland Keyser. A good friend of Ford’s in high school, Keyser says she doesn’t remember any gathering like the one Ford claims to have been sexually assaulted at, though Ford says Keyser was there. Even so, Keyser says she believes Ford’s allegations. The FBI should ask her why.
        
          • Former employees of the Columbia Country Club. This is where Ford says she likely learned of the party where she says she was assaulted. Does anyone who worked there remember Ford or Kavanaugh? Ford says she swam at the club before going to the house where she was sexually assaulted. Did anyone ever see her leave the club with one of the men who she says was present at the party, or have any other information that could pinpoint where it took place?
        
          • The Safeway human resources department. Ford says she saw Judge six to eight weeks after her alleged 1982 assault at a local Safeway where he worked. A passage in Judge’s memoir, which says he worked at a “supermarket” that summer, appears to confirm that such an encounter was possible, but employment records could presumably settle the matter definitively.
        
          • Renate Schroeder Dolphin and associated Georgetown Prep students. Kavanaugh has said the now-infamous yearbook entry listing him as a “Renate Alumnius”—a listing that a number of other Georgetown Prep football players included on their pages—was intended as an affectionate reference to taking Dolphin to dances, not as a crude insinuation about having sex with her. Do the other players share that take? Did Dolphin kiss Kavanaugh, as Kavanaugh’s lawyer claims she did, but Dolphin denies? How did Kavanaugh and the other guys who listed themselves as her “alumni” treat her in high school? Did she ever see them at parties?
        
          • Deborah Ramirez and witnesses. In a New Yorker story, Ramirez said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and made crude remarks at a party during their freshman year at Yale. The magazine says she acknowledges there are “significant gaps in her memories of the evening” because she was drinking, and that no other individuals who were present at the party could be located who confirmed her account. More than one former Yale student told the New Yorker they remember hearing about the alleged incident after it occurred, though—suggesting that it was memorable enough to others that an investigation with the resources of the FBI behind it might be able to locate direct witnesses. In fact, New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer says Yale alumni were emailing about the alleged incident in July, before she and Ronan Farrow spoke to Ramirez and also before Ford went public.
        
          • James Roche. Kavanaugh’s freshman-year roommate at Yale says he believes Kavanaugh would have shoved his exposed genitals in a drunk Deborah Ramirez’s face, as Ramirez alleges. He has also described Kavanaugh as “frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk,” which conflicts with Kavanaugh’s own characterization of his alcohol use.
        
          • Kit Winter. Winter, who lived with Kavanaugh and Roche during that freshman year, told the Cut that Kavanaugh and his friends were “loud, obnoxious frat boy–like drunks” and that as a result “people were constantly puking in the bathroom” that they shared. Kavanaugh told Congress that he was not a “sloppy drunk” and has never suffered memory loss as a result of drinking; Winter could speak to investigators about the plausibility of those claims. (Winter told the Cut he found it “very hard to believe” Kavanaugh never had drinking-related memory loss.)
        
          • Liz Swisher. Swisher, a Yale graduate, says she was friends with Kavanaugh at the school. She contacted the Washington Post after Kavanaugh claimed in his Monday Fox News interview that he’d never had memory loss while drinking. Said Swisher: “Brett was a sloppy drunk, and I know because I drank with him. I watched him drink more than a lot of people. He’d end up slurring his words, stumbling. There’s no medical way I can say that he was blacked out. … But it’s not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess.”
        
          • David White and Chris Dudley. White, a football player, was a friend and roommate of Kavanaugh’s. Dudley, who went on to play in the NBA, was a friend. Kavanaugh mentioned both on Thursday as individuals who could vouch for his claims that he was not a belligerent or blackout-level drinker.
        
          • Steve Kantrowitz. Another former Yale classmate, Kantrowitz—now a history professor at the University of Wisconsin—tweeted after Kavanaugh claimed in his Fox interview to have been a virgin well into college that Kavanaugh had told him otherwise when they were freshmen. It’s a strange issue to be litigating, of course, and young men lie about their sexual experience all the time, but it speaks to whether Kavanaugh was honest when he told the Senate the same virginity line.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-alleged-sexual-assault-denials-are-increasingly-dubious.html,"
          Over the past week, Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, has issued a series of denials about his behavior involving women, parties, and alcohol. Some of his denials have been contradicted by witnesses. Others are at risk of being falsified as additional witnesses come forward. Kavanaugh could be telling the truth. But the weight of testimony against him is becoming too heavy to endure.
        
          Kavanaugh’s first statement, issued on Sept. 14, was a response to a letter from Christine Blasey Ford. In the letter, which Ford sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Ford alleged that in 1982, Kavanaugh had pushed her into a bedroom, climbed on top of her, put his hand over her mouth to silence her, and tried to remove her clothes. Kavanaugh’s statement denied “this allegation,” leaving open the possibility that he might have engaged in sexually aggressive behavior under other circumstances. But in a statement on Sept. 17, he ruled out that possibility. “I have never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone,” he declared.
        
          Kavanaugh issued brief follow-up statements on Sept. 20 and Sept. 23. But in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 24, he crossed a line. Responding to a second allegation—this time from Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her during a drinking game in college—he wrote, “Once again, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened.” The phrase “once again” referred to Ford’s allegation. But Kavanaugh’s implication—that the alleged witnesses to the Ford incident had denied it ever happened—put him in conflict with a third woman. That woman, Leland Keyser, was one of the people alleged by Ford to have attended the 1982 gathering. On Sept. 23, the Washington Post reported that Keyser “said she did not recall the party but believed Ford’s account.” That doesn’t match Kavanaugh’s characterization in his Sept. 24 letter. Arguably, it says the opposite.
        
          The next day, Sept. 25, Kavanaugh went further. In an interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum, he denied any physical contact with Ford. MacCallum asked, “You … never kissed her, never touched her, nothing that you remember?” Kavanaugh replied, “Correct. I never had any sexual or physical activity with Dr. Ford.” He added, “I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.” And he denied not just the party in question but anything like the house or the scene Ford had described. “I was not anywhere at any place resembling that in the summer of 1982,” he said.
        
          Kavanaugh issued a similarly broad denial of Ramirez’s story: “I never did any such thing.” When MacCallum brought up insinuations from attorney Michael Avenatti about additional accusations—this time involving high school parties where boys had allegedly lined up for sex with women incapacitated by alcohol or drugs—Kavanaugh denied that, too. MacCallum asked the nominee whether he’d ever had “any sense” of being at a party where women were taken to rooms for sex with multiple men, even “consensually.” Kavanaugh replied, “I never saw any such thing.”
        
          In free-floating comments during the interview, Kavanaugh denied that anything like the stories that had been told about him could be true. “I didn’t do this or anything resembling this,” he insisted. Later, he repeated, “I’ve never, never done anything like this.” He also denied ever having consumed alcohol to the point of memory impairment:
        
          These statements were risky. If witnesses were to come forward and say that they saw Kavanaugh do any of these things, his credibility would be trashed. The range of acts he denied was considerable: drinking to the point of memory impairment, having anything close to sex in high school, being at any place resembling the alleged 1982 party, and being at any party where women in bedrooms had sex with multiple men.
        
          A day after Kavanaugh’s interview, another witness, Julie Swetnick, contradicted it. She was the woman whose pending allegations Avenatti had touted. In a declaration signed on Sept. 25, she asserted under penalty of perjury: “I have reviewed Brett Kavanaugh’s recent claim on Fox News regarding his alleged ‘innocence’ during his high school years and lack of sexual activity. This is absolutely false and a lie. I witnessed Brett Kavanaugh consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s.”
        
          Swetnick accused Kavanaugh and his friends of serious offenses. She said she had been raped at a party he attended, and she claimed to have “witnessed efforts by [Kavanaugh’s friend] Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented” so they could be similarly attacked. She added, “I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room. These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.”
        
          Skeptics dismissed Swetnick’s allegations as bizarre and uncorroborated. But they matched an account given to the New Yorker by Elizabeth Rasor, a former girlfriend of Judge. According to the magazine, Rasor “recalled that Judge had told her ashamedly of an incident that involved him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman. Rasor said that Judge seemed to regard it as fully consensual.”
        
          Beyond these extreme incidents, Swetnick reported other observations that contradicted Kavanaugh’s denials:
        
          Swetnick claimed to have supporting witnesses. She said that shortly after she was raped, she had told two other people. She asserted that “other women” had told her about similar conduct by Kavanaugh “during the Summer months in Ocean City, Maryland on numerous occasions.” And at the conclusion of her allegations, she alleged that she knew of “other witnesses” who could “attest to the truthfulness of each of the statements above.”
        
          On Wednesday evening, NBC News reported yet another allegation. According to the story, an anonymous woman has told the office of Sen. Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, that Kavanaugh “physically assaulted a woman he socialized with in the Washington, D.C., area in 1998 while he was inebriated.”* The woman who sent the report said Kavanaugh “shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually.” She added, “There were at least four witnesses including my daughter.”
        
          Kavanaugh dismisses this story too. But the number of accusers is piling up, and some of their stories are converging. In a written statement sent to the Judiciary Committee late on Wednesday, Ford offered more details about what Kavanaugh allegedly did to her in 1982. “Brett got on top of me,” she wrote. “He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me.” That echoed Swetnick’s report about Kavanaugh “grinding against girls” at parties.
        
          For Kavanaugh’s supporters, the bottom line is grim. You can still believe that he’s telling the truth. But in order to believe that, you’ll have to believe that more and more women are lying.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-ken-starr-work-he-violated-justice-department-policies.html,"
          According to President Trump, Brett Kavanaugh is an “extraordinary man” with an “unblemished record” and an “impeccable reputation.” Sen. Orrin Hatch describes the Supreme Court nominee as a “person of immense integrity” who has always been “honest” and “truthful” and “very, very decent.” These two and other Kavanaugh defenders argue that, because the judge’s “character and integrity” are purportedly “unassailable,” Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against him should be disbelieved.
        
          As the nation has repeatedly learned, such rosy character attestations are of limited value in judging the merits of an allegation of sexual misconduct against a prominent individual. Furthermore, in Kavanaugh’s case, reliance on claims about his “character and integrity” are all the more dubious given that a number of serious questions regarding his professional conduct remain unanswered in the wake of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s rushed confirmation hearings.
        
          There are still substantial questions, for instance, regarding Kavanaugh’s tenure as a White House staffer in the George W. Bush administration. Most notable among them is whether he knowingly misused materials stolen from Democratic senators’ offices to further efforts to confirm several controversial Bush judicial nominees and whether he lied about the matter under oath during multiple hearings. Other questions regarding Kavanaugh’s White House tenure could not even be meaningfully explored during the confirmation hearings because so many relevant documents were withheld (or not even requested), including materials relating to Kavanaugh’s possible role in reviewing the CIA’s use of “enhanced interrogation” techniques against certain detainees.
        
          But the least-examined portion of Kavanaugh’s career concerns his role as an associate counsel under Ken Starr during the multiple investigations of President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and others. Among the most important unanswered questions about Kavanaugh’s years as a prosecutor is whether he provided selective leaks to favored journalists in contravention of Justice Department policies respecting the confidentiality of criminal investigations.
        
          Prosecutors and investigators are generally directed to avoid even disclosing the existence of ongoing investigations, let alone serving as confidential sources regarding the substance of sensitive, nonpublic facts gleaned in criminal inquiries. This policy of confidentiality is intended to protect the rights of both victims and defendants. As the Department of Justice U.S. Attorneys’ Manual provisions in force at the time of Starr’s investigation explained, the department has long had a general policy of “not respond[ing] to questions about the existence of an ongoing investigation or comment[ing] on its nature or progress.” Even in unusual “circumstances,” when a comment on an ongoing investigation “need[s]” to be made—such as to address existing publicity regarding a matter—media contacts had to be approved in advance by the U.S. attorney or DOJ official in charge. Furthermore, a knowing violation by a law enforcement officer of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures’ restrictions on the disclosure of information obtained in grand jury proceedings can result in a finding of contempt.
        
          One need only look to the last presidential race to confirm the wisdom of these policies in favor of maintaining the confidentiality of ongoing investigations, given that James Comey’s repeated comments regarding a criminal investigation that did not even end with charges may have swayed the outcome of the election.
        
          It appears clear, however, that Starr’s Office of Independent Counsel had little regard for the DOJ’s policies regarding press contacts. The Starr team’s off-the-record media communications during its investigation of President Clinton’s sexual activities were so extensive, and so questionable, that they ultimately led a federal judge to commission an investigation into whether members of Starr’s staff violated the prohibitions on disclosing grand jury information. (No charges of illegal conduct were ultimately levied.) Furthermore, Starr’s press liaison was the subject of an (ultimately unsuccessful) criminal prosecution arising from his role in leaking information related to Starr’s contemplation of a potential indictment of President Clinton.
        
          The Starr office’s systemic leaking actually began years earlier and was in full swing when Starr embarked on a three-year investigation into the death of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster. By the time Starr came on the scene, there was no actual mystery surrounding Foster’s death. Starr’s predecessor, Robert Fiske, had already fully investigated the matter and confirmed that Foster had taken his own life. Yet Foster’s demise was the obsessive focus of a then-emerging group of right-wing conspiracists, including, most notoriously, GOP House member Dan Burton, who filmed himself shooting melons in an amateur forensic effort to challenge the merits of the FBI’s investigation. The most audacious conspiracists were hellbent on proving that the president and his wife had killed (or covered up the purported murder of) Foster, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest friends, in order to keep him from telling the “truth.” As former Clinton aide Paul Begala recently stated, Starr “tormented” Foster’s family by pandering to these conspiracy theorists through his pursuit of an extremely lengthy, and utterly unnecessary, investigation.
        
          Starr relied on Brett Kavanaugh to document the results of his sprawling Foster investigation. One might question why Kavanaugh, who was coming off a clerkship for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy (whom he has been nominated to succeed) and was even then marked for a brilliant career in the law, chose to spend years of his life conducting such an utterly pointless “investigation” into a suicide. The likely answer is that Starr, Kavanaugh’s then-mentor, was determined to pursue any and all potential avenues for going after the president and his spouse and that Kavanaugh was not one to second-guess the boss.
        
          Starr had served as a federal appeals court judge as well as the solicitor general, but he was a loyal Republican as well. Unlike Robert Mueller, he approached his investigation as a public relations battle as well as a law enforcement endeavor. To that end, his office was intensely focused on cultivating its image in the press, particularly among rabid opponents of the president. To that end, his office leaked like a sieve.
        
          Starr has long admitted that he and his team regularly communicated with the press on an off-the-record basis, in apparent derogation of Justice Department policies. Recent revelations, including from Kavanaugh, have confirmed that these leaks were not merely responses to curious reporters. Rather, Starr himself directed his line prosecutors to assist those whom they perceived to be friendly journalists.
        
          In late 1997, Dan Moldea was working on a book about Foster’s death for Regnery, an imprint known to publish works by extreme right-wing authors. Moldea, though, is a liberal investigative journalist, and his book was an inquiry into how anti-Clinton propagandists had fabricated the story that Foster had been murdered.
        
          When Moldea got word that Starr was about to publish a report on Foster’s death, he contacted the independent counsel’s office. As Moldea recounts in a piece for National Memo, two of Starr’s senior deputies, Hickman Ewing and Jackie Bennett, rolled out the welcome mat for him, presumably because they believed he was a right-wing journalist. In a (perhaps inadvertently) on-the-record call, Ewing explained that Starr’s office had a practice of providing “non-public information on an off-the-record basis to certain reporters—if the OIC knew where they were ‘coming from’ and Ken Starr personally approved of them.” Ewing told Moldea that the office, and indeed Starr himself, had spoken with writers of two separate conspiracy-laden books on Foster’s death.
        
          Moldea asked for the opportunity to speak with Starr. Bennett responded, however, that if Moldea wanted to obtain “substantive information” about the Foster investigation, he would be better off speaking to “people who are most hands-on on this” and “really have better knowledge than Ken does.” Ewing later said he would ask Starr for permission for Moldea to speak with Brett Kavanaugh, whom he identified as a “young” and ”brilliant” guy who had primary responsibility for writing Starr’s report on Foster’s death (just as he would later play a principal role in writing the section of The Starr Report that advocated vigorously in favor of impeaching the president).
        
          Moldea states that he took up Ewing’s offer and met with Kavanaugh. Although it seems likely that, just as Ewing promised, Kavanaugh shared nonpublic, “substantive information” regarding Starr’s then-ongoing investigation into Foster’s death, the meeting was off the record. Moldea says he therefore remains bound by his agreement with Kavanaugh to maintain the confidentiality of the conversation.
        
          Moldea was hardly the only member of the press that met with Kavanaugh to discuss the Starr team’s ongoing criminal investigations. Journalists including Jonathan Alter and Stephen Brill—the latter of whom published a lengthy article regarding the Starr team’s leaking—have stated that Kavanaugh was a central operative in Starr’s off-the-record press operation.
        
          But we need not simply take these journalists’ words for it. In a questionnaire that Kavanaugh submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with his nomination to the Supreme Court, the judge—after specifically listing various on-the-record interviews he has granted during his career—stated, “I have also spoken to reporters on background as appropriate or as directed.” In his Senate submission, Kavanaugh chose not to identify the reporters at issue, even though, as the source, he faces no legal or ethical obligation to keep those communications secret. Kavanaugh has apparently also chosen not to release Moldea and the other reporters with whom he had off-the-record communications from their confidentiality obligations despite a specific request to do so by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse; those reporters thus remain bound to keep silent on the matter as well.
        
          Kavanaugh’s defenders have pointed to the fact that he is not among the Starr personnel mentioned in a recently unsealed report into whether Starr’s office illegally leaked grand jury material. But, as Moldea notes, that report was focused on the later investigation into President Clinton’s sexual activities, not the independent counsel’s inquiry into Vince Foster’s suicide. Furthermore, it was apparently prepared during a period in which Kavanaugh had taken a leave from the Starr team and was working in the private sector. In any event, the Justice Department’s confidentiality policies also extend well beyond grand jury material, and there is ample reason to believe that the Starr team regularly violated those policies.
        
          This matter goes to the heart of whether Kavanaugh has a practice of complying with important policies intended to protect the fairness and integrity of the justice system. Kavanaugh should be required to supplement his Senate submission by identifying each instance in which he spoke to reporters “on background as appropriate or as directed,” and to expressly relieve Moldea and any other journalists whom he spoke with of their confidentiality obligations.
        
          That would be small step toward determining whether Kavanaugh truly merits the reputation for “character and integrity” that Trump and others have ascribed to him.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-allegation-punishment.html,"
          Does a middle-aged man who attempted rape as a teenager deserve a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States? This question has become urgent in light of Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her in high school, pinning her down, covering her mouth, and attempting to undress her before she managed to escape the room. Kavanaugh totally denies the accusation, stating, “I have never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone.” It appears the Senate will hear from both Ford and Kavanaugh at a public hearing next week before taking any votes.
        
          What if a majority of the Senate concludes that Kavanaugh probably did assault Ford at age 17? Should that fact disqualify him from SCOTUS? Not everyone is so sure. The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle tweeted that she “wouldn’t disqualify anyone from higher office because of anything they had done as a minor.” Writer and academic Tom Nichols doubted whether the accusation, if true, is even relevant today. Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, declared in a viral thread that she is “uncomfortable with asserting that [Kavanaugh’s] behavior as a teen tells us anything about his ‘character’ now.” David Plotz, CEO of Atlas Obscura and Slate’s former editor in chief, signaled his agreement with Brooks.
        
          It is entirely reasonable to feel uncomfortable holding 17-year-olds strictly liable for their misdeeds for the rest of their lives. Fortunately, that is not what’s happening here, which makes this argument around age a red herring. Kavanaugh is not asking for absolution; he is denying Ford’s allegations outright. The real question, then, is not just whether Kavanaugh assaulted Ford as a teenager: It is whether he is telling the truth about those actions all these years later. Those of us calling for a full and fair hearing are not only interested in Kavanaugh’s alleged actions 35 years ago. We are concerned about his response to those accusations today.
        
          To be clear, Brooks makes an excellent point about the risks of holding 17-year-olds to the same standard as adults, particularly with regard to crime. The sad reality is that our criminal justice system does tend to apply unreasonable standards to minors, to devastating effect. Some states automatically try 17-year-old defendants as adults, and prosecutors in most states can charge 17-year-olds as adults with the assent of a court. As a result, teenage defendants who are not even old enough to vote are subjected to longer prison sentences in more dangerous facilities. These minors have less access to rehabilitative services and higher rates of recidivism than peers who remain in the juvenile justice system. It should come as no surprise that in some jurisdictions, racial minorities are more likely to be tried as adults than whites.
        
          The Supreme Court has placed some limits on this practice. In 2005, in Roper v. Simmons, the court prohibited the execution of defendants who committed their crime before the age of 18. Five years later, in Graham v. Florida, the court forbade a sentence of life in prison without parole for juvenile offenders who commit non-homicide offenses. In 2012’s Miller v. Alabama, the court struck down laws that required mandatory life without parole for minors upon conviction of certain crimes.
        
          These decisions have provided a vital vindication of the Constitution’s bar against “cruel and unusual punishments.” It’s also worth noting that the conservative wing of the court has consistently objected to them, often detailing the brutal crimes committed by 17-year-olds to illustrate the righteousness of life sentences for minors. “The category of murderers that the Court delicately calls ‘children’ (murderers under the age of 18),” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in Miller in 2012, “consists overwhelmingly of young men who are fast approaching the legal age of adulthood.” He described a “typical” juvenile killer “who committed a brutal thrill-killing just nine months shy of his 18th birthday” and noted: “Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of murders every year, and some of these crimes are incredibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as mature as the average 18-year-old.”
        
          That may be true. It’s also true that none of those juvenile murderers who faced a real risk of life imprisonment were wealthy white guys. The rules for rich white people (and their kids) are just different, and not only in heinous cases. While affluent families can pay an attorney to expunge their children’s criminal records, the process is almost impossible for indigent defendants in many states. A juvenile criminal record can dog an individual throughout his life, preventing him from going to college and getting a job. Prosperous parents can make this problem go away for their children. The average juvenile offender, meanwhile, is on his own.
        
          Rosa Brooks is also right that the correct response to this disparity is to level up, not down—to extend the privileges that wealthy minors already get to everybody else. Adults, she wrote, “should not be shadowed forever by misdeeds as children.” And of course they shouldn’t. So how, then, does our criminal justice system recommend we assess minors’ misdeeds with their potential to grow and change? The Supreme Court has directed judges to consider a juvenile offender’s demonstration of rehabilitation in determining whether he should be released from a life sentence. An adult who expresses remorse and requests forgiveness for his youthful crime, who apologizes to his victims and tries to better himself, deserves our empathy. One who refuses to acknowledge that he committed a crime may not.
        
          We still have much to learn about the events in question. But if Ford’s allegation is true, it seems Kavanaugh falls into this latter category, standing by a Friday statement in which he “categorically and unequivocally” denied Ford’s accusation. That means the question of whether he should receive our clemency is purely hypothetical.
        
          If senators decide that Kavanaugh did commit assault and choose to oppose him, their vote may also rest on the fact that, in their estimation, he lied about the attack. (Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, has already indicated that lying about the alleged assault, rather than the act itself, would be “disqualifying.”) It is perfectly consistent to believe that nobody’s life should be ruined for committing a crime at age 17—and that any adult who lies about that crime should not be elevated to the Supreme Court. Rejecting Kavanaugh’s confirmation on this basis wouldn’t be doling out punishment, but rather withholding a privilege.
        
          Luckily, the Senate is not a criminal court; these charges need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Senators’ only duty in assessing such appointments is to provide “advice and consent,” if they so choose. To ascertain whether Kavanaugh has earned their vote, they should not just ask if he committed assault as a teenager: They must also decide whether the nominee is being truthful today. Under these circumstances, evasion is unacceptable, and any attempt at dissimulation should be rejected. Kavanaugh must answer to these charges directly and correctly. If he does not, the Senate will have no good reason to give him its consent. And it will have more to do with his words at age 53 than his actions at age 17.

          Donald Trump is running the table. He has managed, with his Brett Kavanaugh nomination circus, to undermine the FBI, the judicial branch, the media, and the legal academy. He’s done all that while being openly malevolent and revanchist about the dignity of sexual assault survivors in America. Everything the man touches turns to garbage and it’s surely just a happy accident that the institutions—like courts and federal law enforcement—that have been arrayed against him will all come out of this Supreme Court nightmare both tarnished and diminished.
        
          Brett Kavanaugh started his campaign for the Supreme Court with a howler of a lie—he spoke straight into the camera and unflinchingly praised Donald Trump’s extensive and lengthy search for a fit nominee. And among the most intemperate howls he uttered during the spectacle that was last week was not just a conspiracy-minded claim about Democrats avenging the Clintons but also a throwaway line about a “calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.” Kavanaugh always knew he would be tarred by his association with the most corrupt and venal president in history. Last week, though, he gave up all pretense and blurted out that he was being unfairly punished for it by liberal conspiracies. Or maybe everybody associated with Trump gets the Trump ick on them. Either way, this week, when Trump stood in front of a roaring crowd in Mississippi and mocked Christine Blasey Ford, Brett Kavanaugh perhaps realized that this too will stick to Brett Kavanaugh. His devoted patron? The president? Who’s been nothing but lovely to Kavanaugh and his family? Yeah, he’s a pig.
        
          Kavanaugh, caught in falsehood after falsehood, and exonerated by an investigation that failed to investigate, has now managed, with his Trump-inspired performance of uncontrolled fury last week, to inject Trumpism directly into the Supreme Court. He has managed, in one short week, to secure the disapproval of more than 2,400 law professors, Republican appointee John Paul Stevens, the Washington Post, the ACLU, the American Bar Association, and myriad other entities that don’t take positions on Supreme Court nominations.
        
          Kavanaugh has pleaded his case for evenhanded neutrality on Fox News and in the Wall Street Journal and gritted out, over and over, that he lives on the goddamn sunrise side of the mountain and screw you, America, for thinking otherwise—that last bit a very sunrise-side-of-the-mountain position to take, by the way. Even after all that has passed, it’s hard not to contrast his conduct with that of Merrick Garland, who did not take to Fox News or the op-ed pages or anyplace else to campaign for the seat that should, by this logic, have been his. Faced with vicious multimillion-dollar ad buys that served up fabricated claims about his record, Garland sat silent. He remains silent two years later, in no small part because he understands that the Supreme Court is greater than any one man and also that any one man can break it into pieces. In the face of a yearlong vacancy, Garland said nothing, because that is what anyone who reveres the law and the Constitution would do.
        
          Kavanaugh has now forced the issue: Thousands of law professors have now taken sides, over his conduct at his hearing alone, and the court and the law will not easily recover from it. The reality show that is the Senate vote totters in the background. And Kavanaugh will join a bench on which his eight colleagues will have to endure a body blow to the prestige, independence, and integrity of the court itself, because Kavanaugh couldn’t stop himself from shouting polemical partisan conspiracy theories about the press and the Democrats to ensure his seat. No litigant will feel she is before an impartial tribunal and no law student will believe that the law is anything but bias and power. And the other eight justices? They will say nothing because they will understand better than anyone what has been lost this week.
        
          So herein a modest proposal: The eight remaining justices should vote on Kavanaugh. Let’s let them be the arbiters of whether Kavanaugh has disqualified himself, either with untruths, or partisan attacks, or with open campaigning for a seat that seems to matter to him far more than the independence and esteem of the judiciary. If the whole sorry mess of this confirmation is to be triangulated against eight jurists who are precluded from saying one word in defense of the institution on which they sit, let those jurists make the final decision. If any one of the conservative justices wishes to break ranks and vote against Kavanaugh, so be it. If any of the liberals believes he is still fit to sit with them, it would be good to learn why. If the justices split 4–4 along partisan lines, at least we will have material proof that the institution is irredeemably broken along party lines. And if the remaining eight justices truly esteem the country, the court, and the public trust more than they like any one affable man, they could let us know. And it would be awfully good to know.
        
          Please don’t tell me my solution is unconstitutional; I am well aware of its infirmities. But if the court is about to cement its status as a national joke, a football subject to power grabs and convenient moral blindness, maybe it would be best for the American people to see and hear that, and from the justices themselves. If and when Kavanaugh is sworn onto the court, the other eight justices will spend the better part of their lives trying to find institutional cover for the damage they have sustained this month. One might think they’d like to nip that in the bud, or at least to evince awareness of what’s happening. Let’s allow the eight sitting justices to confirm Kavanaugh. If they want to confirm him, we can at least say that they made the choice to hurt the court themselves.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/why-is-lisa-blatt-endorsing-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          On Tuesday, Lisa Blatt—a self-described “liberal feminist lawyer”—will endorse the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Blatt is a SCOTUS superstar who has argued 35 cases before the court, more than any other woman. She has won 32 of them, an astonishing record for any advocate. Blatt clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and frequently supports progressive litigation pro bono; in March, she filed an influential (though ultimately unsuccessful) amicus brief in opposition to Donald Trump’s travel ban. Yet she is now backing the nomination of Kavanaugh, who will surely rule against her in virtually every liberal case she brings to the court. Why?
        
          The answer is simple: Blatt works at Arnold and Porter, an elite law firm that often represents wealthy corporations. To its credit, the firm funds pro bono ventures that permit its luminaries, like Blatt, to pursue progressive causes. But it will always, always value capital over justice. The needs of its paying clients will take priority over the interests of its pro bono practice every single time. That is the cardinal rule of Big Law, and it should come as no surprise that Blatt is playing this nomination by the books.
        
          I do not mean to suggest that firms like Arnold and Porter are cynical or unscrupulous because they represent large corporations while simultaneously defending the rights of the powerless. It is entirely noble for the firm to devote a substantial portion of its immense funds to social justice groups and indigent defendants. Credit where it’s due: A&P attorneys have represented death row inmates and victims of discrimination in employment, education, and housing. Blatt herself argued a landmark case that persuaded a federal appeals court to prohibit peremptory challenges to gay jurors on the basis of their sexual orientation. The firm encourages its lawyers to devote  15 percent of their time to pro bono work, and the country is a better place for it.
        
          But these cases aren’t the bread and butter of A&P’s practice. The firm makes its money by representing corporations like BP (which A&P defended following the Deepwater Horizon spill), Exxon Mobil, Monsanto, Novartis, Pfizer, and Philip Morris. (Blatt’s own attorney profile boasts that she helped to overturned the “reinstatement of $10 billion verdict against client Philip Morris in a ‘lights’ cigarette case.”) A&P also represents businesses rather than workers in labor disputes and specializes in breaking up class actions.
        
          Kavanaugh has a long history of siding with businesses like these over consumers, employees, and the environment. And, as HuffPost’s Amanda Terkel notes, that’s good news for Blatt. While she may get (well-deserved) liberal plaudits for her work on cases like the travel ban, Blatt is better known in the elite world of appellate practice for her vigorous representation of these moneyed interests. Kavanaugh will rule against her when she represents death row inmates, LGBTQ people, abortion providers, and racial minorities. But these aren’t the cases that keep the bonuses flowing at A&P. And when she represents those clients before Kavanaugh’s court—the BPs and Philip Morrises of the world—she’ll have a reliable fifth vote in her favor.
        
          Thus, for Blatt, it is perfectly rational to sing Kavanaugh’s praises at his confirmation hearing. In her Politico article supporting him, Blatt does express a tinge of anxiety, as the “mother of a teenage girl,” that he might overturn Roe v. Wade. (He will.) But she needn’t fret too much. Even after Kavanaugh overturns Roe, people who are wealthy enough will still have the means to obtain a safe abortion in most cases. It will be lower-income women who are forced to give birth against their will or driven to the black market at the possible risk of arrest. And when prosecutors target poor women who terminate their own pregnancies, Blatt can file an amicus brief on their behalf, then lose thanks to Kavanaugh’s vote.
        
          Blatt’s testimony will likely fall along the same lines as Neal Katyal’s endorsement of Neil Gorsuch during last year’s confirmation hearings. Katyal, a partner at Hogan Lovells, alleged that Gorsuch was a principled jurist devoted to “fairness,” “decency,” and “the rule of law.” Fourteen months after he was confirmed, Gorsuch cast the decisive fifth vote upholding Trump’s travel ban against a challenge brought by … Neal Katyal.
        
          A devastating rebuke to his misguided testimony? Not really. I’m sure Katyal was genuinely disappointed by the outcome in the travel ban case. But a month earlier, Gorsuch authored the opinion in Epic Systems v. Lewis, a 5–4 ruling that allowed employers to strip their workers of the right to sue collectively. The decision was a crushing blow to labor rights that kneecapped a key New Deal reform, insulating employers who engage in wage theft from class-action lawsuits. Who represented employers in their appeal to the Supreme Court? Neal Katyal. 2018 may have been a terrible year for Muslim litigants at SCOTUS, but it was a great year for Hogan Lovells.
        
          When several people, including me, critiqued Katyal’s involvement in Epic Systems, Sean Marotta, a senior associate at Hogan Lovells, fired back. “Just as progressives are rightly outraged when conservatives suggest that public defenders contribute to crime,” he declared, “the same principles apply in the other direction. If you don’t like Epic, fine. But that’s no reason to go after my colleagues.” Does Marotta truly think that criticizing a corporate lawyer for defending labor exploitation is just as bad as condemning a criminal defense attorney for fulfilling his duties under the Sixth Amendment? Probably. This dogma is what allows extremely smart and fundamentally decent people like Marotta, Katyal, and Blatt to rationalize their (lucrative) defense of distasteful corporate abuse and support judges who will crush their pro bono clients.
        
          Many progressive advocates are furious that Blatt would stand up for a Supreme Court nominee who will undoubtedly impose his conservative ideology on the country. Their rage is understandable but misguided. Blatt was never really on their team, and they were naïve for assuming otherwise. When she testifies under the klieg lights on Tuesday, she will not be betraying her beliefs. She will simply be representing the best interests of those clients who matter the most.

SLATE,https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-georgetown-prep-revealing.html,"
          This week, the author Curtis Sittenfeld tweeted that it feels like we are now living in her 2005 novel Prep—and she did not mean it in a good way. The book is set at a fictional elite New England boarding school, a place not altogether unlike Georgetown Prep, the Maryland high school that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attended. One of the book’s major themes is its main character and narrator’s difficulty adjusting to the school’s rarified culture, and in a subsequent tweet, Sittenfeld highlighted a passage in which Prep’s narrator talked about turning to old yearbooks as a way to decipher the school’s exotic-seeming ways: “[T]hey were like an atlas for the school. … You could figure out, if you had the inclination and the time, who in a given year was friends with whom and who had dated whom, and who had been popular, or athletic, or weird and fringy.” Sittenfeld articulated something that almost anyone who’s ever paged through a yearbook can attest to, which is that there’s something transfixing about these keepsakes. I know I spent hours poring over the yearbook of a friend’s older sibling in my early teens, before I started high school and became a yearbook editor myself. For people on the outside, a yearbook can feel like a decoder ring.
        
          Now a yearbook is performing a similar act of conjuring up the past. As allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh that date back to his high school and college years have emerged, Kavanaugh’s 1983 Georgetown Prep yearbook page has become an item of public interest thanks to its references to drinking and a New York Times report that it contained veiled demeaning boasts about a purported sexual conquest.
        
          It is strange, for this former yearbook editor, to see these hardbound mementos rocket into the news cycle, and yet I am also not surprised that they would turn out to be such powerful, incriminating artifacts. The elite prep school culture that shaped Kavanaugh makes his yearbook especially relevant, but yearbooks have also figured into some other recent political narratives in less likely ways. Last fall, during Roy Moore’s campaign for an Alabama Senate seat, his yearbook inscription to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct became a key piece of evidence for both sides. Earlier this month, Caitlin Flanagan wrote a piece for the Atlantic about an experience she had in high school that was similar to the sexual assault Christine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh perpetrated, and how Flanagan forgave her attacker after he apologized to her—via a note in her yearbook.
        
          What is it about yearbooks? In the same way we assume social media trails will inevitably follow younger generations, we expect that older ones wouldn’t be so burdened, their analog ephemera lost to time. But part of why yearbooks are resurfacing is that people have dutifully held onto them, since that’s what they were designed for. Entries in them were the social media profiles of their day: We can’t scroll all the way to the beginning of Kavanaugh’s Instagram account, but we can look through his yearbook in an attempt to glean insights into what he was like as a teenager. And just as the story of a public figure’s old social media posts causing controversy has become a familiar modern narrative, the re-emergence and decoding of Kavanaugh’s yearbook page is the 20th-century version of outing a famous person’s old ill-advised tweets.
        
          Though their job is to memorialize, yearbooks are similar to social media posts in that we often end up reading them in very different contexts than they were originally created. When Kavanaugh listed himself on his yearbook page as treasurer of the “Keg City Club” (“100 Kegs or Bust”), did he ever think that the phrase would be included in the documents that would surface as he was up for a Supreme Court confirmation in the U.S. Senate? Probably not—though, as Michelle Goldberg has pointed out, it’s possible that absent the worse allegations, mere allusions to drinking heavily would have had little impact on his candidacy, not in a society where men “reap social capital for misbehaving.”
        
          But what about designating himself as a “Renate Alumnius,” another snippet from Kavanaugh’s yearbook entry? Per the Times, the “Renate” in question was not some kind of Latinate honor but a person, a girl who attended a nearby school, and Kavanaugh and his friends mentioned her to intimate that they had all been involved with her, presumably sexually. Until recently, she didn’t know about these references, which she has called “horrible, hurtful, and simply untrue.” Kavanaugh has denied that his Renate affiliation meant anything untoward, but it’s not a denial that holds much water: If it’s so harmless and uncontroversial, why was it worth putting in the yearbook in the first place? Are we to accept a feeble attempt to explain it away 30 years later, or should we read into the words we see, printed in black and white, among a bunch of other jokes about beer and drinking to excess? It’s odd to consider a school-sponsored book more trustworthy than the statements of a federal judge, but that’s where we are.
        
          Yearbooks aren’t fact-checked with the precision of the New Yorker; of course there are things in them that don’t hold up to scrutiny. They’re really exercises in self-mythologizing—how people want to be remembered, not how they were. But that doesn’t mean they don’t also contain essential truths. In Caitlin Flanagan’s case, she seems to hold up her yearbook and the note it contained as an important symbol of proof. That Flanagan started her Atlantic piece about her attempted rape quoting the apology the fellow student who attacked her wrote in her yearbook shows how meaningful it was to her. This man later apologized to Flanagan in person, and that was important too, she adds, but for her the yearbook inscription and the in-person apology both seemed like direct and verifiable evidence that this man was ultimately truly sorry. She never considers not taking him at his word—why would he write it in her yearbook if it weren’t true? And so he is fully absolved.
        
          This display of contrition stands in contrast to the smoking gun from Roy Moore’s Senate campaign, the note he wrote in the yearbook of a teenage girl who accused him of sexual misconduct, Beverly Young Nelson. Moore could deny any association with his accuser all he wanted, but she had the yearbook, and it contained a note from a man in his 30s to a then-teenage girl, and there’s really nothing anyone could say that would make that OK. Kavanaugh’s yearbook, too, can’t help but shine a light onto his privilege and his desire for male approval at the expense of women.
        
          Yearbooks weren’t intended to be read this way, for all their inside jokes to be checked out and judged against modern standards, for newspaper reporters to go through them with a fine-toothed comb. And that’s what makes them so fascinating and revealing. Plenty of Kavanaugh’s classmates have come out of the woodwork to speak to what he was like as a high school and college student, but it’s worth remembering that where memory and testimony can be unreliable, in the humble yearbook we can occasionally find a perfect character witness.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-opening-statement-christine-blasey-ford.html,"
          Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sat down in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and declared war on the Democratic Party. His statement marked a total departure from what he submitted to the committee on Wednesday, veering into an openly political attack on his opponents. It was thoroughly partisan and utterly disgraceful, a Trumpian Hail Mary that exuded desperation, entitlement, and rage.
        
          “This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” Kavanaugh said, his voice raised. “The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process. But you have replaced ‘advice and consent’ with ‘search and destroy.’ ” He took direct aim at Democrats, asserting: “Since my nomination in July, there’s been a frenzy on the left to come up with something, anything to block my confirmation.” He continued:
        
          “You sowed the wind,” he admonished Democratic senators, and now “the country will reap the whirlwind.”
        
          Kavanaugh denounced “Democratic members of this committee,” calling their behavior during his earlier hearings “an embarrassment.” He accused them of “lying in wait” to spring false accusations upon him when “it looked like I might actually get confirmed.” He described “this whole two-week effort” as “a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.” He alleged that this effort was driven by “revenge on behalf of the Clintons”—a reference to his tenure as a prosecutor on Ken Starr’s team during the 1990s—“and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.” He insisted he was the victim of “grotesque character assassination.”
        
          Indeed, that was the theme of Kavanaugh’s testimony: that he is the victim, that Democrats and Clinton allies are engaged in a conspiracy to destroy his nomination and reputation. He demanded sympathy, crying and yelling in turn. “I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,” he said. “You may defeat me in the final vote, but you’ll never get me to quit.”
        
          This remarkable performance was impassioned, entrancing, and absolutely inappropriate. Kavanaugh dropped any pretense of non-partisanship. He came out swinging as a Republican, as a man who loathes the Democratic Party just as much as the president who nominated him loathes it. He abandoned any effort to obtain Democratic votes and instead appealed directly to Republican senators: Don’t let these monsters stop me from getting what I deserve. Not even Clarence Thomas descended to this level of raw political fisticuffs when fighting Anita Hill’s allegations. If, after Thursday’s testimony, Kavanaugh is still confirmed to the Supreme Court, there will be no question whose bidding he will do on the bench.

          Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jamie was murdered during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida earlier this year, says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh refused to shake his hand when he approached before the lunch break at Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Tuesday. Much like the size of the crowd at Donald Trump’s inauguration, the facts of the incident quickly became contested ground, as the Trump administration offered their own interpretation of events captured on camera. Guttenberg gave his account of what happened on Twitter:
        
          Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah had a different take, calling Guttenberg an “unidentified individual” who “the Judge” would have shaken hands with, if not for overzealous security guards:
        
          Guttenberg immediately disputed Shah’s version on Twitter, which would have created an intractable Rashomon-type scenario, if not for the fact that their exchange was captured on video from multiple angles. Decide for yourself: Does this show a Supreme Court nominee realizing with alarm that he’s talking to a citizen who disagrees with his beliefs about gun control, then whirling away and rushing off without shaking hands, or does it show a Supreme Court nominee whose eagerness to extend his condolences, father to father, was unfortunately interrupted by security? First, here’s the version Raj Shah tweeted:
        
          It’s strange that Shah chose an extreme long shot, in which the interaction between Guttenberg and Kavanaugh is barely discernable, but maybe it’s the only angle from which the gunman on the grassy knoll is visible. CNN was less coy:
        
          The Washington Post captured the exchange from a slightly different angle, which shows more of Kavanaugh’s facial expressions. Guttenberg can be heard saying “… was murdered at Parkland,” then, more loudly, saying “Walking away? Have a nice day,” as Kavanaugh walks away from him:
        
          NBC News captured Guttenberg’s facial expressions from an angle that makes it clear Kavanaugh ignored his handshake and turned away after he said “I’m Fred Guttenberg” but possibly before he mentioned his daughter’s murder (although there’s an inaudible sentence in between):
        
          Guttenberg, who was there as a guest of California Senator Dianne Feinstein, later told CNN he’d gone to talk to Kavanaugh “as a dad,” adding, “I don’t go home to my complete family anymore.”
        
          Finally, Paramount Pictures—normally not in the business of covering Supreme Court confirmation hearings—had no footage of Guttenberg and Kavanaugh, but were able to capture the moment when senatorial candidate Greg Stillson used a baby as a human shield at a rally in New Hampshire:
        
          So it looks like it’s one of those intractable Rashomon-type scenarios after all. The only possible way to determine whether what happened between Kavanaugh and Guttenberg was a snub or an accident would be to somehow measure the relative credibility of Guttenberg, who has dedicated his life to the cause of gun safety after the murder of his teenage daughter, against that of Shah, a man who voluntarily took a job working for Donald Trump. It’s a real pickle!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford-testify-senate.html,"
          This post has been updated with recent news developments.
        
          As a growing number of legislators call for more information about a recent allegation accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in the 1980s, both the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, and Kavanaugh himself have said they were willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          On Monday, Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican whose vote has the potential to ensure or block Kavanaugh’s confirmation, expressed a desire Monday to hear from both parties:
        
          Collins has until now appeared likely to vote to confirm Kavanaugh. She joined fellow Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, and Bob Corker in calling for the testimony.
        
          On Monday morning, a lawyer representing Ford, the California professor who accused Kavanaugh of attempting to rape her when the two were in high school, said on NBC’s Today show on Monday that her client was willing to testify. Later in the day, Kavanaugh announced he would be willing to talk to the committee about the accusations, according to the New York Times.
        
          Also speaking on Monday, Kellyanne Conway said in an interview on Fox & Friends that, though the White House still believed Kavanaugh to be “a man of character and integrity,” Ford should be allowed to testify and “should be heard.”
        
          The statements came a day after Ford stepped forward publicly in an interview with the Washington Post. Ford had written a confidential letter about her allegations to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said she would honor Ford’s request for anonymity and passed the letter on to the FBI, which in turn sent a redacted version to the White House to be included in Kavanaugh’s background file.  As buzz around the letter grew, Ford came to believe she would be identified by reporters, and on Sunday, she decided to come forward publicly.
        
          In the interview, Ford alleged that in the early 1980s, at a house in suburban Maryland, Kavanaugh and a friend cornered her in a bedroom. Kavanaugh, who she said was very drunk, pinned her to a bed and groped her and grinded against her while the friend watched. Kavanaugh tried to pull off her swimsuit, she said, and when she tried to scream, he covered her mouth with his hand. She said she was able to flee when the friend jumped on them, causing enough chaos to allow her to escape.
        
          Ford’s attorney said Monday that while her client was “willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth,” she did not have a position on Kavanaugh’s nomination and was not politically motivated.
        
          In a statement Monday, the White House reiterated its support for Kavanaugh. “On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation,’” a White House spokeswoman said. “This has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.”

          It is a remarkable fact of American life that hordes of men are now defending sexual assault. It’s not immediately clear why. It seems like the very definition of an unforced error. But a substantial group, many of them in politics, has taken to the internet to argue that a 17-year-old football player should get to do as he likes to a 15-year-old girl—say, for example, trap her in a bedroom, violently attempt to remove her clothes, and cover her mouth to muffle her screams—without consequences to his life or reputation. The “locker room” once invoked to normalize Trump’s language (every man talks this way behind closed doors!) has expanded into a locked American bedroom with a woman trapped inside. It’s all in good fun, defenders declare. Horseplay.
        
          Here’s the most surprising part: They’ve launched this peculiar defense despite the fact that the accused party denies it ever happened.
        
          To be clear, there are perfectly feasible defenses of Brett Kavanaugh that others have attempted. One could respond to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he assaulted her at a party while they were teenagers by saying (as some have) that we can’t know the facts or that more evidence is needed. But no: This group has opted instead to defend male impunity for sexual assault and frame a woman’s story of coping with years of trauma as a true crisis … for men. A White House lawyer was quoted saying, “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried.” Similar things were voiced by Ari Fleischer and Joe Walsh. Per this dark vision of the future, any consequence for committing assault—even being unable to move from one lifetime appointment to another lifetime appointment—is the beginning of the end of a just society.
        
          There is a corollary, and it is that teenage girls should not expect justice for coming forward—which Ford had been rightly reluctant to do: “Even if true, teenagers!” tweeted Minnesota state Sen. Scott Newman, summoning a vision of American adolescence where being trapped and attacked is a boisterous fact of life. (He added, however, that he did not believe Ford.) Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Lance Morrow minimized the victim’s side of things further by declaring that the incident wasn’t serious enough to matter. “The thing happened—if it happened—an awfully long time ago, back in Ronald Reagan’s time. … No clothes were removed, and no sexual penetration occurred.” What’s a little assault—or fearing for your life and having to fight free and hide—if no penises made insertions and the Gipper was in charge?
        
          This trend isn’t really that mysterious, of course. The reason for this panicked defense of assault—even as Kavanaugh continues to firmly deny it—is fear. Not fear that the system will punish men wrongly but that it will punish them rightly. Sure, they will legalistically argue that the rules have changed on them, and it’s true to a point that things were different in 1982: “Date rape” wasn’t yet an available concept, meaning that women had no way of describing the peculiar horror of being sexually assaulted by someone they knew. But the times weren’t quite as different as these guys like to pretend they were. Just because there was no socially validated vocabulary for a man forcing an acquaintance to have sex against her will did not, in any way, mean that the man thought what he was doing was just fine. Men are not idiots. As Caitlin Flanagan recounts in an essay, a high school boy who tried to rape her and then stopped later sought her out to apologize. Why? Because he understood perfectly well that what he’d tried to do was monstrous. Sure, high-schoolers can have misunderstandings, but holding a high school girl down and muffling her screams is not a case of mixed signals. People understood that. Yes, even under Reagan.
        
          But they sure got to pretend they didn’t. “Boys will be boys” is a nostrum with the designated purpose of chalking male malfeasance up to innocent high spirits. It’s a saying that meant to exonerate, but here’s the funny thing: It only works on the agreed-upon assumption that boys do shitty things, the gravity of which we’re supposed to ignore or dismiss. The message isn’t that the boys don’t know that the things they do are bad; it’s rather that the rest of us should forgive, understand, and love them anyway, without their needing to ask for it.
        
          Is it any surprise that an incentive structure like this one breeds entitled indifference to girls and women in the coddled party, and in the system that coddles them? Is it any surprise that men would panic at the realization that the system that they could depend on to look the other way is fast eroding?
        
          We knew this moment would arrive when the #MeToo movement began. It was clear that men and women were universally comfortable with the movement as long as its targets were unregenerate monsters like Harvey Weinstein, and it was just as clear that the tides would shift once attention expanded to the scope of what women routinely put up with. Eventually, as I wrote then, there would be an attempt to “naturalize sexual harassment. If there are this many men doing these things, then surely this is just how men are!”
        
          But I never imagined it would get this explicit. I never thought I would see a group that has spent years laughing at the very idea of anything like “rape culture” suddenly not just admitting that it exists but arguing that it should—nothing should be done about it; male malfeasance is an unstoppable cocktail of culture and biology. The subtext—stripped of all chivalric pretense thanks to the recent panic—is that victims don’t matter. They’re invisible because they’re unimportant, and women’s pain is irrelevant.
        
          In contrast, during these past few weeks, nothing has been presented as more crucially central than men’s pain. Almost as if they’d planned it, a clutch of disgraced men who were finally exposed for years of ongoing alleged abuse has been creeping back toward their long-lamented spotlight. There are quite a few. These reputationally injured parties range from Jian Ghomeshi and John Hockenberry to Louis C.K. to Bryan Singer. What they share—besides a history of inflicting their sexual attentions on the less powerful because they felt like it—is an itch to be famous once again. They want their timeouts to be over. They have suffered, they believe, and they wish us to know it. This should be laughable: Anyone who assaulted or harassed someone and escaped without a record should be thanking their lucky stars. Their minimal privation mostly consists of being economically comfortable and doing without attention for 10 or 11 months. But it’s not laughable! They mean it. They grew up in a world that taught them they “get to” do the things they did. They feel, accordingly, that they have been unjustly penalized. They believe they’re suffering greatly.
        
          And many of us (I include myself) are almost—almost—persuaded. Many of us have been trained from birth to believe that men (unlike women) are long-suffering and stoic. That means that their pain, when they do express it, strikes us as almost holy. It took me decades to realize that something like the opposite is true: It’s not that men’s pain isn’t real; it’s that our culture vastly overestimates it. A certain kind of man not getting exactly what he wants, precisely when he wants it, will truly believe he’s suffering more than a woman in pain who has never been told that what she wants might matter. While this doesn’t make him a liar, it does limit him and blind him to those limits.
        
          It’s as if men and women have different pain scales emotionally as well as physically. Of course men believe they suffer more, and many women—having spent their lives accustomed to men’s feelings mattering more than everyone else’s—will agree with them. Most of us have been socialized to sympathize with men, the troubled geniuses, the heroes and antiheroes. They’re the protagonists. And this meritocratic American dream stuff (which, let’s face it, is 100 percent pitched as male) has a poetry that encourages pity. If men on that journey experience a setback, their plight scans as injustice (the American dream does not reverse!). Their suffering must, therefore, be more acute.
        
          The point of all this is that “he said, she said” accounts aren’t the empty contradictions we often dismiss them as; they can tell us quite a bit about the different realities in which men and women get to live. We think of these testimonies as being equally valid, even if they’re at odds. (Kidding: We usually assume that the woman has somehow exaggerated or misremembered or misread the context or lied: “I think she’s mistaking something, but I don’t know, I mean, I don’t know her,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Ford.) We don’t question the particulars of someone’s account of their mugging, but rape inspires people to start panning the story for possible “misunderstandings.” But given all of the above, there is, actually, a decent explanation for this: The painful experiences claimed by women make no impression at all on a certain kind of man’s sense of reality. Her perspective is as unreal as it is inconsequential to him. Result: His and her story can be, in a limited and horrifying sense, equally true. It’s believable, in other words, that Ford says she was scarred by the attack and dealt with it in therapy decades later. It’s also believable that Kavanaugh pal Mark Judge “has no recollection” of being in the room while Kavanaugh allegedly attacked her—not because he was drunk (though he has a history) but because this incident with a struggling screaming teen girl might be, to him, too unremarkable to remember.
        
          It would be great if this appalling imbalance had been “fixed” by #MeToo in 11 short months. But if anything, the hysterical hypercorrection among men has combined our habitual sympathy for them with a plea to extend their exceptionalism. They’re finally just willing to say what was once held in common: Women aren’t full citizens whose bodily autonomy and personal liberty matters. The harm to a woman isn’t worth punishing anyone over as long as you get yours. Convicted rapist Brock Turner was defended by his father on precisely these grounds: He should get probation, because jail time would be “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.” (Note that the human person Turner attacked literally does not factor into this perspective.) Fox News columnist Stephen Miller reclassified the Kavanaugh accusation as “drunk teenagers playing seven minutes of heaven”—a game where the girl typically both consents and voluntarily participates, but is all that really necessary anyway?
        
          It’s useful to have naked misogyny out in the open. It is now clear, and no exaggeration at all, that a significant percentage of men—most of them Republicans—believe that a guy’s right to a few minutes of “action” justifies causing people who happen to be women physical pain, lifelong trauma, or any combination of the two. They’ve decided—at a moment when they could easily have accepted Kavanaugh’s denial—that something larger was at stake: namely, the right to do as they please, freely, regardless of who gets hurt. Rather than deny male malfeasance, they’ll defend it. Their logic could not be more naked or more self-serving: Men should get to escape consequences for youthful “indiscretions” like assault, but women should not—especially if the consequence is a pregnancy. And this perspective extends 100 percent to the way they wish the legal system to work: Harms suffered by women do not rate consideration, much less punishment. (I recommend Googling the mortality rate for women when abortion was illegal.)
        
          As if that weren’t bad enough, this recent spate of attempted rehabilitations casts into sharp relief how little men socialized to think this way care—still—about the women (and men) they’ve harmed. The men exposed by #MeToo are testing the waters for their planned return with a surprise performance here, a profile there, perhaps a giant self-regarding essay in a high-profile magazine. Some have offered to shade in their experience of disgrace as if they were tragic heroes rather than prurient narcissists. Read those and search for any sign, however slight, that they’ve given their alleged victims’ pain one-tenth of the consideration that they’ve given their own. Perhaps they erred, but what more do we want from them? Haven’t they endured enough?
        
          The answer is no.

SLATE,https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/10/ashley-kavanaugh-body-language-swearing-in-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh’s ceremonial swearing-in at the White House this week was a moment of triumph for many conservatives, and agony for liberals who opposed him. There was no reason to assume it wasn’t a joyful day for Kavanaugh and his family. But some viewers speculated otherwise, upon examining a brief clip of Kavanaugh’s wife, Ashley, that was broadcast by Fox News.
        
          The clip captures Ashley leaning in to receive a kiss on the cheek from her husband; at one point Kavanaugh nudges her backward so he can hug one of his daughters, and later she briefly raises her eyebrows while he rubs her back. That’s it.
        
          But to resistance tweeters, it was something much more sinister. The above tweet racked up more than 79,000 retweets and a chorus of expanded analyses pinpointing in Ashley Kavanaugh not a proud wife, but one who is annoyed, repulsed, or even abused. “Did you see that look of fear in her eyes when he squeezed her shoulder? The warning sign between the two of them.” “The way she keeps looking at him—not romantically, but guardedly.” “The oldest daughter knows. It’s written all over her face.” Another “expert” spun a long theory about how Kavanaugh’s stance at her husband’s formal swearing-in—including her possibly turned-in toes—signifies “lower confidence and the need for protection.”
        
          Amateur marital-body-language analysis is a long-standing cultural pastime. That image of Silda Spitzer grimacing alongside her disgraced husband during a press conference became so iconic that it surely helped inspire the pilot of The Good Wife. But it now seems like everyone on the internet has become an expert at parsing stray grimaces and glares from the wives of controversial men in assorted news footage. Take, for instance, the moment Melania Trump’s smile soured when her husband turned away from her at his inauguration, and the time she flicked his hand away on a tarmac in Tel Aviv.
        
          In Ashley Kavanaugh’s case, as with Melania’s, the essential hope seems to be that body language will somehow reveal that these women secretly detest their husbands. In the latter instance, there sure seems to be plenty of evidence that the Trump marriage is in bad shape. But here’s another way of interpreting the 45-second clip at the White House this week: Ashley Kavanaugh is standing next to the president of the United States on national television, trying to make sure she and her two young daughters stand in the right place, move at the right time, and look in the right direction for photographs. What human being, especially someone unaccustomed to cameras, would not betray flickers of awkwardness on her face in that setting? For that matter, what human being would not betray flickers of awkwardness in any setting, if you stare at their face for long enough?
        
          Meanwhile, here’s what we know about Ashley Kavanaugh, no speculation necessary. She sat beside her husband as he defended himself against sexual assault allegations on Fox News, where she bolstered sympathy for him by talking about how difficult the process has been for their children. She also positioned herself behind him throughout his hearings—although her facial expressions in that setting, too, have been analyzed for proof that she was actually appalled by his bitter shouting. It would be comforting to believe that Ashley Kavanaugh secretly loathes her husband as much as liberals do. But it’s surely delusional and unproductive to project that onto this marriage when the only real evidence is a stray flick of an eyebrow.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-hearing-democrats-blew-it.html,"
          Because Republicans control the Senate Judiciary Committee, and overwhelmingly want to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Thursday’s hearing over Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation of sexual assault against the judge was structured to disadvantage Democrats at every turn. Against her wishes, Ford was compelled to testify first, allowing Kavanaugh to rebut her and denying Democrats the opportunity to question her about his testimony. Democrats were also not permitted to question Mark Judge, Kavanaugh’s high school friend who allegedly participated in the assault. And, worst of all, each senator had just five minutes to ask questions of both witnesses. That’s hardly enough time for a substantive interrogation of Kavanaugh, a master filibusterer who supplemented every statement with confrontational bluster.
        
          In light of these restraints, Democrats could have played their hand strategically. They could have allowed a handful of senators to ask all their questions, much like Republican senators brought in an outside prosecutor to question Ford. They could have coordinated their queries so that each senator focused on one area where Kavanaugh’s credibility is dubious. Or they could have carefully examined the accusations and asked piercing questions that might force Kavanaugh to provide something other than a flat denial.
        
          But they did none of that. Instead, the Democrats fixated on objections to the process—most notably, the lack of an FBI investigation into Ford’s claims—and repeated the same bad questions over and over again. It was a wasted opportunity that let Kavanaugh walk away without clarifying the major problems with his side of the story.
        
          Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member, got off to a weak start by failing to lay out the precise circumstances under which she, and the public, learned of Ford’s allegations. This oversight allowed Republicans to malign her as a leaker by insinuating that she or one of her staffers strategically hid the letter, then leaked it to the press at the last moment. Only at the end of the hearing did Feinstein neutralize this talking point, explaining that she had delayed acting on the letter because Ford requested confidentiality, and that neither she nor her staff leaked it. (The Intercept’s Ryan Grim, who first reported on the letter, confirmed this.) Had the senator laid these facts out at the beginning of the hearing, her colleagues could’ve rebutted Republicans by noting that Feinstein had simply honored her constituent’s wishes, and that it was the GOP that was rushing the confirmation process rather than permitting time for a real investigation.
        
          To be sure, such an investigation would’ve helped to gauge the truth of Ford’s claims. An FBI interrogation of Mark Judge, for instance, would reveal a great deal more than his brief statement to the committee. But it is also apparent that Republicans will not solicit the aid of the FBI. Why, then, did a majority of Democratic senators ask Kavanaugh to demand one? What, exactly, were these appeals supposed to accomplish? Even if Kavanaugh called Donald Trump at Thursday’s hearing and pleaded for an investigation—as Sen. Dick Durbin more or less asked—the president would say no. And then what? Kavanaugh made clear in his opening remarks that he would not withdraw. Democrats’ fixation on his refusal to insist on an FBI investigation barely undermines his credibility—when their chief goal on Thursday should’ve been calling his candor into doubt.
        
          Here are some of the topics that Democrats could’ve focused on—but inexplicably didn’t—that might have actually sowed uncertainty about the nominee’s veracity:
        
          • Did Kavanaugh speak with his good friend Ed Whelan about Whelan’s outrageous theory of mistaken identity, which blamed Ford’s alleged assault on a classmate? If not, who did Kavanaugh talk to about the mistaken-identity hypothesis? The Washington Post has reported that he discussed it with “allies.” Which ones?
        
          • Does Kavanaugh know who fed the name of one of his high school classmates to Whelan before Whelan tweeted out his theory? Whelan, who didn’t go to high school in or near Washington, somehow ended up with the name of someone in Kavanaugh’s social circle who looked somewhat like him and lived in the area where Ford said the assault occurred. How? Was Kavanaugh aware of the plan to smear his classmate?• What did Kavanaugh mean when he claimed that Ford’s accusation against him had been “coordinated” by Democrats and left-wing interest groups? This question would have been difficult for him to answer because it wasn’t “coordinated”; Ford brought her accusation to the Washington Post and to the attention of Congress on her own. The only person to pursue this line of questioning was Sen. Cory Booker, who did so quite effectively. His interrogation was the moment Kavanaugh looked most cornered, and it should not have stood alone.• Why did Kavanaugh say that no entry on his detailed July 1982 calendar matched Ford’s description of the party at which she was allegedly assaulted? The calendar states that Kavanaugh went “to Timmy’s for skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi” on July 1, 1982, squarely within the time frame put forth by Ford. She also identified “PJ” (a man named Patrick Smyth) and Judge as being present at the party—before seeing Kavanaugh’s calendar. Doesn’t this July 1 gathering thus fit Ford’s account quite neatly?
        
          • Why did Kavanaugh repeatedly and falsely claim that he had been accused of being in a “gang”? Presumably, he was referring to Julie Swetnick’s allegation that he associated with boys who took advantage of intoxicated women, including through “gang rapes.” Was he aware of any classmates who engaged in such behavior? If not, how does he explain a claim by Judge’s ex-girlfriend that Judge said he “and the other boys [took] turns having sex with a drunk woman”?
        
          These oversights are inexcusable, as was Democrats’ willingness to let Kavanaugh manipulate the narrative to depict himself as a victim. They should have oriented their questions around Ford’s central claim—that Kavanaugh shouldn’t be on the Supreme Court because he allegedly attempted to rape her—and on framing her disclosure accurately as the act of a concerned private citizen who felt obligated to speak up. Instead, they allowed Kavanaugh to turn Ford into an almost peripheral figure to his story of victimhood.
        
          Obviously, it is not Democrats who are attempting to push Kavanaugh toward a lifetime Supreme Court appointment in the face of credible sexual assault allegations. The blame for this disaster cannot be laid at their feet. But their questions on Thursday did remarkably little to help Ford stop Kavanaugh, which was, of course, Democrats’ goal. Their bumbling, repetitive inquiries largely left her to fend for herself.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-accusation-timing.html,"
          “But why did she wait so long?” A woman came forward Sunday with credible and specific claims about an alleged sexual assault she suffered at the hands of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when she was 15 and he was 17. And that was the principal objection raised: that her timing, and the timing of Senate Democrats, is the material issue here.
        
          Christine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University who teaches in a consortium with Stanford University, came forward in the Washington Post as the previously anonymous woman whose story surfaced last week. She claims to have been attacked by Kavanaugh and a classmate at a high school party in the 1980s. In her account to the Post, she explained that while she had chosen not to publicly accuse him, she had been forced to do so after her story, which she had shared with her congresswoman in late July, was leaked to the media. Reporters were staking out her place of work and showing up at her house.
        
          Senate Democrats have called for an airing of her claims on the merits. Some of their Republican colleagues have now joined them—Sen. Jeff Flake was the first on Sunday to say that the vote ought to be delayed. But the prevailing reaction from Senate Republicans was to dismiss her allegations as strategic and cynical and too late. Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued a statement in which he seemed to claim that Ford was untruthful, based solely in the timing of the revelations: “It raises a lot of questions about Democrats’ tactics and motives to bring this to the rest of the committee’s attention only now rather than during these many steps along the way. … Senator Feinstein should publicly release the letter she received back in July so that everyone can know what she’s known for weeks.” (CNN has released a redacted version.)
        
          Sen. Lindsey Graham released a statement agreeing to at least hear Ford’s claims, while still disputing her decision to wait until the last minute to come forward. Sen. Susan Collins echoed this sentiment: “What is puzzling to me is the Democrats, by not bringing this out earlier, after having had this information for more than six weeks, have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,” she told the New York Times on Sunday night. “If they believed Professor Ford, why didn’t they surface this information earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didn’t believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it is was handled.”
        
          Why do women wait until the last possible second to speak out about sexual harassment and assault claims? This is exactly the line of questioning Senate Republicans used to smear Anita Hill back when she testified against Clarence Thomas. Why didn’t she lodge these complaints until he was poised to sit on the highest court of the land, given that he had previously been appointed to prestigious positions?
        
          It’s a funny question. It’s actually related to the question I asked last week, which was: Why do women come forward with these claims at all? The prevailing Republican argument seems to be that if a woman was truly the victim of a violent act of sexual aggression, she ought to have reported it the very instant it happened, so the decision to wait to report it on the eve of a Senate Judiciary Committee vote clearly represents craven dirty tricks.
        
          Here’s one problem with that analysis: It’s only the “eleventh hour” because Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell have decided this hearing needs to happen at light speed. Indeed, the pacing apparently necessitated withholding the vast majority of the nominee’s records from the National Archives, which they argued was fine because the documents were being vetted by a friend of the nominee’s. In fact, the same need for lightning speed required that Kavanaugh be rushed through the process so quickly that it necessitated tens of thousands of pages of documents to be sent to the full committee the night before confirmation hearings began.
        
          The definition of power must include the power to set the timetable in which facts are discernible, and Senate Republicans, who held a Supreme Court seat open for almost a year, are now unwilling to hold one open for three months. The reason the eleventh hour wasn’t, say, the third hour is entirely because the timetable has been set by those who wanted to short-circuit meaningful scrutiny. So the complaint that it’s too late in the process is hard to swallow.
        
          That is one reason why complaints about Ford’s timing ring hollow. But here is the deeper reason why women don’t publicly report their assaults until the last possible instant and until they absolutely have to: Women who are victims start the clock at the moment of their trauma. Men who are perpetrators start it at the moment they are caught.
        
          The entire history of women complaining about sexual assault has been recorded on men’s time. In case you’re interested, here is what it looks like from women’s perspectives: They are attacked. They wait. They persuade themselves they deserved it or asked for it. They try to shift along. They tell a partner, or they tell a spouse. They tell a therapist. They tell their parents and maybe their friends. They must weigh, at every step, the likelihood of being dismissed, as Ford is now being dismissed, as a liar and a hysteric. This is a trauma that they may carry around for years, burying it and excavating it and hiding it again. They debate speaking up. They realize what happens when they speak up, by watching what happens when other women speak up. They make little deals with themselves in which they promise that if the man ever is poised to do real harm to others, they will surely speak up.
        
          Why don’t women come forward on the very day it happens? Because they have friends and hopes and dreams and confusion and alcohol and hope and every Hollywood movie ever. Because for a very long time, it’s not worth the cost.
        
          In Ford’s case, the decision to come forward on the record in September was not an active choice but instead the result of a position she was forced into after her anonymous account was made public against her will. Consider Ford’s explanation to the Post:
        
          It’s also important to be very specific about what is actually coming out now, in this so-called eleventh hour. Because the allegation is not new—it is simply new to us. Ford sent a letter detailing her story to her congresswoman in late July. The Post story notes that she also sent a tip to the paper itself in early July: “Though Ford had contacted The Post, she declined to speak on the record for weeks as she grappled with concerns about what going public would mean for her and her family—and what she said was her duty as a citizen to tell the story.” This woman has been grappling with her story, and whether and how she should tell it, for months and for years. For her, this event started when she was 15 and unspooled over years of revelation, medical help, and ambivalence from those in power.
        
          For the men who commit these acts, the clock starts never. Consider Brett Kavanaugh’s statement on the matter, released Monday morning: “This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.” For most of their lives, what they may have done never even occurs to them.They were drunk. Or they forgot. Or they were alone. Or they were in a group. And people will cover and apologize and excuse them. People will say, “Thirty-five years ago? He was a child.” And they will forget that 35 years ago, she was also a child—except that she has lugged this around on her back for decades and only got brave enough to tell anyone six years ago.
        
          Most of the women I know spent Sunday afternoon recalling a time a man grabbed her at a party and covered her mouth and rubbed against her. It happens so damn often than we all have the same story. But we didn’t report it in real time because that’s just what it is, and boys will be boys, and also we will soon learn that if we come to report it in men’s time, we will be told we were too late. We are all always too late, because if we really were worried about these types of transgressions, we would have had the wherewithal to stop them before they even happened. Once you have become a victim, you are already too late.
        
          For victims, time splits open on the day of the assault. For the accused, time splits open on the day they are named. And yet again, as was the case for Anita Hill, the power to decide when something is “too late” to matter is apparently in the hands of the same people who have the power to set the timetable, and those people do not seem to have a good understanding of trauma. Let me say it yet again: I have no idea what happened to Ford in the 1980s and what part Kavanaugh may have played, but I am inclined to believe that if she reported it in 2012 to a therapist, it cannot be said that she made it up just yesterday or even last July. That women report assaults by powerful men at all remains difficult to comprehend, and attacks on Ford that began before she was even named show why. That women who eventually do report such assaults do not do so in a time frame that is convenient for powerful men says far more about who sets the schedule than who is telling the truth.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-and-alex-kozinski-we-deserve-his-answers.html,"
          On Tuesday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will begin his confirmation hearings. Senators will have a chance to ask the nominee whatever questions they think will help them understand what kind of judge he has been on the federal appeals court and what kind of justice he will become as he takes his lifetime appointment on the highest bench in our country. Most predict he is a lock to be confirmed.
        
          Several committee Democrats say they plan to ask Judge Kavanaugh what he knew about the juvenile and predatory behavior his former boss and longtime colleague, Alex Kozinski, directed toward women for at least three decades from the federal bench. It’s a relevant question, considering that the nominee clerked for Judge Kozinski in 1990–91 and later served with him on a judicial selection committee to pick law clerks for Justice Anthony Kennedy. And it’s a particularly timely one, because Kozinski, who retired in December after the allegations surfaced, was never formally investigated and is routinely described in terms of “alleged” misconduct, since no formal findings have ever occurred, nor will they. As we watch men who have been credibly accused of serious sexual misconduct plot their returns to positions of power, it is of course relevant to consider how the legal world—the one ostensibly responsible for adjudicating harassment and predation in our society—is handling the problem within its own ranks.
        
          The reality is that our judiciary has not really had to decide how to handle this problem. There have been task forces dedicated to preventing future occurrences, but there has been no formal investigation into Kozinski’s past actions. In December, after the allegations became public, he released a statement saying: “I treat all of my employees as family and work very closely with most of them. I would never intentionally do anything to offend anyone and it is regrettable that a handful have been offended by something I may have said or done.” His retirement announcement reiterated the sentiment that making anyone uncomfortable “was never his intent.”
        
          To reiterate: There never will be an inquiry on the record, and Kozinski will continue to receive his government-funded pension. And because journalism will never provide a conclusive substitute for due process and fact finding, the women who suffered at the hands of Alex Kozinski, like my friends Emily Murphy, Leah Litman, Heidi Bond, and Kathy Ku, must continue to use the fuzzy language of “allegations” when they talk about the abuse they or their colleagues experienced on their path to joining the legal world. As I wrote in December describing my own experiences with the judge, he had a specifically disorienting way of making it feel like he wasn’t crossing any lines, because he insisted that such lines didn’t even exist.
        
          I, for one, am curious to hear what the nominee thinks of this state of affairs. Should there have been a hearing? What does it mean that the branch of government tasked with fact finding and rendering judgement has no conclusions to offer in this matter?
        
          It’s particularly interesting because the White House is clearly of the opinion that Judge Kavanaugh is a champion of women. In July, it sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee signed by 18 of Kavanaugh’s female former clerks attesting to “our uniformly positive experiences with the judge as a boss on issues of gender and equality in the workplace.” Indeed, in his speech on the night he accepted Trump’s nomination, Kavanaugh claimed that “My law clerks come from diverse backgrounds and points of view. I am proud that a majority of my law clerks have been women.”
        
          In July, the women’s rights group UltraViolet issued a call for an inquiry into what Kavanaugh might have seen as a law clerk to Kozinski from 1990–91. This was an entirely reasonable request, given that for many of us, it was hard to sit on a panel or go to a dinner with Judge Kozinski and his law clerks without seeing or hearing some form of hypersexualized grotty dinner theater. In response to this request, the White House issued a statement. Rather than answer the question, it decided to take the approach of labeling this request an “attack,” attempting to “smear” the nominee, before noting:
        
          In mid-July, perhaps to pre-empt any questions about what Judge Kavanaugh knew about the Kozinski claims, the White House came out with a remarkable blanket claim that stated flatly that Judge Kavanaugh “had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment regarding Kozinski until recently.”
        
          Perhaps this is true. In the months since Kozinski stepped down, it’s become fashionable in some circles to cast doubt on the credibility of his (many) accusers. But at a minimum, the hearings that will open Tuesday offer a perfectly reasonable venue for asking Kavanaugh to elaborate on whether he believes his former boss and mentor, or the women who stepped forward last year. It provides Kavanaugh the opportunity to expand on whether he thinks the lack of formal investigation is a cause for concern, given the volume of accounts and the credibility of the women who have brought the accusations.
        
          Perhaps unsurprisingly, the White House took the needless step of trotting out former Kozinski clerks and interns to make statements that the disgraced former judge was not inappropriate with females in his chambers. Exhibit 1 was Leslie Fahrenkopf Foley, a summer extern in Kozinski’s chambers while Kavanaugh served as a law clerk, who issued the statement: “It was a completely professional environment, and I never saw or experienced any harassment, nor did I ever feel uncomfortable.” Former 2001 Kozinski clerk Susan Engel made the same point to the Daily Caller: “At no time during my clerkship, or in the years since, did I see or hear Judge Kozinski sexually harass anyone. I was shocked by the allegations that surfaced last year. I would be astonished if Brett Kavanaugh had ever heard anything about this.”
        
          It is depressing that it still has to be said, but: Testimonials from women—especially powerful women—do not exculpate accused harassers. As Heidi Bond has noted elsewhere, the fact that Alex Kozinski didn’t comment on Sandra Day O’Connor’s breasts each time he saw her doesn’t mean he didn’t do the same to the staff around him who weren’t powerful.
        
          Let’s be precise and call that latter move what it is: The White House used the absence of any formal findings of fact about the many allegations advanced to counter the complainants who came forward last year. Judge Kavanaugh most certainly does not want to be asked by the Senate Judiciary Committee whether he believes all of the Kozinski accusers are liars. Now that is what he will be asked. To be sure, a confirmation hearing is almost as clumsy a process for getting to the bottom of these questions as is journalism, which is why there should be a meaningful process. But it falls to Kavanaugh, the nominee, to pick his way through it.
        
          If Judge Kavanaugh claims to be a mentor and booster of women, his supporters should be extremely careful about even implicitly tarnishing the women who came forward in good faith with truthful complaints. Shaming accusers into silence is not the method or practice of the American justice system. I believe Judge Kavanaugh has worked hard in service of fair courts. He should not be confirmed on the backs and reputations of the good women who have worked equally hard to the same end. I believe these women are telling the truth, and I imagine many of you do as well. That they were not afforded a process to test their claims does not make them liars. Let Kavanaugh defend what he knew or didn’t know at his hearings. But insult and undermine the Kozinski accusers at the peril of the judiciary and due process itself. This has nothing to do with what Kavanaugh should have known or should have done decades ago. It has everything to do with what he knows and intends to do about it now.

SLATE,https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/kavanaugh-judge-prep-school-parties.html,"
          Sunday evening, the New Yorker published a second allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But it wasn’t just the new allegation that caught my attention. There’s a paragraph that appears late in the piece in which Elizabeth Rasor, the high school girlfriend of Mark Judge—the man Christine Blasey Ford alleges was in the room when Kavanaugh assaulted her—says that Judge once admitted to what would now be called a potential case of gang rape. This passage does not directly address the new allegation against Kavanaugh, but it does corroborate the kind of culture where something like this could happen:
        
          I wish I were surprised. A week ago Sunday when Ford first shed her anonymity, detailing her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh to the Washington Post, I wrote a note in the Facebook alumni group of my high school, National Cathedral School. I told my 1988 classmates that Ford’s story was bringing back disturbing high school memories. Apparently, I was not alone. A lot of women now in their 40s and 50s, who went to these single-sex D.C. prep schools in the 1980s, have been reaching out to each other in fraught emails and chats over the past week. Not only did the Holton-Arms alumnae start a petition in support of Ford, their fellow alum; there’s also one for anyone to sign who survived that toxic time and place.
        
          I don’t personally know Ford now, and I didn’t know her in high school. But as the Holton women wrote, what Ford is alleging is “all too consistent with what we heard and lived while attending Holton. Many of us are survivors ourselves.” And what Elizabeth Rasor alleges Mark Judge told her is not foreign to me, either. Whether and how the nation comes to hear more about these specific stories, they have evoked a collective scream.
        
          A large part of my high school experience were the parties at cavernous houses with multiple bedrooms, huge dark basements with enormous sofas and yards, and lots and lots of beer. No parents—thinking back on it now, as a parent myself—were ever around. We traveled in groups and knew never to leave a friend alone at a party, but there was so much drinking that we sometimes lost track of each other. It could be difficult to know where your friends were and—if they were in a room with a boy—what was going on in there.
        
          Every June, we had Beach Week—a tradition also described in a Washington Post piece about Ford—in which teenagers actually rent houses to party at the beach, something I still don’t quite comprehend. I distinctly remember being at a Beach Week party with my then-boyfriend when it dawned on us that there was a drunk girl in a room down the hall, and boys were “lining up” to go in there and, presumably, have their way with her. We didn’t know for sure, but my boyfriend and my friend’s boyfriend went to interrupt it and sent her on her way down the stairs. All I remember about her is that she was in the class above us and had dark hair. My friend has told me she remembers boys saying, “I’m next,” which was why our boyfriends went to stop it. That was the only time I can clearly remember a situation that was so obviously a “lineup,” as it was referred to by some at school. My friend remembers witnessing another, and though there weren’t lineups of this nature at every party, they happened often enough that we had a term. We didn’t call it rape.
        
          It was not always so formal a queue. I remember another time when boys were sitting in kind of a campfire circle that could have started as a game of spin the bottle. But by the time I walked through the room there was a girl who was drunk and in the center of the circle, and the boys were taking turns putting their hands up her skirt instead of kissing her.
        
          For these girls who were assaulted, it felt like no one had adequately looked out for them, in a place where groups of two or more boys might be looking for someone who was drunk and vulnerable. I attended these parties knowing there was always a chance of this happening to me, were I not careful. I saw older boys who didn’t participate seem more angry at the girls who had “let” themselves get into bad situations. Our boyfriends had been able to stop that lineup only because they were seniors. But it was often like this: a solitary girl who found herself helpless against the power of a group of boys. It’s why Ford’s description of her alleged attack sounded so plausible to me—two drunk boys who had cornered her and were egging each other on. We went through years of parties like this intimidated, afraid, and horrified. And yet it was also just the way things were.
        
          My high school, NCS, like St. Albans, Holton-Arms, Georgetown Prep, and others, are elite girls and boys schools attended by the sons and daughters of the wealthy and powerful in Washington. Not everyone had famous last names, of course, but they moved in elite social circles in media, law, and politics. The schools were seemingly unofficially partnered, one girls school to one boys. For NCS it was St. Albans. They were the boys just across the way, our other half, built in for us to socialize with. We were allowed to take certain classes with each other in later grades—I distinctly remember St. Albans’ boys telling me that they were going to take the NCS classes “because they were easier.” But we never got to just hang out in the hallways during recess with each other; we didn’t have the opportunity to just be around each other as friends and classmates. I suspect this is part of why every encounter became sexualized.
        
          Now, it’s clear to me how powerless I felt throughout high school. The entire time I attended NCS, we had a male headmaster. We were a school for girls, which was presumably meant to empower us, but the boys were still in charge. High school is where we learned to put up with it. And now, as the prep-school boys are running the country and a kind of masculine backlash has taken hold of our democracy, it feels like we’re back in high school again.
        
          These allegations involving Kavanaugh have clearly touched a nerve across the country and among my cohort. Many of us are processing and grappling with these experiences that linger on our consciences many years later. We need to tell these stories of horror we once hid, in order to overcome those who would hold us back from the world we want to live in. The men who graduated from these schools must take it upon themselves to assess the culture they came of age in, to reflect on and take responsibility for it. The women who experienced these things are angry and rightfully so. And we have all of us been too silent for too long.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-supreme-court-tenure-could-mean-the-end-of-all-campaign-finance-limits.html,"
          By the time President Donald Trump runs for re-election in 2020, he might be able to accept unlimited campaign contributions to support his bid, thanks to his nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. Documents released ahead of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings this week that date from his time in George W. Bush’s White House reveal that the judge just might be ready to strike down what’s left of federal law limiting contributions to candidates, as a First Amendment violation. There are two cases heading to the Supreme Court that would allow him to do just that.
        
          As court watchers are well aware, the Supreme Court has been chipping away at campaign finance limits for some years now. In the 2010 case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court held that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend unlimited sums to support or oppose candidates for office if their payments are made independent of candidates’ campaigns. And in a much less famous but equally important 2014 case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, the same five-justice majority who decided Citizens United made it harder for courts to sustain the constitutionality of laws—aimed at preventing corruption and its appearance—that limit the amount of money that individuals can contribute directly to candidates. As I explained in Slate when Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion, McCutcheon was a “subtly awful decision” that was also vintage Roberts: It subtly undermined old precedents to set the stage for their eventual overruling.
        
          Despite the McCutcheon setup, the court has moved slowly. It so far has passed up an opportunity to review precedents dating back to before Justice Samuel Alito joined the high bench in 2006, when the court flipped from a body deeply deferential to campaign finance regulation to one deeply skeptical of it. The court has repeatedly refused to reconsider the constitutionality of the 2002 McCain-Feingold law limiting the ability of political parties to take “soft money” donations from wealthy individuals, corporations, and labor unions, and has also refused to consider overturning a pre-Alito case, Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont, barring corporations from contributing directly to candidates.
        
          If, as expected, Judge Brett Kavanaugh joins the court, he could well push it to move more quickly in a way that could eventually cause the downfall of the federal law that limits an individual to contributing no more than $2,700 per election to a candidate for federal office. Kavanaugh worked in the Bush White House when it was looking at the McCain-Feingold law, which Bush eventually signed even while expressing constitutional reservations about parts of it in a signing statement.
        
          Recently released documents from the time that Kavanaugh was advising Bush on McCain-Feingold show a person seriously skeptical of campaign finance laws’ constitutionality. Kavanaugh expressed deep misgivings about laws that let outside groups spend unlimited sums in elections while limiting how much candidates and parties can raise to respond to such ads. He told another adviser that he saw “serious” First Amendment problems with capping what people can contribute to candidates, adding that “it is possible my 1A views are even purer than yours.” He also noted that while “very few people” thought contribution limits to candidates are unconstitutional, “I for one tend to think those limits have constitutional problems.”
        
          As Common Cause’s Steve Spaulding notes, “Kavanaugh himself acknowledges in the docs that he’s far outside the mainstream here.” The documents reveal a person who is deeply skeptical of even the most basic campaign finance limits, the ones that say a wealthy person cannot simply write a $100 million check to a candidate to run for office. (Lest you think that amount is fanciful, it is less than the amount that casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the Koch Brothers network have spent in recent elections, and Trump impeachment advocate Tom Steyer has spent nearly that much in the past.) The inequality of influence and corruption and its appearance that could stem from such a system is profound.
        
          And yet this could well be the direction in which we are heading. Right now pending before the court is a cert petition asking the Supreme Court to review Montana’s campaign contribution limits. The issue in the 9th Circuit case of Lair v. Motl may seem a bit esoteric; it concerns how much evidence of corruption a state must produce to support a campaign contribution limit. But make no mistake: The Lair case, brought by Citizens United brainchild Jim Bopp, builds upon Chief Justice Roberts’ McCutcheon decision to argue for a standard that would lead courts to strike down virtually all contribution limits.
        
          The court is also considering petition from opponents of city-level campaign contribution limits in Austin, Texas. Although a 5th Circuit panel upheld Austin’s limits in Zimmerman v. City of Austin, newly confirmed Judge Jim Ho wrote a strong dissent from the entire 5th Circuit’s decision not to rehear the case. Ho, a former clerk of campaign finance law opponent Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a screed arguing that all campaign finance laws violate the First Amendment and people who don’t like big money in politics should simply shrink the size of government so the government doesn’t have a lot of goodies to give away.
        
          Neither Lair nor Zimmerman directly call the federal $2,700 campaign finance limit into question, but either or both cases could be the vehicle to create a precedent that would compel federal courts to strike down the $2,700 limit. It could even happen before the 2020 election. And because this is a constitutional ruling, there would be precious little that Congress could do about it (not that Mitch McConnell, who has helped engineer these events, from supporting the relevant lawsuits to blocking Merrick Garland and shoving Kavanaugh through the Senate without a full document release, would want to do anything but pop open a bottle of Champagne).
        
          As I recently wrote in Slate, the world of election law and voting rights is about to get much worse with Kennedy’s departure. Judge Kavanaugh is already on record as supporting porous campaign finance laws that would allow the Russian government and other foreign entities to spend unlimited sums in our elections. It now appears he believes wealthy Americans have a constitutional right to directly fill candidate coffers with unlimited sums, gaining unprecedented influence over these officials. With Kavanaugh replacing Justice Kennedy, and Chief Justice Roberts in the middle of the court, the era of big money in politics may soon get a heck of a lot worse.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/kavanaugh-smear-job-allegation-is-a-smear-job.html,"
          On Monday, Donald Trump referred to sexual misconduct allegations against new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as “a hoax set up by the Democrats.” While Trump put his own typically hyperbolic spin on the talking point, other Republicans have been saying for some time that Kavanaugh is the victim of a character assassination campaign orchestrated by elected Dems and their wealthy left-wing co-conspirators. Last week, Republican Iowa Senator and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley angrily declared that Democrats “have just about destroyed a good person” and told CNBC that he suspected anti-Kavanaugh protesters were being paid by liberal philanthropist George Soros. Texas Senator and Judiciary Committee member John Cornyn compared Kavanaugh to Tom Robinson, the black victim of a bogus rape accusation (and target of an attempted lynching) in To Kill a Mockingbird. Republican Sen. Susan Collins, explaining her deciding vote in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Friday, called his nomination hearings a “dysfunctional circus” and complained of “dark money” interest groups driving American discourse to a “rock bottom” level.
        
          It’s not just partisan hacks making the argument: Kavanaugh described himself as the victim of a coordinated and “well-funded” smear campaign in his Senate response to Christine Blasey Ford, and his supporters in the ostensibly highbrow, Trump-averse conservative punditsphere have adopted the claim as well. The notion has even crept into the analysis of avowedly reasonable, centrist-respected figures like the New York Times’ David Brooks and Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse. Kavanaugh has become “a pinball in the partisan politics of personal destruction,” Brooks wrote; Sasse, who elsewhere has prominently defended the credibility and honor of sexual assault victims, said that he was “heartbroken” for Kavanaugh and blamed Democrats for turning his confirmation hearings into a “made-for-TV circus.”
        
          With this in mind, let’s review how the most prominent allegations against Kavanaugh were made, limiting ourselves just to individuals who’ve identified themselves publicly.
        
          • Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor in Northern California, contacted the Washington Post and her local congressional representative when she saw that Kavanaugh was being considered for a SCOTUS nomination. She says she remembers Kavanaugh and one of his classmates, Mark Judge, attempting to rape her in 1982 while they were very drunk.
        
          • Deborah Ramirez, a city employee in Boulder, Colorado, came forward to the New Yorker to accuse Kavanaugh of having exposed himself to her while intoxicated when they were both freshmen at Yale. Two other Yale alums—a theological history professor from New Jersey and an ER doctor from California—told the New Yorker they remember hearing about such an incident at the time.
        
          • Several classmates of Kavanaugh’s came forward to dispute his claims, made in a Fox News interview and Senate testimony during which he disputed Ford’s and Ramirez’s allegations, that he never behaved belligerently or inappropriately while drunk and had never been drunk enough to have caused gaps in his memory. One of those people is an oncologist in Washington, one is a history professor in North Carolina, one is the COO of a health care company in Pennsylvania, and another works in software in the Bay Area. The health care executive, Lynne Brookes, says further that she specifically remembers Kavanaugh and a friend drunkenly breaking into a room where a female classmate was involved in a sexual encounter in order to embarrass her.
        
          Police records in New Haven, Connecticut, also cut against Kavanaugh’s claims about his demeanor while drinking, indicating that he was questioned by police after being accused of instigating a bar fight with a man who was then attacked with a beer glass by one of Kavanaugh’s friends.
        
          What we have here, then, is either:
        
          A) A Democratic conspiracy to plant operatives close to Kavanaugh in the 1980s, including one whose job was to, I guess, frame him for a UB40-related bar fight, then disperse those operatives across the country for decades to establish themselves in nonpolitics careers until the time was right to ruin his Supreme Court nomination.
        
          Or:
        
          B) The cumulative result of individual decisions to come forward to reporters, law enforcement authorities, and elected representatives with information relevant to Kavanaugh’s fitness to serve in a high office—often directly in response to claims Kavanaugh made to defend himself from initial allegations.
        
          Respectable conservatives like Sasse and the writers at the Weekly Standard have pinned their case that Kavanaugh has been wronged on Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s failure to bring Ford’s initially confidential letter of allegations to the attention of the Judiciary Committee over the summer, when it might have been investigated privately and without the partisan smear-taint of a Democrat-orchestrated “media circus.” It’s true that we don’t know why Feinstein sat on the letter so long or who then leaked its contents to the press; it’s also true that Ford and Ramirez retained attorneys with connections to Democratic politics and had their allegations amplified by Democratic politicians.
        
          At the same time, these accusers and witnesses had absolutely zero chance of having their testimony taken seriously by the Republicans who, given the way our government works, are the only other people who would have been in a position to do anything. The judiciary staffer leading the committee’s Kavanaugh background investigation responded to Ford’s allegations by tweeting that he was still “determined” to “confirm Judge Kavanaugh.” The judiciary spokesman who initially handled its response to Ford’s allegations worked for the same right-wing PR firm that promoted an insane conspiracy theory that implied one of Kavanaugh’s classmates was the real rapist; that spokesman also turned out to have left a previous job after being accused of sexual harassment. Republican judiciary member Orrin Hatch responded to Ramirez’s allegation by saying it was “phony” on the grounds that “I know it is, that’s why.”
        
          Assuming that a good-faith request for a confidential investigation somehow made it through that group of impartial woman-trusters, it would have been supervised by the White HouseCounsel’s Office, whose initial instructions to the FBI for this week’s abbreviated reinvestigation of Kavanaugh were so narrow that they prompted Republican judiciary member and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to call for a “real investigation” that wasn’t just set up to give Republicans “cover” to vote for the nominee. The White House Counsel’s Office is, of course, also nominally supervised by a president who regularly derides the FBI as an instrument of the Democratic Deep State and who belittled Ford at a rally this week by mockingly and incorrectly claiming that she didn’t remember whether her assault had taken place upstairs or downstairs. The idea that this Judiciary Committee and this White House would ever have responsibly supervised and responded to an impartial, confidential FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh is farcical. That Democratic legislators, Ford’s attorneys, and other allies of hers and Ramirez’s would ultimately choose to circumvent that process and make their case in public is not a sign that they were acting as cynical agents of a leftist smear conspiracy but rather a sign that they possess simple common sense.
        
          There actually was, by contrast, a set of Kavanuagh accusations that was promoted irresponsibly by a Democratic activist who seemed to be nakedly exploiting them to advance his own aspirations: those made by Julie Swetnick, who’s represented by aspiring 2020 candidate Michael Avenatti. But NBC and other outlets have reported skeptically on Swetnick’s story, and Democratic politicians generally treated them with caution relative to the allegations made by Ford and Ramirez. While some Democratic judiciary members discussed Swetnick after she initially released her sworn declaration about Kavanaugh, the party did not subsequently press her claims as a reason to vote Kavanaugh down. In any case, Avenatti’s questionable behavior doesn’t discredit allegations that were made earlier and pursued by individuals who don’t have any connection to him.
        
          The Republican argument that Kavanuagh was smeared has often been accompanied by crocodile tears over the purportedly-just-as-abhorrent way that Democrats have exploited Christine Blasey Ford. Ford did initially ask for confidentiality, and Democrats, like all politicians do regarding every issue, engaged in grandstanding about her claims. One other thing Ford was very consistent about requesting, though, was for Congress to reject Kavanaugh as unfit to serve on the Supreme Court. Perhaps those claiming to have her interests in mind while supporting Kavanaugh’s confirmation—and describing Ford as a “mixed-up,” memory-addled lightweight too confused to realize she’s being used in a “hoax”—should think twice about just who exactly is being smeared.

          The FBI’s supplemental background investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged sexual misconduct is due to drop any minute, and the question is: Who will be able to read all the hot 1982 Georgetown Prep gossip that the feds were (or weren’t) able to secure?
        
          The good news is you will be able to. The bad news is that for now, “you” only applies if “you” are a sitting United States senator.
        
          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared Tuesday that the report would be kept confidential to senators’ eyes only, as is practice, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley concurred on Wednesday.
        
          “I’ve been reading FBI reports for 38 years,” Grassley said. “I don’t know that one’s ever been made public.”
        
          Both he and McConnell are correct that protocol calls for background check results to be kept confidential. But some senators said this week that the extraordinary importance of this background check should merit some sort of redacted release. Obviously, this is what most Democrats are saying—but some Republicans believe it, too.
        
          “Normally it’s not [made public] out of the privacy of the person being investigated, but this is an unusual circumstance,” GOP Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy told reporters Wednesday. “The American people will figure this out for themselves if they have the results of the investigation.”
        
          Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker at least hoped that reporters would be able to take a look at it, a position reporters overwhelmingly support. If not, Corker said on Tuesday, “I’m afraid it’s going to be selectively leaked out, and each side will use the piece that works best for them.”
        
          I asked Kennedy on Tuesday, though, if he would push McConnell to make the report public.
        
          “That’s above my pay grade,” he said. “I will encourage him, but that’s not my call.” It could be Kennedy’s call if he and one other Republican senator refused to support Kavanaugh until the FBI report was made public, but one shouldn’t expect such aggressive tactics from Louisiana’s junior senator.
        
          Instead, per McConnell’s second-in-command, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, Republicans might allow some sort of “public statement” or “summary” of the allegations to come forth. But he doesn’t want that because it will appease Democrats. He wants it because he believes it will publicly clear Kavanaugh’s name.
        
          “I hope that some conclusion, or some summary, will be made public,” Cornyn told reporters Wednesday, “because I hate to see Judge Kavanaugh subjected to these allegations in public … and not see the vindication, if that’s in fact what we see.”
        
          If the FBI report is kept confidential to senators, but some sort of summary is released to the masses, the next procedural dispute—actually, this one’s already started—will be over who writes the summary. Will it be a neutral party, or will it be the majority staff of the Judiciary Committee? And if it’s a neutral party, how is “neutral” properly defined? Is anyone truly neutral?
        
          God help us. It would be a lot more fun if some Democrat just inserted the report into the Congressional Record by reading it on the Senate floor. I asked a few Judiciary Committee Democrats if they would consider it.
        
          “I don’t know,” Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono told me. Until they reach that bridge, she said, she would be pushing for the majority to be as transparent as possible.
        
          “I’m not going to speculate, before we have the report, on what will be done with it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. Another reporter asked if the idea of reading it into the record had come up. Blumenthal paused for several seconds.
        
          “Has the—I’m not going to comment on ideas that may come up,” he said.
        
          I tried to ask New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, but like most Senate Democrats considering a run for president, he is guarded by staffers and walks fast, with long strides, to escape spontaneous interactions with reporters.
        
          California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, does not walk fast. And she seemed uncomfortable with the idea of reading the report into the record.
        
          “Well, I have to find out what the status of it is,” she said. “If it’s confidential, no.”
        
          The logistics of leaking the report, even if a senator is committed to performing this feat of derring-do, would be difficult. Only one physical copy of the supplemental report will be transmitted to the Capitol, and the Judiciary Committee will keep it in a safe. Only 100 senators and a handful of staffers will have access to it. It would be useful for a Democratic senator intent on leaking to secure a pair of contact-lens scanners, of the sort that Tom Cruise might use in the Mission: Impossible series.
        
          Nevertheless, it’s tough to think the report won’t get out somehow. Not to mix up movie metaphors too badly, but when it comes to information that just demands to be released, life finds a way.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/atticus-finch-brett-kavanaugh-john-cornyn-rich-lowry.html,"
          In Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, dramatic action revolves around Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell, in a small Alabama town in the 1930s. Atticus Finch is his court-appointed lawyer, and after he gets the case, his daughter, Scout, the narrator, must contend with the disdain and ostracism of their neighbors.
        
          Atticus, too, stands against the weight of public opinion, even stopping a mob of men eager to dispense vigilante justice. During the trial, Atticus proves the accusers are lying, with Ewell’s father the likely culprit. Despite this, a jury convicts Robinson, who is shot and killed while trying to escape prison.
        
          To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960. Two years later, the character of Atticus Finch was immortalized by actor Gregory Peck in the film directed by Robert Mulligan. That performance, of a righteous man standing against a dangerous, prejudiced mob, has inspired some conservatives as they defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from allegations of sexual assault and misconduct.
        
          National Review editor Rich Lowry uses the example of the fictional Finch to condemn an approach he believes does fatal damage to ideals of fairness and due process. “Atticus Finch didn’t #BelieveAllWomen. He didn’t take an accusation at face value. He defended an alleged rapist, vigorously and unremittingly, making use of every opportunity provided to him by the norms of the Anglo-American system of justice,” wrote Lowry, erroneously stating or deliberately mischaracterizing the view that society shouldn’t dismiss women’s experiences of sexual abuse and violence.
        
          On Thursday, Republican Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn referenced that column in a speech on the Senate floor. “We all remember that Atticus Finch was a lawyer who did not believe that a mere accusation was synonymous with guilt,” he said. “He represented an unpopular person who many people presumed was guilty of a heinous crime because of his race, and his race alone. We could learn from Atticus Finch now, during this time when there has been such a vicious and unrelenting attack on the integrity and good name of this nominee.”
        
          And writing commentary for CBS News, columnist Michael Graham warns liberal Kavanaugh critics that they are “the emotional mob Atticus Finch must face down.”
        
          It’s easy to see the appeal of the Atticus analogy. It casts the Atticus surrogate as a resolute defender of American justice, of its ideals and values. Yes, Atticus Finch is a literary creation, but he stands for something real and enduring. He represents the best of our republican traditions.
        
          By necessarily casting Brett Kavanaugh in the role of the unfairly and unjustly accused Tom Robinson, however, the comparison falls apart. Kavanaugh is unpopular, but he does not belong to a disfavored group. He is not disadvantaged by class or burdened with the weight of caste. He has lived a life of wealth and privilege, moving in and between elite spaces with little apparent friction. For five years he worked with the president of the United States. For 12 years he’s been one of the most powerful judges in the country. Robinson did not have the power to call defenders other than his court-appointed attorney; Kavanaugh is backed by nearly half of the Senate as well as a sitting American president, who has attacked his nominee’s accuser with the full force of the bully pulpit. Atticus Finch risked everything defending Tom Robinson; Kavanaugh’s defenders risk nothing. Robinson, a stand-in for the thousands murdered under Jim Crow, was fighting for his life. If Kavanaugh isn’t confirmed—if enough Republicans decide he’s too damaged to sit on the Supreme Court—he’ll return to his life of power and privilege as a federal appeals court judge.
        
          This alone is an indictment of the analogy. But its failure is deeper than just the incongruence between conservatives and Finch or Kavanaugh and Robinson. During the Jim Crow era, allegations of rape and sexual assault against black men weren’t good-faith efforts to uncover abuse against women. They were pretexts for mob violence and brutal, public executions, meant to punish black Americans for stepping outside the boundaries set by white society. In her influential 1892 report Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases, journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett made this point clear. Cataloging this violence, she concludes that “to palliate this record (which grows worse as the Afro-American becomes intelligent) and excuse some of the most heinous crimes that ever stained the history of a country, the South is shielding itself behind the plausible screen of defending the honor of its women.”
        
          The accusers in To Kill a Mockingbird, like those in the actual Jim Crow South, weren’t concerned with sexual violence as much as they held a libidinal desire to harm and kill black people. In real-life Depression-era Alabama, nine black Americans were lynched between 1929 and 1939; two of the victims were accused of “rape.”
        
          That charade of justice stands in stark contrast to the #MeToo movement, a sincere effort to uncover sexual abuse, build solidarity for survivors, and hold abusers accountable. The process of allegations, investigations, and—when appropriate—criminal action is on the opposite side of the lynch mob, which tortured, mutilated, and murdered on the basis of whispers and rumors. The testimony of Christine Blasey Ford—measured, meticulous, and forthright, with no proven falsehoods—is a far cry from the breathless accusations used to justify anti-black terrorism, as is her unheeded call for a full investigation of her allegations.
        
          To make the analogy to Atticus Finch in the context of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is to ignore the real pain and real suffering of actual people killed after knowingly false accusations, while obliterating vast worlds of history and context. It’s not just a bad argument. It’s an immoral one, made for cheap partisan thrills. And conservatives who make it have revealed their politics of aggrieved privilege, where the presumably “real” victims of society are those asked to account for any potential misdeeds before ascending to ever-higher planes of power.
        
          If you want to make the Atticus Finch analogy, you must understand the actual dynamic of the story in question. You can claim the mantle of Lee’s hero if you are standing in defense of the marginalized, giving voice to claims of innocence, or victimhood, that are otherwise ignored, dismissed, or ridiculed. You can claim Atticus if you fight for the powerless, for those who might truly lose everything from speaking out, who feel the weight of society against them.
        
          Looking at our society and the ubiquity of sexual violence—looking at the extent to which women are presumptively challenged and men presumptively exonerated—there are opportunities to deploy the Atticus Finch analogy for those who want to use it. It’s not in defense of Brett Kavanaugh.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/kavanaugh-ramirez-new-yorker-response-friends-perjury-texts-fbi.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh and his team were in contact with former classmates and friends in an attempt to refute, before publication in the New Yorker last month, Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez’s allegation that he exposed himself to her at a college party and “thrust his penis in her face,” NBC News reports. A series of text messages between Kerry Berchem, who was at Yale with both Kavanaugh and Ramirez, and another friend of Kavanaugh’s, Karen Yarasavage, indicate that Kavanaugh was aware of Ramirez’s accusation before it was published. Berchem, NBC News reports, has contacted the FBI twice to try to hand over memos containing information about the interactions, but has so far not been contacted by investigators.
        
          From NBC News:
        
          The NBC News report is relevant for several reasons. One, Kavanaugh said, under oath during his testimony last week, that the first time he had heard of Ramirez’s allegations was in the New Yorker story. The text messages would indicate that that is not true and would get to the larger point that Kavanaugh has not told the truth in a number of instances during the confirmation process, and potentially perjured himself. Second, the report raises the question of whether the breadth of the FBI investigation under a tight time frame is sufficient and whether investigators will, in fact, track down all relevant leads. Finally, the fact that Kavanaugh was personally interacting and coordinating with people who might later be called as witnesses could be legally perilous. Bob Bauer, former White House counsel for President Obama, told NBC News that a nominee directly contacting people with information would be “surprising” and “highly imprudent.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-accusation-fbi-senate-committee-investigation.html,"
          Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who claims that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers more than 30 years ago, wants an investigation. In a letter sent Tuesday to Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers called for an FBI probe of “the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter.”
        
          Grassley and his allies aren’t interested. They oppose an FBI investigation and are trying to limit the committee’s inquiry on the grounds that nothing can be learned. “The claims are wholly unverifiable,” says Sen. Orrin Hatch, the committee’s senior Republican. Grassley says he’s willing to hear testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh but nobody else. The Wall Street Journal editorial page says there’s no point in even holding a hearing, since “there is no way to confirm her story.”
        
          These attempts to truncate or dismiss the inquiry are wrong. There’s a lot that can and should be investigated to resolve what happened. Here’s a list.
        
          1. Witnesses. “There are no other witnesses to call,” says the Journal. That’s false. In her July 30 letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Ford wrote that at least five people, including her, attended the gathering at which the assault allegedly occurred. One is Mark Judge, a friend and classmate of Kavanaugh’s who, according to Ford, was in the room with her and Kavanaugh during the assault. In an interview with the Washington Post, Ford also named two other teens who, by her account, attended the party. The Post reported that it tried to contact those two people on Sunday, but they “did not respond to messages.”
        
          The committee needs to interview these two people for two reasons. The first reason is to ask them whether Ford, Kavanaugh, and Judge disappeared together, as her story implies. But even if the two alleged witnesses don’t remember that, there’s a second reason: Hatch’s communications director says that in a conversation on Monday, Kavanaugh told Hatch that he “was not at any party like the one she describes.” Furthermore, the Post reports that Kavanaugh, “through a White House spokesman … did not respond to questions about whether he knew her [Ford] during high school.” If either of the putative witnesses recalls Kavanaugh being at a small party with Ford, that raises questions about Kavanaugh’s memory or veracity.
        
          2. Denials. Another Republican on the committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, says there’s “no reason” for Judge to testify, since “He’s already said what he’s gonna say.” The Journal agrees, asserting that Judge, like Kavanaugh, “says he recalls no such event.” But there’s a curious gap between Judge’s statements and Kavanaugh’s.
        
          Kavanaugh’s denials are firm. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” he replied when Ford’s letter, apparently with her name omitted, was initially described to him. “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.” On Monday, after the Post reported Ford’s name and further details of her story, Kavanaugh reiterated: “This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone.”
        
          Judge is less adamant. “I have no recollection of that,” he told the New Yorker when the allegation was first broadly outlined to him. Later, he told the New York Times, “I never saw anything like what was described.” But in interviews with the Times and the Weekly Standard, Judge signaled that his denials were based on a general portrait of Kavanaugh’s character. Kavanaugh wasn’t “into anything crazy or illegal,” and both boys were raised in good Catholic homes, he argued, so an incident like the one Ford described “would stick out.” And that, he concluded, “is why I don’t think it would happen.”
        
          Judge’s entry in his senior yearbook provides grounds to doubt his denials. It includes this quote from playwright Noël Coward: “Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.” So it’s worth pressing Judge about the extent of his uncertainty. And it’s worth asking Kavanaugh why he’s more confident than Judge.
        
          3. Kavanaugh’s alcohol use. The most likely reason for Judge’s uncertainty is that Judge is a confessed recovering alcoholic. He knows that in their high school days, he sometimes got drunk to the point of not remembering what he had done. Therefore, he understands that even if he can’t believe he or Kavanaugh would have done what Ford alleges, it’s possible that it happened. In a statement issued on Tuesday by his attorney, Judge says: “I have no memory of this incident.”
        
          In her letter and in her interview with the Post, Ford says Kavanaugh and Judge were “highly inebriated,” “very drunken,” and “stumbling drunk.” Specifically, she recalls that Kavanaugh’s impairment thwarted his attempts to pull her clothes off. That part of her account raises two questions that can be investigated. First, did Judge and Kavanaugh have a history of drinking? Second, did their drinking sometimes lead to them do things that they later didn’t remember?
        
          In Judge’s case, the answer to both questions is yes. He has written two books about his alcoholism and his high school years. He admits that he drank at teen parties, got “completely annihilated,” and sometimes woke up with no idea how he ended up where he was. He also depicts a character named “Bart O’Kavanaugh” who “puked in someone’s car” and “passed out on his way back from a party.”
        
          How closely does that character match Kavanaugh? We don’t know. But we know from Kavanaugh’s yearbook entry that he drank. He claimed to belong to the “Keg City Club” (“100 kegs or bust”) and the “Beach Week Ralph Club.” Photos showed him and Judge at the beach together. During “beach week,” Judge recalls in one of his books, “Most of the time everyone, including the girls, was drunk. If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up.”
        
          After they graduated, Kavanaugh went to Yale, where, according to the Yale Daily News and the Hartford Courant, he joined a “party-hearty” fraternity that “reviv[ed] a beer-drinking competition that college officials had banned from campus.” Kavanaugh also drank at Yale Law School. In a speech four years ago, he recalled organizing “a night of Boston bar-hopping,” with students “doing group chugs from a keg” and “falling out of the bus.” “We had a motto, what happens on the bus stays on the bus,” said Kavanaugh. He went on to describe a banquet at which a friend broke a table:
        
          Kavanaugh’s story about piecing together in retrospect that he had been drinking before the banquet resembles Ford’s story about her assault. According to the Post, she recalled “that each person had one beer but that Kavanaugh and Judge had started drinking earlier and were heavily intoxicated.” Kavanaugh’s account also highlights the difficulty of recalling how you got drunk and what you did. So the committee needs to look at two questions. One is whether Kavanaugh’s history with alcohol casts doubt on his assurances that he couldn’t have done what Ford alleges. The second question is whether his refusal to entertain such doubts reveals a lack of humility, candor, or openness to evidence.
        
          4. Ford’s memory. Unlike Anita Hill and the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual offenses, Ford says she has no contemporaneous record of her account. She told nobody. That leaves open the possibility that she fabricated the story years later. More plausibly, her delay in recording or reporting her account increases the risk that her memory, like all memories, has eroded or changed. She’s unsure exactly when and where the incident happened. If you don’t think Kavanaugh could have done what she alleges, it’s reasonable to ask whether she might be misremembering exactly what happened, or even who did it. But in that case, you should want testimony from the witnesses she has named.
        
          We also need more detail about Ford’s first account of the assault. According to the Post, Ford’s husband says that “early in their relationship, she told him she had been a victim of physical abuse.” That conversation would have been around 2002, before Kavanaugh was a judge. After that, there’s no record of Ford telling anyone until 2012, when Ford talked about it with her therapist. During the 2012 conversation, Ford explicitly “voiced concern that Kavanaugh—then a federal judge—might one day be nominated to the Supreme Court,” according to her husband, as paraphrased by the Post. That timing, coupled with the reference to Kavanaugh joining the court, makes some Republicans wonder whether Kavanaugh’s ascent caused Ford to exaggerate or even concoct her account. But if she told the basic story a decade earlier, when he wasn’t even a judge, that motive wouldn’t apply.
        
          Maybe Ford is mistaken about who was in the room and what happened. Maybe her memory is accurate, and Kavanaugh and Judge were too drunk to remember. Or maybe somebody is lying. We don’t have enough evidence yet to settle those questions. But we have enough evidence to know one thing: The committee has a lot of leads to work with. It should get on with the job.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-the-judges-disastrous-record-on-campaign-finance.html,"
          As Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings have gotten underway this week, one critical area of his jurisprudence has been underexplored: Judge Kavanaugh’s views on campaign finance law. After all, he could rule on President Donald Trump’s own legal exposure for possible criminal violations of campaign finance laws. More fundamentally, Judge Kavanaugh has played a leading role in undermining legal limits on big money in elections. He has done so by misinterpreting a major Supreme Court precedent. This record reinforces widespread concern that he will tilt the court against “settled law” in Roe v. Wade and other cases.
        
          The most important manifestation of Judge Kavanaugh’s campaign finance perspective is his opinion in the 2009 D.C. Circuit Court case Emily’s List v. Federal Election Commission. There, Judge Kavanaugh declared unconstitutional decades-old limits on large contributions to nonprofit groups spending in federal elections. The 2–1 decision was sternly criticized at the time by fellow conservative George W. Bush appointee, Judge Janice Rogers Brown. Notably, her dissent expressed “grave doubts about the court’s analysis” of Supreme Court precedents.
        
          Making his rounds in the Senate, Kavanaugh has emphasized his appropriate respect for judicial precedent. Yet, as Judge Brown observed, the Emily’s List opinion was in “perhaps irreconcilable tension” with the then-reigning precedent of the Supreme Court.
        
          Emily’s List is a top federal PAC. It challenged revised FEC regulations that had limited its use of donations exceeding federal limits for election activities that simultaneously benefited state and federal candidates. Kavanaugh determined the regulations went beyond federal law. But the main thrust of his opinion was much broader. Under the Constitution, he argued, the federal government could not put any limits on contributions to PACs and nonprofits that spent independently of candidates—even for purely federal elections. That would violate the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech.
        
          Kavanaugh acknowledged that the Supreme Court had recognized the government’s legitimate anti-corruption interest in regulating campaign money. However, he maintained that the court’s precedents defined corruption narrowly as candidates and donors exchanging “dollars for political favors”—or appearing to do so. Under that standard, he deduced, it was “implausible” that contributions to nonprofit entities, which did not contribute directly to candidates but supported them only through independent spending, would be corrupting. In reality, it should have been very plausible since the donors would remain free to communicate their support to benefiting candidates. After limits were eventually struck down, 80 percent of the top 100 individual donors to independent spenders in the 2012 and 2014 elections also gave directly to the same candidates they supported through their contributions to independent groups.
        
          Judge Brown agreed with Kavanaugh that the regulations were illegal and moreover constituted a “weighty burden on speech.” “But,” she cautioned, “there is a rub. We sit on a lower court and ‘must follow the binding Supreme Court precedent’ until the Court overrules it. … Stare decisis means nothing if we are only bound by cases with which we already agree.” This was a direct rebuke—Brown proceeded to highlight Kavanaugh’s disregard for key portions of the most recent and relevant Supreme Court precedent on corruption, the 2003 case McConnell v. FEC. She showed that the McConnell court had in fact employed an “expansive” definition of corruption, one “not limited … to the elimination of cash-for-vote exchanges” between donors and candidates but extending to “the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.” Moreover, the court had upheld Congress’ right to enact “broad prophylaxes” to prevent candidates and parties from circumventing their contribution limits. McConnell, she concluded, was therefore “broad enough to encompass some limits on independent expenditure committees.”
        
          Kavanaugh contended that McConnell focused on restricting large contributions to political parties, not independent spending groups. Brown countered, “Nothing in [McConnell’s] logic clearly precludes” Congress or the Federal Election Commission from similarly regulating independent spending groups, particularly those with “a self-proclaimed electoral mission.”
        
          Just six months later, though, the full circuit took up the very same constitutional issue in SpeechNow.org v. FEC. It abandoned Kavanaugh’s reading of the old precedents and tacitly approved Brown’s. Nevertheless, it held that a newly minted decision of the Supreme Court, Citizens United, had “retracted” McConnell’s and other cases’ “expanded” definitions of corruption. The new definition—quid pro quo deals between candidates and donors—was the same narrow one that Kavanaugh had wrongfully drawn from prior precedents in Emily’s List. The circuit then cited this new standard to reaffirm Judge Kavanaugh’s dubious opinion that unlimited contributions to independent spenders do not corrupt candidates.
        
          After SpeechNow.org, super PACs and other nonprofit independent spenders poured $1.43 billion into the 2016 federal elections—22 percent of total spending. Moreover, their funds were concentrated on the most competitive races. These groups were overwhelmingly financed by the wealthy few. In the 2016 election cycle, the top 1 percent of individual donors (516 people) provided 76 percent of reported contributions; the top 100 givers alone supplied 61 percent. Notwithstanding current political rhetoric, there is no greater threat to U.S. democratic elections than this emerging plutocracy. Judge Kavanaugh showed his willingness to misinterpret precedents as a lower-court judge in order to undo laws that were keeping that threat at bay. There’s every chance that he will go even further once his job includes the power to reverse precedents.
        
          For his zeal to overturn legal limits on contributions to independent spending groups, his magical precocity in anticipating the Supreme Court’s new, “crabbed” definition of corruption, and his success in selling some improbable reasoning to his colleagues, Kavanaugh might be considered the godfather of super PACs. For his flawed interpretations of Supreme Court campaign finance precedents—and what these portend for his attitude toward “settled law” —he merits wider Senate inquiry into his judicial record.

          A woman represented by Democratic activist and attorney Michael Avenatti saw Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh repeatedly engage in inappropriate, nonconsensual sexual conduct when she knew him during high school, she says in a sworn declaration released Wednesday morning.*
        
          The woman, a Maryland native named Julie Swetnick, says in a sworn declaration that she met Kavanaugh and his Georgetown Prep classmate Mark Judge at a D.C.-area party in 1980 or 1981. (Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her, says Judge was present during the assault, which she believes took place in 1982.) Swetnick thereafter became friendly with the pair, she says, and attended a number of subsequent house parties with them.* At those parties, she says, she witnessed Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,” behavior that included “attempting to remove or shift girls’ clothing to expose private body parts.” (Ford had previously accused Kavanaugh of holding her down and attempting to remove her clothes.)
        
          Even more seriously, she says that Kavanaugh and Judge participated in efforts to “cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.” She says that she has a “firm recollection” of individuals including Kavanaugh and Judge “lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ‘turn’ with a girl inside the room”—and that in “approximately 1982” she was “the victim of one of these ‘train’ or ‘gang rapes’ where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.” (She says she believes she was drugged before it took place.)
        
          Kavanaugh denies the allegations and says he does not know who Swetnick is.
        
          While Swetnick does not say specifically that Judge and Kavanaugh raped her, only that they were “present,” her declaration severely contradicts Kavanaugh’s claim, made in a Monday Fox News interview, that he had never “saw or heard of” any incident in which multiple male students took advantage of a female student sexually when he was in high school. Judge, who has said that he has “no recollection” of the incident that Christine Blasey Ford alleges took place, published a book in 1997 called Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk that includes a character named “Bart O’Kavanaugh” who becomes drunk and vomits. On Wednesday, Kavanaugh released a calendar he kept in 1982 that includes an apparent reference to drinking with Judge (” ’skis w/Judge”). Republicans have said they do not plan to call Judge as a witness in Kavanaugh’s ongoing confirmation process, which is expected to continue Thursday with Ford’s testimony. (Judge’s attorney has denied Swetnick’s allegation.)
        
          Swetnick, per her declaration, has training in computer systems engineering and has worked for federal agencies including the IRS, the U.S. Mint, and the Department of Defense.
        
          On Sunday, the New Yorker published a report in which a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s named Deborah Ramirez said that she remembers Kavanaugh exposing his penis to her during a party. (That story also included an allegation by one of Judge’s ex-girlfriends that he once told her “ashamedly” about an incident in which he and a number of other boys had sex with a drunk woman, though he allegedly said he believed it to be consensual.) The Republican-led Judiciary Committee does not have any apparent plans to call either Ramirez or Swetnick to testify.

          Brett Kavanaugh wants you to know that all he’s asking for is a “fair process.” During his interview with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum on Monday night, the Supreme Court nominee used that phrase 17 times, often to avoid answering MacCallum’s (pretty good) questions. It’s one of a handful of stock answers that Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, tossed at MacCallum during a conversation that was so on script that it might as well have been published as talking points.
        
          Given that Kavanaugh barely ventured beyond what he’s already said in statements to the press, Monday’s interview clearly wasn’t designed to let him tell his side of the story. Instead, it was an opportunity for the nominee to convey their decency, to prove to the world that he’s too nice a guy to have sexually assaulted anyone. This was likely a preview of what the country will see on Thursday, when both Kavanaugh and his first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          The most alarming thing about Monday’s interview, aside from Kavanaugh’s robotic repetition, was how wildly it diverged in tone and substance from a letter he sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier on Monday. It marked his most vigorous effort thus far to contest the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who allege that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted them. Ford claims Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge attempted to rape her at a house party in the summer of 1982, when the nominee was 17. Ramirez claims Kavanaugh thrust his penis in her face during a drunken dormitory party, making her touch it without her consent. Ford has agreed to testify at Thursday’s hearing, and pivotal Republican Sen. Susan Collins has said she wants Senate investigators to question Ramirez under oath as well.
        
          Kavanaugh initially denied both charges in a measured and concise statement. But in his Monday letter, the nominee went full Clarence Thomas, painting himself as the victim of a “coordinated” attack. He dismissed Ramirez’s “false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago” as part of a “frenzy to come up with something—anything—that will block this process.” The claims from Ramirez and Ford, he insisted, “are smears, pure and simple.” And he declared that this “grotesque and obvious … last-minute character assassination” will “dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.”
        
          On Fox News on Monday night, Kavanaugh didn’t dismiss Ramirez and Ford or say they were part of a smear campaign. Rather, he said he only wished to “defend my integrity and clear my name.”
        
          “I’ve always treated women with dignity and respect,” Kavanaugh insisted. “Listen to the people who’ve known me best my whole life.” Did he commit sexual assault? He “never saw any such thing.” Did he engage in lurid sexual encounters? He “never participated in any such thing.” Rather, he was focused on “trying to be No. 1 in my class” and “captain of the varsity basketball team” while working on “service projects” and “going to church.” Also, he did not have “anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.”
        
          This image of a nearly irreproachable Kavanaugh clashes with Judge’s account of their youthful foibles; in his book Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, Judge described a “Bart O’Kavanaugh” vomiting in cars and passing out during benders. Clearly aware of this contradiction, Kavanaugh admitted that, “Yes, there were parties” and that “people might’ve had too many beers on occasion.” But in the interview on Fox News, he denied drinking to the point of blacking out and said, with respect to the allegations of sexual assault, “I’ve never, never done anything like this.”
        
          In his hearings and in Monday’s interview, there was a consistent pattern in what Kavanaugh remembered and what he forgot. He doesn’t remember seeing Alex Kozinski, his friend and mentor for more than a quarter-century, engage in sexual harassment—even though multiple victims have alleged that Kozinski’s inappropriate behavior was frequent and relentless.He does know that he himself never committed sexual abuse, and that any claims to the contrary are “smears, pure and simple.” Kavanaugh doesn’t remember receiving sexually explicit emails that Kozinski blasted out to his associates on a regular basis, and apparently can’t be bothered to search his records for them. He apparently was able to produce a calendar from 1982 that ostensibly helped exonerate him of Ford’s allegations.
        
          While this discrepancy doesn’t prove anything about Kavanaugh’s conduct, it does reveal a fair amount about his approach to his current problem. It’s clear that when Kavanaugh feels that he needs to remember something, he remembers it. And when he doesn’t remember an alleged incident, that means it could not have occurred. There were no surprises in Monday’s interview and there probably won’t be any in his testimony on Thursday. He has committed to a narrative of absolute innocence, one in which Ford and Ramirez are the real villains and he is a virtuous victim.

          There can be no dispute that Brett Kavanaugh’s answers to Senate Judiciary Committee questions have been well rehearsed. As many committee members have observed, his answers to the senators’ subject area–specific questions are so intentionally generic that they can be repeated, in toto, at least three area codes away.
        
          But while it’s easy to become hyperfocused on the case names Judge Kavanaugh pulls out time and time again—Hamdan, Youngstown, Morrison, Nixon, etc.—there is a good deal we can learn from the case names Kavanaugh fails to cite, even when they are building blocks of the doctrine he is describing. Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh’s unnamed cases have proved to be almost as revealing as the decisions he continues to invoke. In at least two crucial areas—abortion and marriage equality—it’s clear that his refusal to acknowledge important precedent tells us almost as much as the cases he can discuss.
        
          In the abortion context, Kavanaugh has insisted that he understands the “real-world” concerns of the groups that worry about Kavanaugh’s record as well as Donald Trump’s promise to seat a justice who would end abortion rights. Senators have questioned him at length about some of his tells, including his use of the phrase abortion on demand; in a colloquy Thursday with Ted Cruz, the nominee also referred to contraception as “abortion-inducing drugs.” We also learned Thursday that in a memo Kavanaugh wrote in 2003, he acknowledged that the Supreme Court “can always overrule” Roe v. Wade, despite his claims that it represents settled law. “I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level,” he wrote, “since Court can always overrule its precedent,” adding that some conservative justices then on the court “would do so.”
        
          Nevertheless, Kavanaugh has sought to reassure senators that he isn’t apt to mess with Roe: “As a general proposition, I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,” Kavanaugh told Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday. “It has been reaffirmed many times over the past 45 years.” He elaborated, repeatedly referencing 1992’s Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, a case that he routinely cites when he talks about Roe as “settled law.” As he explained it to Feinstein on Wednesday, “Casey specifically reconsidered [Roe], applied the stare decisis factors, and decided to reaffirm it. That makes Casey a precedent on precedent.”
        
          Oddly, though, Kavanaugh’s time clock pretty consistently stops at Casey, and he does not ever seem to mention the landmark 2016 decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which not only reaffirmed the core holdings of Roe and Casey but also significantly bolstered the definition of an “undue burden”—the kinds of speed bumps government may place in the way of a woman seeking to terminate her pregnancy.
        
          In Whole Woman’s Health, Justice Breyer, writing for a five-justice majority, struck down several Texas abortion restrictions on clinics in the state, explaining that the undue-burden standard demands that courts consider “the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits.” A law whose burdens outweigh its benefits cannot pass constitutional muster. Post–Whole Woman’s Health, it became clear that courts must assess whether an abortion restriction furthers any valid government purpose, rather than merely defer to a state’s vague claims that any justification sought for such a restriction is reasonable. For the first time, and in important ways, the mushy “undue burden” test laid out in Casey had real teeth.
        
          As University of California–Irvine law professor Leah Litman has explained, courts that have sought to erode that test in the years since Whole Woman’s Health have used all sorts of tricks and devices to pretend that the undue-burden test was some vaporous thing into which all the hopes and dreams of abortion opponents could be packed. In some instances, they have managed to distinguish or mischaracterize it. But in his notorious dissenting opinion in Garza v. Hargan, Kavanaugh simply ignored it. In a move that looks familiar after this week, he cited Roe and Casey and a slew of cases about parental consent. But the directive in Whole Woman’s Health—that reviewing judges take seriously the burdens placed before women and reckon with the asserted interests proffered by the government—went wholly ignored. Why, one might ask, does this case not enter into the pantheon of Roe and Casey, becoming, for all intents and purposes, precedent on precedent on precedent? Perhaps because it doesn’t strike Kavanaugh as “settled law.” Or perhaps because reverse engineering Casey has become the road map to effectively ending legal abortion in the United States.
        
          Kavanaugh pulled a similar trick on Thursday in a colloquy regarding unenumerated rights with Republican Sen. John Kennedy. The Fifth and 14th Amendments bar the government from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property without due process of law,” and the Supreme Court has long held that this constitutional liberty encompasses certain fundamental rights. In Casey, for instance, the court affirmed that a women’s ability to terminate her pregnancy pre-viability is “implicit in the meaning of liberty” under the Constitution.
        
          When Kennedy asked Kavanaugh how the court determines which rights are protected under the Due Process Clause, the nominee cited not Casey but 1997’s Washington v. Glucksberg. In that decision, the Supreme Court had ruled that physician-assisted suicide is not a constitutional guarantee. The court declared that only those unenumerated “rights and liberties” that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” receive protection. And because states have, for centuries, prohibited doctors from hastening a patient’s death, they may continue to do so today.
        
          Glucksberg purported to announce a restrictive, backward-looking test for fundamental rights analysis. Yet just a few years later, in 2003’s Lawrence v. Texas, the court struck down “sodomy” bans under the Due Process Clause—and failed to cite Glucksberg even once. Instead, the court deployed a more progressive analysis, declaring that “times can blind us to certain truths,” and that “persons in every generation can invoke [the Constitution’s] principles in their own search for greater freedom.” As Justice Antonin Scalia noted accurately in his dissent, Lawrence significantly eroded Glucksberg’s cramped conception of liberty.
        
          Twelve years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the court struck down same-sex marriage bans—and expressly limited Glucksberg to its facts, effectively neutering its stingy due-process test. While Glucksberg’s history-based approach “may have been appropriate” for “physician-assisted suicide,” the court wrote, “it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy.” It continued:
        
          Writing in Slate at the time, NYU School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino described these passages as “a wholesale attack on Glucksberg’s formulation.” The notion that only those liberties “deeply rooted in history and tradition” are protected by the Constitution, Yoshino concluded, was quickly becoming a “bare remnant of abandoned doctrine.”
        
          And yet, on Thursday, that doctrine is precisely what Kavanaugh cited as the test to determine which enumerated rights receive constitutional safeguards. (He also praised it in a 2017 speech and told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday that “all roads lead to Glucksberg.”) The court’s approach to these fundamental rights, he declared, “is reflected now in the Glucksberg test.”
        
          No, it isn’t. It’s reflected in Obergefell, which is resolutely forward-looking, compelling judges to consider the “new insights” of “future generations” to protect “the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.” Yet Kavanaugh declined to mention this ruling, except when he refused to tell Democratic Sens. Kamala Harris and Chris Coons whether he thought it was correctly decided. When Coons called out Kavanaugh for elevating Glucksberg above Obergefell, the nominee responded that Elena Kagan had also cited Glucksberg favorably during her confirmation hearing. That’s a non sequitur, since, at that time, the court had not decided Obergefell and, in the process, disavowed Glucksberg. 
        
          It’s already painfully clear that Kavanaugh manipulates precedent to expand the reach of decisions he likes (like pro-gun rulings) while smothering decisions he opposes (like Casey). Indeed it’s well-known that he has cited dissents when they serve his purposes. But the nominee’s refusal—throughout his hearings—to acknowledge the impact of Whole Woman’s Health and Obergefell on his analysis of the law takes this cherry-picking to a new level. It’s one thing to be poised to take us back to a time before these seminal cases were even decided. It’s affirmatively shocking to pretend that they are already wiped off the books.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-could-backfire-on-republicans.html,"
          Senate Republicans are in a double bind when it comes to defending Brett Kavanaugh. Backed by President Trump and conservative activists, they’ve dug in, signaling their plan to go forward with a confirmation vote if Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party they attended as teenagers, chooses not to testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. Ford wants the FBI to investigate the incident, which might not confirm her exact account but could fatally threaten Kavanaugh’s denials.
        
          Their commitment is rational. Republicans are achingly close to cementing a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the next generation, which will almost certainly deliver an effective end to Roe v. Wade and other legal bugaboos of the conservative movement.
        
          But there are also short-term stakes. Presidents and parties can lose battles for the Supreme Court and still recover, but the pain will linger. A Kavanaugh collapse would worsen an already-perilous midterm environment for the GOP, demoralizing Republican voters just weeks before voting. But a Kavanaugh confirmation could prove dangerous as well. In a political moment shaped by women’s anger, from the Women’s March to the #MeToo movement, putting Kavanaugh on the court despite a credible allegation of sexual assault could prove disastrous for Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress.
        
          Brett Kavanaugh wasn’t the only name on Trump’s short list for the Supreme Court. The president had options. There was Amy Coney Barrett, a former law professor confirmed to the 7th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals last year with bipartisan support—and likely firm vote against Roe. There was Thomas Hardiman, a runner-up for the seat held by Neil Gorsuch and judge on the 3rd U.S Circuit Court of Appeals. There was Joan Larsen, a 6th Circuit judge and former clerk for Antonin Scalia with sterling conservative credentials. And there was Amul Thapar, also on the 6th Circuit, with strong backing from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.*
        
          Options for Trump are also options for Senate Republicans, who could reject Kavanaugh and still confirm a replacement before the end of the year. But the political risks of rejecting the president’s favored nominee now are too high. Conservative evangelicals backed Trump in hopes of winning an anti-abortion majority on the Supreme Court. They are his most reliable constituency, one reason his job approval hasn’t collapsed entirely, and key factor if Republicans plan to survive a “blue wave” in the fall. They want Kavanaugh, and if Republicans fail to put him on the court, their support may waver.
        
          “One of the political costs of failing to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is likely the loss of the United States Senate,” said evangelical leader Ralph Reed to the New York Times. Reed and his peers have urged the White House to push forward and ignore the allegations against Kavanaugh, under threat of political disaster. “If Republicans were to fail to defend and confirm such an obviously and eminently qualified and decent nominee,” Reed said, “then it will be very difficult to motivate and energize faith-based and conservative voters in November.”
        
          Confirming Kavanaugh might preserve Republican turnout, but it could also energize Democrats.
        
          Even before Ford levied her accusation of sexual assault, Brett Kavanaugh was one of the most unpopular Supreme Court nominees in recent memory. In July, according to Fox News, 38 percent of Americans said they would vote to confirm him for the court, versus 32 percent who said “No” and 30 percent who were unsure. In August, after a month of debate, 45 percent of Americans said they would vote to confirm versus 46 percent who said they wouldn’t—just 9 percent were unsure. His numbers were similarly low at the start of September: 38 percent support, 39 percent opposed, and 23 percent undecided, according to CNN.
        
          Much of this reflects attitudes toward President Trump, whose popularity sank in the last weeks of summer, dropping from a rough average of 42 percent job approval to a rough average of 40 percent approval, a significant decline in an era of high partisanship and rigid polarization. Still, Kavanaugh’s numbers make him the least popular Supreme Court nominee since Robert Bork, rejected in 1987 by a bipartisan group of senators for his right-wing views on civil rights as well as his role in the Watergate “Saturday Night Massacre.”
        
          Ford’s accusations have worsened Kavanaugh’s standing. Reuters/Ipsos shows a 6 point increase in opposition since its last poll in August. A Gallup poll also shows rising skepticism of Kavanaugh’s nomination. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey has Kavanaugh “below water” with voters—a first in that poll’s history.
        
          To confirm Kavanaugh in the face of deep unpopularity and serious controversy is to make a Democratic House—and a Democratic Senate—more likely. Like the tax cuts—which were similarly unpopular—Justice Kavanaugh might be a partisan accomplishment so toxic that it backfires on Republican politicians, especially with college-educated suburban women, who are already leaving the GOP in droves. The only other option is to drop Kavanaugh for another nominee—and risk a deadly blow to conservative enthusiasm in November.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-donald-trump.html,"
          During Thursday’s final round of questioning of Judge Brett Kavanaugh at his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked the nominee what seemed like a simple question.
        
          “Judge, you’ve spoken about the president’s unlimited prosecutorial discretion,” Harris noted. “Does that discretion allow him to target his political enemies for prosecution and spare his friends?”
        
          Kavanaugh began droning on about how the limits of prosecutorial discretion require further study before Harris cut him off, repeating a version of the simple yes-no question. “Do you agree with the principle that a sitting president should not politicize the Justice Department?” she asked. Kavanaugh said he couldn’t answer. “That is asking me to weigh in on the political arena,” he offered.
        
          And so, this week, the question of whether or not a president can use the Department of Justice to punish political enemies and offer his friends impunity to commit crimes became a debatable, two-sided political question. Kavanaugh’s refusal to comment on the question of whether the president can turn the DOJ into his own personal Stasi was part of a pattern of refusals to answer once-simple questions that are now, in Trump’s America, considered “political controversies.”
        
          By saying nothing, Kavanaugh revealed the extent to which he will be Trump’s Supreme Court justice. He also showed that Trumpism has become the ethos of the Republican Party. As GOP senators, constitutional scholars, and even the American Bar Association argued during the hearings, Kavanaugh is considered to be a mainstream conservative judge. If a supposedly independent jurist like Kavanaugh sees Trump’s authoritarian decrees as debatable political points rather than clear constitutional violations, then there’s no mistaking that we’ve moved into a new era in American jurisprudence.
        
          Harris’ question was just one of many questions that Kavanaugh felt unable to discuss. Here’s a list of instances in which the Supreme Court nominee refused to draw a line in the sand, or to get within three ZIP codes of the sand, or to express any opinion whatsoever about lines or sand:
        
          • Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked Kavanaugh how he felt about Trump’s declaration that it was within his authority to order torture worse than waterboarding. “I’m not going to comment on—and don’t think I can, sitting here—on current events,” Kavanaugh responded.
        
          • When Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham asked him about special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigative authority, Kavanaugh responded, “I don’t want to talk specifically about current events.”
        
          • Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse asked Kavanaugh about his previous statements that President Bill Clinton’s attacks on Ken Starr’s Office of Independent Counsel constituted “a presidentially approved smear campaign,” “a disgraceful effort to undermine the rule of law,” and an effort to “disgrace [Starr and the independent counsel’s] office with a sustained propaganda campaign that would make Nixon blush.” Whitehouse wondered if Kavanaugh’s “views of presidential interference, or smearing of independent or special counsel, changed since you made those statements.” Kavanaugh’s response: “I think I’ve been clear, I don’t want to talk about current events.”
        
          • During Wednesday’s opening round of questioning, Harris asked Kavanaugh about President Trump’s statements that there was “blame on both sides” after a protester was killed during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last year. “I’m not here to assess comments made in the political arena, because the risk is I’ll be drawn into the political arena,” Kavanaugh responded.
        
          • Democratic Sen. Cory Booker asked Kavanaugh, “Do you still think character matters for the president of the United States?” Again, the nominee responded: “I need to stay so far away from political commentary. … Three ZIP codes.” When then asked if Kavanaugh would asked to be willing to repeat the statement he made about George W. Bush during his previous confirmation hearing and say he “respects” the president, Kavanaugh demurred.
        
          • Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if it was right for Trump to attack Judge Gonzalo Curiel for his Mexican heritage. “Again, I’m not going to comment on current events,” Kavanaugh’s responded. Blumenthal noted that President Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was willing to say that Trump’s attacks on the judiciary were “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” Asked if he agreed with Gorsuch’s comments, Kavanaugh refused to answer, saying he had to “stay well clear of political” controversies. (Perhaps Kavanaugh had read the Washington Post report indicating that Trump had discussed rescinding Gorsuch’s nomination after those comments because they weren’t “loyal” enough.)
        
          • During that same sequence, Blumenthal also asked Kavanaugh if he agreed with President Trump’s personal attacks on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “Do you believe that Justice Ginsburg has ‘embarrassed us all?’ ” Blumenthal asked. “I’m not going to get within three ZIP codes of a political controversy,” Kavanaugh responded.
        
          • In referencing Blumenthal’s testimony, Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono got to a bigger-picture point. “Is disagreeing with the president a concern to you?” she asked. “We don’t comment on politics, we don’t comment on comments made by politicians. We stay out, way away from politics,” Kavanaugh responded.
        
          Here, then, is a condensed list of what Kavanaugh considers to be political questions: whether it is possible to disagree with President Trump; whether Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an “incompetent judge” who has “embarrassed us all”; whether attacking a judge for his Mexican heritage is acceptable; whether the president’s character matters; whether anti-Nazi protesters share moral culpability with Nazis themselves; whether daily presidential attacks on a special counsel are acceptable; whether the president can order torture worse than waterboarding; and whether he can order the prosecution of his political enemies and command that prosecutions of his political allies be dropped.
        
          That last point is not some absurd hypothetical. Trump has repeatedly requested that his Department of Justice go after his enemies and drop the “witch hunt” investigations centering on the president and his friends. This week, it emerged that one of Trump’s political targets, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, is under a grand jury investigation. It is impossible to ignore the fact that the president has repeatedly called for that investigation. Trump this week also attacked his own attorney general, who he is expected to fire, saying that Sessions failed to protect two Republican congressmen from corruption charges. “Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,” the president wrote. “Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff…… ”
        
          On Tuesday, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake questioned Kavanaugh about whether this tweet was appropriate. “Should a president be able to use his authority to pressure executive or independent agencies to carrying out directives for purely political purposes?” Flake asked.
        
          “I don’t think we want judges commenting on the latest political controversy,” Kavanaugh said.
        
          The principle that the Department of Justice does not exist to imprison the president’s personal and political enemies should not be a “controversial” question that must be hashed out in the “political arena.” In the very recent past it would not have been described as such by any nominee, Republican or Democratic. But for Trump’s Supreme Court justices, the rule of law will be debatable.

          The Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Friday to bring Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination to a full Senate vote after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake called for a weeklong FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations levied against the nominee before the final vote. President Trump authorized the supplemental investigation later in the day.
        
          Democrats and Kavanaugh’s accusers have been urging Senate leadership over the past two weeks to recruit a neutral third party such as the FBI to interview witnesses and find more evidence that could prove or refute the nominee’s assertions of innocence.
        
          To get a better sense of what exactly this time- and scope-limited FBI investigation might entail, I spoke to Barbara McQuade, a University of Michigan Law professor who formerly served as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Here is a transcript of the interview, condensed and lightly edited for clarity.
        
          Aaron Mak: Does a week seem like enough time for the FBI to do this investigation?  
        
          Barbara McQuade: It does for this. I think they could probably do it in an even shorter period of time, like a few days. A week is reasonable because then if they are to reach out to these people tomorrow, they don’t have to say, “Drop everything and meet with me.” It gives them a few days to find the person, to meet with them, and then to write up the report. It’s a short turnaround time, but this has a finite scope. This is not asking Robert Mueller to conduct an investigation with long, complex ties to a foreign country. It’s a handful of people they’d like to interview.
        
          How will the FBI approach the investigation? Who’s involved? 
        
          What usually happens is that someone would take ownership and come up with a list of the people who ought to be interviewed. This is usually what they call a “case agent,” who’s in charge of the investigation. I would imagine that someone from the Washington Field Office of the FBI would be charged with coming up with the list. Then they send leads to the local office where the people are located.
        
          So they come up with the list. Say it’s Mark Judge and there are other people in Maryland, people in California, people wherever. They would then send a lead to those local offices: “Hey, California office, I would like you to interview these two people. Hey, Maryland office, here’s three for you. Hey, D.C. office, here’s two for you.” The FBI is a national law enforcement organization and has the benefit of agents all over the country. When they send those leads, they then assign them to an agent in that local office.
        
          I’ve been involved in FBI background investigations both for myself and as someone who’s a witness for others, like judges. Frequently what will happen is that I’ll get a call from an FBI agent who will say, “I’m conducting an FBI background investigation of Person X. Could I come talk to you tomorrow, because they’ve only given me two days to do this investigation.”
        
          It wouldn’t surprise me if they send several agents to conduct these interviews, reach out to these people, and arrange to meet sometime in the next few days. The agent will then go out to visit them at their home or an FBI office or a coffee shop—wherever is convenient. Then they have a long series of questions that have already been written out on a list.
        
          Is there any other evidence that they’d be looking for, beyond interviewing witnesses? 
        
          I think they would be purely interviewing witnesses. It’s unlikely that there’s any physical evidence remaining from a sexual assault attempt that may or may not have happened over 30 years ago. Although it’s been suggested that Judge Kavanaugh should submit to a polygraph test, I think that would be highly unlikely and highly unusual. Polygraphs are used to assess the credibility of witnesses and defendants, but to ask him to do that strikes me as something they probably won’t do.
        
          What stands out to you as the most promising lines of inquiry?
        
          Mark Judge strikes me as the most interesting person here. He has seemed to work pretty hard to not testify. Judge Kavanaugh has seemed to be very uninterested in an FBI investigation. It makes me wonder why and what else could be out there.
        
          I would think that Mark Judge would be pretty high on the list to ask him. He seems to be a person who could be very critical to the outcome here, especially in light of Dr. Ford’s testimony yesterday that when she saw him several weeks after the alleged incident, instead of greeting her the way he normally did, his face got white. It suggested to her that he was remembering the incident. If he remembered it then, might he still remember it today?
        
          [After this interview was conducted, Mark Judge’s lawyer released a statement reading, “If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge’s cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him.”]
        
          There are also the people who submitted affidavits on behalf of Dr. Ford, who said she discussed it with them many years after it happened but before Brett Kavanaugh’s name was known to the public. That could be of interest. There’s a rule of evidence that says that ordinarily those statements are hearsay, but they are allowed when someone offers them to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility has been attacked.
        
          What kind of report will the FBI produce in the end?
        
          They’re known as FBI 302s, named after the form on which they used to be printed. The agents write a report of the interview and it’s really just facts. It doesn’t provide any analysis. It’ll just say, “On such and such date, on such and such time, I interviewed the witness at this location. I first identified myself as an agent and warned them that lying is a crime.” And then they would proceed to summarize all of the things that the person said.
        
          Kavanaugh and others suggested during yesterday’s hearing that we’re not going to find out that much more from an FBI investigation, especially since a lot of these witnesses have sent in statements. Do you think that’s true? 
        
          I don’t buy that. As we saw in the testimony of Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, live testimony and questioning is so much more probative than written answers. Written answers can be drafted either with the assistance of, or entirely by, a lawyer. There’s no opportunity for follow-up questions.
        
          There’s no opportunity to look at tone and observe inflection and body language. It could be what allows an experienced questioner to follow up on things. I don’t know if they will assess the credibility in the report, but as they ask questions, they might say, “You paused there. Why did you pause? Let’s go back over that. Are you sure you’re accurate when you say X, Y, and Z?” They can use what they’re observing to ask meaningful follow-up questions. Going out and making these observations and interviewing these people with follow-up questions could be revealing.
        
          And I think even if it’s not, the process is very important. Even if they say, “We talked to all these people, here’s the information, and we still can’t reach a conclusion as to what happened,” I think it will satisfy at least some people who want there to be a fair process. It would satisfy me that they have done all they can do to investigate this matter. To go through this for just one week and thoroughly investigate all that we know would give people some comfort and help maintain the legitimacy of the court that has to decide issues of credibility and literally issues of life and death in capital cases.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-elizabeth-rasor-contradicts-mark-judges-claims-about-sexual-misconduct-at-georgetown-prep.html,"
          Buried inside the New Yorker’s bombshell story on a second woman coming forward to allege sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a disturbing paragraph about the hard-drinking culture at his high school. The New Yorker quotes Elizabeth Rasor, who was in a relationship with Kavanaugh’s high school classmate and friend Mark Judge for three years, contradicting his claim that he couldn’t recall any type of sexual aggression toward girls.*
        
          Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a drunken party while Judge was in the room. As Ford tells it, Judge at points even egged Kavanaugh on, telling him to “go for it” as he tried to remove her clothing. Judge has said he has “no recollection of the incident” and has characterized the allegations as completely unrealistic and out of character. “I can recall a lot of rough-housing with guys,” he said in an interview with the Weekly Standard. “I don’t remember any of that stuff going on with girls.”
        
          Rasor, however, says that’s not true and is coming forward to contradict his claim. “Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t reveal information that was told in confidence,” Rasor said. But she said that “I can’t stand by and watch him lie.” The New Yorker summarizes why Rasor says Judge was being disingenuous claiming that there weren’t incidents of “rough-housing” with female students at Georgetown Prep:
        
          Judge’s lawyer says he “categorically denies” Rasor’s claim.
        
          But Rasor isn’t alone. Another woman, who asked to remain anonymous, also disputed Judge’s claims about the culture at Georgetown Prep. She said that it was common for male students to “get a female student blind drunk” on a mixture of grain alcohol and Hawaiian Punch that they called “jungle juice” and then try to take advantage of her. “It was disgusting,” she said. “They treated women like meat.” Judge has told the Senate Judiciary Committee he doesn’t want to testify about Ford’s allegations.

          Brett Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday an angry, vengeful man. He was belligerent and partisan, blaming allegations of sexual misconduct on a conspiracy of Democrats and “leftists” on behalf of “the Clintons.” He was curt and dismissive, shouting over Democratic committee members. And he was evasive and dishonest, answering pertinent questions about alcohol consumption with petulant dissembling. “Yes, we drank beer. My friends and I, the boys and girls. Yes, we drank beer. I liked beer. Still like beer,” he said in response to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. In one exchange with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, he mockingly asked her (later apologizing) if she ever drank to excess, a major breach of decorum for the subject of a hearing, let alone a federal judge.
        
          All of this was for an audience of one: President Donald Trump, who wanted Kavanaugh to fight back, given his own experience with allegations of sexual assault, which he continues to minimize and dismiss despite a large number of credible accusers. It worked. Trump was reportedly enthralled with Kavanaugh’s testimony and followed it with a declaration of support. “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,” he said on Twitter. “His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!” Republicans on the committee, bolstered by a similarly angry broadside from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham during the hearing, doubled down on Kavanaugh, attacking Democrats for the process behind Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations and condemning their questioning of Kavanaugh as a disgrace to the reputation of the Senate itself.
        
          On Friday, Kavanaugh was advanced by the committee on a party-line vote. But in a surprise, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake asked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to postpone the full Senate vote to allow for an additional FBI investigation. After Flake spoke to the full Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lisa Murkowski declared her support for the delay, which means Kavanaugh may not right now have the votes for confirmation.
        
          It is impossible to say what will happen next. Kavanaugh’s confirmation is still likely, but it isn’t certain. But however this drama ends, it’s been a mess. With his furious partisanship and snarling anger, Kavanaugh is now an extraordinarily toxic nominee. And the raw exercise of power behind his confirmation is itself a powerful blow to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.
        
          This turn of events wasn’t inevitable. Trump had other, credible, conservative nominees for the Supreme Court. And he might have been able to confirm them with some Democratic support, putting a bipartisan stamp on his judicial legacy. But while Trump brags frequently about his judicial record, he’s unengaged with the details of vetting and selecting nominees. Kavanaugh, like prior nominee Neil Gorsuch, had been placed on Trump’s short list by key adviser Leonard Leo, a major figure in the Federalist Society, a nationwide organization of conservative lawyers. Leo singled out his old friend Kavanaugh as a top contender for the Supreme Court seat left by Justice Anthony Kennedy and made his recommendation to the president. To the extent that Trump was engaged with the process, it was likely in response to Kavanaugh’s expansive views of executive authority and belief that presidents should be shielded from criminal investigation while in office.
        
          After nominating him, Trump was hands off, ceding responsibility of vetting and selling the nominee to his advisers as well as Republican leaders in Congress. Which meant he was already disengaged as it became clear that Kavanaugh was an unpopular nominee facing an unusually difficult time in the Senate Judiciary Committee and was blindsided by the anger following Ford’s allegations. It’s only since those allegations that Trump has shown any real interest in Kavanaugh’s nomination, and then, it has been to pressure Republicans into an unyielding defensive crouch, even as Kavanaugh’s standing slipped with the public.
        
          By yielding to the president on Kavanaugh and not pressuring Trump to withdraw him and send up a different nominee for easier confirmation, Senate Republicans have contributed to the poisoned atmosphere around this nomination process. McConnell, in particular, is so preoccupied with winning Kavanaugh’s confirmation that he has led his caucus into a situation where putting him on the bench might spark an unprecedented backlash in the upcoming midterm elections. And even if a Kavanaugh confirmation doesn’t change the short-term electoral picture, there are long-run consequences to pushing a divisive, partisan nominee into a powerful lifetime position.
        
          Given the already unprecedented blockade of Merrick Garland, the presence of a Justice Kavanaugh would, for millions of voters, cement the Supreme Court as a narrow, factional power, meant to enhance one political party at the expense of another. In response, liberals may push for radical solutions that alter or dilute the power of the court, from impeaching Kavanaugh to expanding and “packing” the court with new members. Either move would bring about an institutional arms race, as parties responded with ever-escalating reforms.
        
          With Brett Kavanaugh, what began as an almost typical Supreme Court nomination has become a singular event in modern American life, a point from which our politics will become even more polarized. We still can’t say if he’ll win confirmation, but we can say that his performance heralds the widening of our partisan fault lines.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/quinnipiac-poll-kavanaugh-popularity-independents-women-democrats.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh’s unpopularity has surged since he and Christine Blasey Ford gave testimony on Thursday, a Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed. About 48 percent of voters do not want Kavanaugh to be confirmed, compared with 42 percent who do. The new results, drawn from a survey conducted Thursday through Sunday, contrast with an earlier poll showing 42–41 percent opposition to his confirmation.
        
          The biggest shift didn’t come from Republicans changing their minds about supporting Kavanaugh, but instead from independents, who went from 45–39 support earlier in September to 49–39 opposition.
        
          The gender gaps in support for Kavanaugh mirrored the large and growing gender sorting of the two major parties. Women were opposed 55 percent to 37 percent, while men supported Kavanaugh 49 percent to 40 percent.
        
          While the overwhelming majority of the Senate has made up its mind on whether to vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation, every day that passes until the final vote is a new day for new damaging information to come out, for the existing claims against Kavanugh to be corroborated, or for negative polling data to pile up—any of which could influence the final decision of Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, or Joe Manchin, the senators whose votes are considered in play.
        
          Another major trend—weak approval for both political parties, the president, and Congress—was also reflected in the poll: Majorities of respondents disapproved of how both Republicans and Democrats handled the allegations, while 49 to 42 percent disapproved of how Trump has dealt with the situation.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-hearing-angry-shouting.html,"
          Thursday’s Judiciary Committee hearing was a study in contrasts whose differences were oddly erased by their result. Christine Blasey Ford seemed terrified but brimmed with goodwill. The extent of her cooperation is measurable: She went to great lengths to be as painfully precise as she could be, clarifying her comments at every turn. She was considerate of the committee and answered every question, repeatedly going out of her way to offer more than was asked. Her effort to comply under difficult circumstances was unrelenting, even as she downplayed the negative effects of all this on herself and her family. (Asked how her husband and children were doing, she said they were basically “OK.”) She came across as dedicated, responsible, and motivated by a sincere desire to help.
        
          She was called credible by most observers.
        
          Brett Kavanaugh launched his half of the proceedings without an iota of graciousness or respect for the body charged with advancing his confirmation. He began yelling his grievances at the committee. Though this may have been intended in part to be strategic, his demeanor quickly careened away from controlled chaos to just chaos as he attacked the committee’s Democrats in a hissing second person, his mouth curled in a sneer of contempt: “You have tried hard. You’ve given it your all. No one can question your efforts. Your coordinated and well-funded efforts to destroy my good name and destroy my family will not drag me out.” He used phrases like lying in wait. Take me out. So shocking was it to see a judge abandon reason and decorum in order to lob accusations and float conspiracies—at Americans whose offense was requesting that a serious charge against him be investigated—that many watching thought he must be about to withdraw from consideration. But no. He did not admit defeat in a blaze of glory. He denied, he attacked, and he obstructed, all the while making himself the victim of a proceeding he would later repeatedly claim to respect.
        
          He, too, was called credible.
        
          This, in short, is the power of anger: who gets to use it, and how it’s misread.
        
          Vox charted the actual number of questions answered by each witness. See for yourself whether—per the actual information each offered—it’s appropriate or fair to call them equally candid. So, what happened? Why would some rush to call Kavanaugh authentic and sincere when his testimony brimmed with sarcasm and scorn? In a culture that instructs men to hide their emotions, this is the unfortunate side effect: a tendency to see anger—male anger, specifically—as a sign of candor because it’s broken through the wall of repression. Male outrage frequently functions—in our clumsy social calculus as outside observers—as a proxy with which we gauge a man’s honesty and even righteousness.
        
          This means that anger is the kind of weapon that works on more fronts than we’re necessarily aware of. Rage, like tears, can be exploited for sympathy—but only in certain hands.
        
          Kavanaugh’s performance wasn’t exactly a surprise: I’ve written about what I see as Kavanaugh’s strategy, which is to exaggerate his innocence in every matter, big or small, counting on male support while tailoring his personal conduct so as to earn the approval of his latest target. In his TV interview, Brett Kavanaugh believed he needed to be a buttoned-down choirboy for the Fox News audience he hoped to win over. He sat with his mostly silent wife and portrayed himself as a nice, quiet, decent man. On Thursday, his intended audience had changed: It was now Trump. The president prefers those who are more like him, so Brett Kavanaugh obliged. He shouted and sobbed, insulted half the country, and claimed the system was rigged, tying Ford’s allegation that he assaulted her into (I can’t believe I’m typing this) “revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.” It was an appalling, partisan, unhinged display. But it worked as intended: The president called it “riveting”!
        
          To be clear, I don’t doubt the sincerity of Kavanaugh’s anger. No one doubts (least of all me) that Brett Kavanaugh feels passionately sorry for himself. He wanted this confirmation badly, and my impression— while watching that damp, extraordinary tantrum—was that he hasn’t had much experience coping with not getting what he wants. One can lightly sympathize: For a judge accustomed to holding other people accountable for their behavior, having the public combing through his yearbooks and asking about his drinking and sex life would not be pleasant. That is unfortunate. It is unpleasant, too, to be accused of assault. But his inability to cope is not, perhaps, what one looks for in a Supreme Court justice. This isn’t a trial; it’s a high-profile job interview for a big promotion. But it’s worth noting anyway that conduct like his wouldn’t be acceptable from a run-of-the-mill defendant—even one who was falsely accused—for whom the stress and stakes would be infinitely higher. We expect ordinary people in those circumstances to comport themselves with a modicum of dignity and restraint. For a lifetime appointment, one would think the standards for conduct and temperament would be rather higher, but Kavanaugh ground those expectations into the dust with his heel and stomped on them.
        
          But the funny thing about male anger, no matter how pouty or infantile, is that people respect it. Many have pointed out that if Christine Blasey Ford—a woman whose only crime is coming forward with information she thought was useful to the American public before Brett Kavanaugh was even the nominee, and whose reward was to be inundated with threats and forced out of her home—had shown even a tenth of the anger Kavanaugh felt himself free to express, she’d have been compromised. Female anger is not only disapproved of; it’s read as essentially wrongheaded, a sign of pathology and brokenness. (See the “angry feminist” trope—the implication is that the anger is unwarranted.) Ford’s anger would have contaminated her motives. Given the reactions to Kavanaugh’s tirade, however, it’s clear that many still regard male anger as not just not acceptable but as corroborating: the fact of his inappropriate outburst somehow proves the legitimacy of whatever aroused it. Kavanaugh is angry, so what he’s angry about must be true! The illogic of this should be self-evident; it’s laughable, certainly, to anyone who has had to live with an unstable and angry man.
        
          But people with a level of entitlement (as well as abusers) do see themselves as the victims—they’re not lying about that. They’re often mild-mannered and nice so long as no one tries to exert any authority over them. When confronted, they lash out. Jennifer Freyd at the University of Oregon has called this familiar pattern of behavior DARVO: Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender. I’ll note here that I’m not sure how well this maps onto Kavanaugh’s behavior, and I’m not making any presumption about abuse. Still, this strategy must be better understood, because it has something in common with the president’s conduct too. And while abuse has been researched, everyday male anger still seems to benefit from the assumption that there’s always a rational link between the anger and what caused it. Men are angry for good reason. This reflexive rationalization of male anger—our sense that it is somehow honest, if not always proportionate—deserves a long, hard look. Kavanaugh’s emotional outbursts were not proof of his authenticity, or of his honesty, or of the extremity of his suffering. The infamous yearbook incident is, I regret to say, a good demonstration of this.
        
          Before the hearing, I wrote about what Kavanaugh’s lie about the “Renate Alumnius” caption under a photo of himself as well as the photos of some other football players said about Kavanaugh’s relationship to male networks. To my astonishment, he lied about that stupid ugly joke again, under oath. He got choked up during his opening statement—tears as sincerity—as he blamed everyone for misunderstanding what was, he insisted, a sweet gesture of inclusion. “That yearbook reference was clumsily meant to show affection, that she was one of us,” he said. Curiously, he and his friends never showed this touching homage (which shows up over a dozen times) to the person for whom it was allegedly intended. Renate did not know about the entry when she signed the letter of support affirming Kavanaugh’s respectful treatment of women. And she was understandably horrified when she did learn, because another guy in the group had included this poem in the yearbook: “You need a date/ and it’s getting late/ so don’t hesitate/ to call Renate.” Hardly a sweet gesture of inclusion.
        
          I hadn’t expected Kavanaugh to double down on this particular lie because it was just so dumb. Yes, his strategy up to that point had been to overshoot with his denials, but at least he admitted (many times) in the hearing to “liking” beer. There were signs, in other words, that he was willing to abandon at least some of his virtuous fictions about himself.
        
          I was wrong. Kavanaugh did not admit that he and his buddies made a cruel, dumb joke. Instead, he lied. And cried about it. And railed against the injustice of being so maliciously misunderstood. That tells us something about how much we can trust the relationship between his emotional displays and his truthfulness.
        
          For a hearing that was specifically engineered to yield nothing conclusive—no witnesses questioned, no experts, no FBI investigation done—the spectacle was nonetheless instructive. It isn’t often that you get to see a nominee lose control, nor do you get to watch them regain their composure. Here, we got to see both: Kavanaugh eventually got a hold of himself. I’ve suggested that the allegations made about Kavanaugh, if they are true, paint the picture of a man who firms up his bond with other men however he can, sometimes by laughing at shared cruelty to women. It surprised me yesterday to see anger serving a similar in-group function in the halls of the Capitol, in front of a national audience. Kavanaugh settled down from his fever pitch, yes, but only once the male GOP senators displayed anger on his behalf, questioning him directly and scuttling the female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, whom they’d used as a go-between for all of Ford’s session and only part of Kavanaugh’s. As Sen. John Cornyn said after the hearing, they’d ditched Mitchell because the senators wanted to make arguments “that she frankly was not equipped to make.” She certainly wasn’t. The moment Kavanaugh started to find his footing and regain his composure was during Sen. Lindsey Graham’s own equally partisan and bizarre tantrum.
        
          Before his ruffled feathers got smoothed, Kavanaugh had been impatient and angry, particularly when he was being questioned by women. He yelled at Sen. Dianne Feinstein, interrupted her, and yelled again. He was snappish and ungracious to Mitchell, the GOP prosecutor on his side. He refused to say he wanted an FBI investigation—repeating ad nauseam that he respected the committee’s decision and process—but that respect was less than evident when he had a female questioner. Graham helped calm him, but Sen. Klobuchar’s questions got him riled up again. He initially singled her out for praise, but when she asked him whether he’d ever drunk so much that he couldn’t remember what happened, he snapped. “I don’t know,” Kavanaugh sneered. “Have you?”
        
          It was aggressive and disrespectful. He apologized to her after a break (clearly someone had chastened him), but his instincts were perfectly clear.
        
          Rage, like a microphone, can really only be held by one person at a time in these settings. Different people picked it up at different times during the hearing—Kavanaugh most of all—but its persuasive function was pretty obvious. The group that most effectively performed anger got to seem more honest, more righteous, more wronged. That group was male and Republican.
        
          That rage became, if not exactly a bond, a shared ethos. The second half of the hearing became a blear of angry Republican men apologizing to Kavanaugh and furiously condemning the very process they devised as being “unfair”—even as they repeatedly refused to change it by, for example, reopening the FBI background investigation or interviewing the relevant witnesses. It was a bad-faith performance, but they performed it so angrily that plenty of people found it stirring and sincere.
        
          This was not a path available to Ford. She did everything she needed to do, and more, with striking composure. Kavanaugh came off raging, paranoid, petulant, obstructionist. Yet afterward, their testimonies were treated as if they had been exactly equal and opposite. All her effort. All her control and precision and goodwill. All her sacrifice, for nothing. Her quiet pleas for a full investigation were erased by a manic flurry of bellowed indignation.
        
          This hearing offered indirect evidence, then, of how much we value male anger, and how little we rate female sadness. Women and men who have been sexually victimized have torn themselves open, laying bare their most traumatic experiences in an attempt to educate those in power on what this is, how it works, how it hurts. On Thursday, it didn’t matter. There was no performance so credible and sympathetic on Ford’s part that would have made a difference to these men, and no performance so unhinged by Kavanaugh that would have changed their vote. This is bad for the court. If Kavanaugh is confirmed after that disqualifying display, in which he lied under oath, spewed partisan invective, and disrespected female questioners, the Supreme Court as an American institution will no longer be able to sustain even the fiction of its legitimacy.
        
          There may be lessons here for the rest of us about anger and the way it is used and interpreted. As observers, we probably need to learn to uncouple male anger (or tears) from sincerity—or to at least apply as much skepticism as we do to angry women. For another, there’s no point in containing one’s anger anymore. If a potential Supreme Court justice can behave that way, so can the rest of us. Bottling one’s rage into an acceptable social performance is enormous labor, and we’ve learned this week that it’s not worth doing. It does not work. All it does is condense the rage into a numbing grief that erodes the self and weakens the will to action. If this is how it’s going to be, lesson learned.
        
          There are lessons for Republicans, too, should they want them. When you break a system so badly that even an unimpeachable performance by a credible witness fails to be taken seriously, you play an extremely dangerous game. A small number of senators may have been able to force a delay in the confirmation vote, but Thursday has made its mark. Kavanaugh said it himself: “You sowed the wind for decades to come. I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwinds.” The hearing revealed what the way forward must be: Anger is less than a truth test, but it’s also more than a feeling. It’s a strategy and a tool. And women’s anger must come out. We’ve been left no other choice.

          If we learned anything at all from John McCain’s funeral over the weekend it’s this: The more buffeted we are by the hourly insanity that emanates from the Trump White House, the more likely we are to get bleary-eyed drunk on episodes of public sobriety, dignity, and seriousness. As Michelle Goldberg aptly noted, “For many who detest Donald Trump, the spectacle of the country’s former leaders championing embattled American principles—principles once shared by even the bitterest political enemies—was fiercely moving.” Moving, yes, but at what cost?
        
          The more corruption, incompetence, and recklessness we witness spewing out of the White House, the more inclined we are to cling tightly to the blanket of institutional integrity, normalcy, and civility. It’s not just that it’s nuts out there. It’s almost as if the nuttier it gets, the more we need to pretend that wherever it is we’re sitting at the moment is a safe place in which the norms of dignity, respect, and goodwill are still in force. And if John McCain’s funeral was a symbol of that, so too is all the talk of “decorum” and “civility” in the U.S. Senate.
        
          And so, Republicans spent the first day of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings telling us that nothing that’s happening in here has anything to do with the fact that Donald Trump is the president. None of the concern around this Supreme Court seat has anything to do with the fact that the president himself is under investigation for corruption and campaign finance violations, or that his personal lawyer swore under oath that Trump instructed him to commit crimes, or that a foreign power is currently interfering with our election systems. All of that is about a different thing. This hearing is about something stable and immutable and good. And anyone who implies that anything is abnormal is a hysteric or an opportunist or an attention-seeker.
        
          Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse can go so far as to express mild concern about Trump’s assaults on the rule of law and his own attorney general because none of that has anything to do with Brett Kavanaugh. And Lindsey Graham can splutter about Hillary Clinton because that also has nothing to do with Kavanaugh. And Chuck Grassley can snarl that this is akin to attacking the president because it has nothing whatsoever to do with the president.
        
          If you followed Tuesday’s events on a split screen, you’d know that in addition to issuing threats to his own attorney general and making claims that Republicans running for office deserve different legal treatment than Democrats, Trump was also the subject of jaw-dropping leaks in Bob Woodward’s new book, leaks suggesting his own aides must take documents off his desk in order to keep the United States safe from his rampant incompetence. But inside the cocoon of the Senate Judiciary Committee, none of that matters at all. Moreover, for legal luminaries like Ted Cruz, this hearing is an extraordinary opportunity to celebrate the greatness of Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. This is still a safe space, of civility and decorum, and the Democrats who squawk about documents being withheld have descended into “mob rule” and incivility.
        
          The White House (the White House!) was tweeting indignantly about interruptions. By the end of the day Trump himself was tweeting that all Senate Democrats were “mean, angry, and despicable.” But even with the president forcing himself into the Senate’s aperture yet again, by no means should anyone who works there take any steps to rein him in. That would be weird. And while most of the senators had the good graces on Tuesday to pretend that Trump was not really the president, some evinced a kind of nagging low-level worry that someone somewhere should really address the problem of a chief executive who doesn’t believe in law or courts or justice. But who? Who could possibly do it?
        
          Flake described “concern” about Donald Trump’s attacks on the rule of law. And Sasse deplored the do-nothing Congress. And Chuck Grassley (yes, this Chuck Grassley) bemoaned the fact that Senate Democrats were taking advantage of his “decency and integrity.” But everyone on the Republican side of the aisle felt confident that it was Democrats who were breaking the Senate on Tuesday.
        
          On the Democratic side, Dick Durbin decried the fact that a Republican lawyer was vetting all of the Kavanaugh documents, and Amy Klobuchar expressed the sentiment that nothing about this hearing was regular. “This is not normal,” she said. “You have a nominee with excellent credentials, with his family behind him. You have the cameras there. You have the senators questioning. But this isn’t normal.” Mazie Hirono made the same point: “These are not normal times.”
        
          Indeed, for a brief time on Tuesday morning as the Democrats demanded postponement and adjournment, it appeared they might walk out of the chamber altogether. But ultimately, the need for regularity and normalcy overmastered even them, and so while their opening statements grew longer and more irate, the decision to stick around and litigate this thing on the merits proved too tempting. It was left to the protesters, one after another in unprecedented numbers and with unprecedented ferocity, to voice their disgust and dismay. The more furious the calls for “decorum” and “rules” and “politeness,” the more enraged the protesters became. The opposite of civility isn’t always civil disagreement.
        
          In the furious national quest for decency and normalcy, the day ended as a parody of itself—with Kavanaugh feted by a “liberal feminist” lawyer for his legal greatness that transcends all politics and ideology, and the judge himself offering his girls’ basketball coaching as an argument about human decency in a cruel and frightening world.
        
          If the McCain funeral proved anything, it’s that we take so much visceral succor in public performances of bipartisanship and decency that we can blinker ourselves to genuine injustice, injustice we don’t see because it happens outside our scope of vision. We need balanced, functioning institutions so desperately that we gorge ourselves on performances of friendship and family and civility.
        
          We must be extra cautious, now more than ever, about institutions that substitute talk of norms and civility for actual justice. Senate Republicans are rushing the Kavanaugh hearing, and blocking access to his record, precisely because they would rather prey on the national need for normalcy and dignity than do anything to reaffirm the rule of law as it applies to this presidency. Yet again the crumbling of democratic safeguards is someone else’s problem. Sometimes calls for institutional decency and civility mask institutional cowardice and opportunism. The first day of Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings was one of those times.

          The Brett Kavanaugh who showed up at the Senate on Thursday afternoon was not the Brett Kavanaugh who came to Capitol Hill for the first four days of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Then, he was cautious and even-keeled, coyly demurring when asked for his opinion on issues that might reveal his political leanings. On Thursday, he came out shouting—flushed and indignant about the sexual assault accusations that have been lodged against him by Christine Blasey Ford and two other women. He looked like nothing more than a child who’d been called in front of a school disciplinary board for misbehavior, the perfect picture of a privileged, physically imposing teen.
        
          It was more than a little surreal to see the composed federal judge, a 53-year-old man who’s foregrounded his skills as a carpool driver and children’s basketball coach, transform into a petulant prep school jock. His arms crossed, eyes rolling, lips pursed into a smirk, Kavanaugh dropped his veneer of decorum to talk back to the Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee—every one of whom he interrupted—as if they were meting out a particularly harsh grounding.
        
          One of Kavanaugh’s college roommates, James Roche, has described the judge as someone who’d get “aggressive and belligerent” when he drank, which, Roche said, happened often. Thursday’s performance gave us a glimpse of what an aggressive belligerent Kavanaugh looks like. He yelled over ranking member Dianne Feinstein about wanting to hold a hearing the day after Ford came forward with her allegations. When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse asked him about the yearbook entries that appeared to illustrate heavy drinking, Kavanaugh interrupted and shot back, “Do you like beer? What do you like to drink? Senator, what do you like to drink?” Twice, Kavanaugh asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spoke about her father’s struggle with alcoholism, if she’d ever blacked out from drinking, as a way to avoid answering the same question she posed to him. (He later apologized to Klobuchar for his behavior.)
        
          Every argument Kavanaugh made about his high school behavior sounded like an argument that would come out of the mouth of a high-schooler. Son, what is the meaning of this line in your yearbook about a girl name Renate? That was “intended to show affection, and that she was one of us.” And the “Beach Week Ralph Club”? Just a “sensitive stomach” thing. Did you drink so much that you passed out? No, just “fell asleep.”
        
          Throughout his testimony, Kavanaugh tried to prove his decency through elitist associations and self-exonerating invocations of privilege. He couldn’t have spent his nights drinking to excess and molesting young women, he said, because he was busy playing on the football team, spending time “at Tobin’s house workin’ out,” passing the weekends in an upper-crust beach community, and getting into Yale. At other times, he spoke a language specific to boisterous prankster bros, laughing about Roche moving their mutual roommate’s furniture out of their dorm room and asking Whitehouse if he’d ever played the drinking game quarters.
        
          As the end of the hearing approached, with just two GOP senators left to question him, Kavanaugh turned solicitous. He was no longer snipping and shouting, but somberly nodding, giving polite answers of “yes, senator” as everyone made a show of agreeing on how bad sexual assault is and how unfair Democrats had been to Ford and Kavanaugh’s family. If you didn’t catch the first half of his testimony, you might think this was the full picture of a respectful, respectable guy who really likes beer but is incapable of grievous harm. Here, Kavanaugh behaved like a teenager who knows he’s nearing the end of a lecture from a parent or headmaster, humbling himself for the final few minutes because he realizes his pedigree will preclude any meaningful punishment.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-sexual-misconduct-high-school.html,"
          On Friday, the New Yorker finally revealed more details on the contents of a secret document that a woman had submitted to Rep. Anna Eshoo concerning Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The letter details the woman’s accusation that the nominee engaged in sexual misconduct against her while both were in high school. The report by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer alleges that the woman, who has not been identified and has asked for anonymity, wrote that “during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down” and “attempted to force himself on her.” It continues:
        
          Kavanaugh contested the claims in a statement, declaring: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.” His classmate told the New Yorker: “I have no recollection of that.”
        
          According to Farrow and Mayer, the letter was sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in July. The woman also reached out to Feinstein’s office directly. She eventually decided not to speak publicly about her accusation after watching Kavanaugh glide toward a seemingly inevitable confirmation, according to a source who spoke to the New Yorker.
        
          Feinstein’s handling of the letter created tension among Democratic members of the committee. The senator did not notify her Democratic colleagues about the allegations and refused to share the letter. Instead, Feinstein decided the accusation was “too distant in the past to merit public discussion,” Farrow and Mayer write, citing a source with knowledge of the decision. Feinstein reportedly felt that the committee should focus on “legal, rather than personal, issues” when questioning Kavanaugh, the source elaborated, and that, when pressed about the letter, Feinstein stated that she had “taken care of it.” The senator only briefed the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Democrats about the letter on Wednesday, “with no staff present.”
        
          That same day, Feinstein sent the information to the FBI, which told BuzzFeed News that “we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh’s background file, as per the standard process.” The agency also passed it on to the White House to assess. On Friday, in response to a query about the accusation, White House spokesman Raj Shah passed along Kavanaugh’s statement “categorically and unequivocally” denying the claim.
        
          Kavanaugh’s supporters began questioning the woman’s allegation shortly after the New Yorker story was published. Even the night before the story came out, Ed Whelan, who has been involved in the selection of Donald Trump’s judicial nominees and vigorously defended Kavanaugh, asked whether the accuser “will say she was sober at time of alleged incident at drinking party. If drunk, how drunk?”
        
          On Friday morning, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley released a letter from 65 women who knew Kavanaugh in high school that states that Kavanaugh “behaved honorably and treated women with respect.” The letter was clearly timed to counteract the New Yorker report; BuzzFeed News reported on Friday afternoon that Kavanaugh’s friends spearheaded it on Thursday in response to then-hazy allegations. It concluded:
        
          “The signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views. Many of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person. And he has always been a good person.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-julie-swetnick-maryland-investigation.html,"
          On Wednesday, attorney Michael Avenatti revealed a sworn declaration by his client, Julie Swetnick, alleging that, while in high school, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh targeted women for group sexual assault. Swetnick’s horrific allegations, put forth under penalty of perjury, describe “numerous boys” drugging and raping young women in Maryland during the early 1980s. Her declaration contradicts Kavanaugh’s statements while bolstering the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford, who claims a very drunken Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge sexually assaulted her around 1982.
        
          Swetnick’s allegations require a thorough investigation on the part of Maryland authorities. She is alleging nothing less than a conspiracy of sex abuse involving multiple rapists, none of whom, apparently, have faced any punishment for their reported crimes. It’s worth noting that, unlike earlier accusations against Kavanaugh, Swetnick’s story was not vetted by journalists. That makes an investigation all the more necessary. Without one, there will now be a cloud over every male student in a very broad social circle. Swetnick implies that some number of young men were at the very least aware of grave sexual abuse and did not report it. Her allegation cannot be ignored. And if it isn’t true, it should not be allowed to hang over this entire cohort indefinitely. At this point, an investigation isn’t optional.
        
          Swetnick’s declaration recounts alleged behavior on the part of Kavanaugh and others over the course of years. She claims that Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in persistent “inappropriate conduct,” including “the fondling and grabbing of girls without their consent.” Swetnick says that Kavanaugh and Judge would “spike” the punch at house parties with drugs or grain alcohol “to cause girls to lose their inhibitions.” They would, she alleges, “target” specific girls “so they could be taken advantage of.” She then states:
        
          Swetnick reports becoming “the victim of one of these ‘gang’ or ‘train’ rapes” where Judge and Kavanaugh “were present.” Her declaration does not clarify whether they participated in the alleged rape. She alleges she was drugged with Quaaludes “or something similar,” though she makes no claim regarding who may have drugged her.
        
          Here, Swetnick has accused multiple men of rape, attempted rape, and conspiracy to commit rape. Even those men who did not directly participate in the alleged rape could be liable as accomplices depending on the kind of behavior they engaged in. Maryland has no statute of limitations for any felony sex crime, meaning charges could be brought today. These laws reflect an affirmative choice by the Legislature to give victims more time to come forward. It would make no sense to claim that Swetnick, Ford, and others waited too long to report these alleged crimes when Maryland has crafted statutes designed to let them report whenever they choose.
        
          Moreover, Swetnick’s declaration expands the alleged crimes far beyond a single house party on one night in 1982. She asserts that Kavanaugh, Judge, and others engaged in “this conduct” in both Montgomery County, Maryland, and in Ocean City, across the state in Worcester County. Swetnick therefore alleges that these men committed crimes repeatedly, in multiple locations, in at least two jurisdictions within Maryland.
        
          Local authorities in both counties would now seem to be obliged to look into the claims made in Swetnick’s declaration. The Sentinel reported on Monday that government investigators are “looking at allegations made against Kavanaugh during his senior year in high school.” If true, that’s a start. But it’s not enough. Investigators in both Montgomery County and Worcester County should question Kavanaugh, Judge, and others who may be involved about Swetnick’s allegations. They should also speak to Swetnick herself to glean more details, including possible locations and co-conspirators.
        
          It is difficult to see why the men implicated in Swetnick’s statement wouldn’t also want a thorough investigation to exonerate them if they are innocent. Kavanaugh has already said he wants a “fair process,” and only law enforcement is equipped to handle charges of this nature. It is undoubtedly true that, as some Republican senators have noted, Avenatti has his own agenda. The just response, however, is not to disregard his client, but to urge official scrutiny of her claims.

          Now that Brett Kavanaugh is sitting on the Supreme Court, Christine Blasey Ford is no longer making daily headlines. But she’s still making money via GoFundMe, where one of two massively successful fundraising pages is still collecting donations for a no-strings-attached pot that currently contains more than $633,000.
        
          An Oct. 3 message from Ford on the page, which was initially set up by an anonymous person or people identified as “her neighbors and colleagues,” says the funds will be used for “security, housing, transportation and other related expenses” incurred as a result of her public sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. “I cannot express how grateful I am for the outpouring of support and generosity that we have received through this GoFundMe account,” Ford wrote in that message, adding, “I feel like all of you who have made a contribution are on this journey with me, which is very heartening.”
        
          Ford received multiple death threats after putting her name to a confidential letter she’d sent to her congressional representative detailing an attempted rape Kavanaugh allegedly perpetrated against her in the early 1980s. The money from two Ford-affiliated GoFundMe pages (the second stopped accepting money on Sept. 20, when it had amassed nearly $210,000) was raised based on the promise that it would help defray the cost of a security detail. “The costs for security, housing, transportation and other related expenses are much higher than we anticipated and they do not show signs of letting up,” she said in the Oct. 3 message.
        
          On Monday, the investigations arm of the right-leaning website RealClearPolitics published a piece suggesting these fundraising efforts may explain why Ford accused Kavanaugh of assault. “Democrats repeatedly asserted that Christine Blasey Ford had ‘nothing to gain’ by coming forward with her explosive accusation of attempted rape against the Supreme Court nominee,” reporter Paul Sperry writes. “In fact, Ford stands to gain some $1 million and counting from national crowdfunding campaigns launched by friends and other supporters, while she is said to be fielding book offers.” Sperry casts doubt on the idea that Ford and her husband need donations, noting that they own two homes valued at a combined $4.3 million, sold a bed-and-breakfast a decade ago for more than $1.5 million, and hold well-paying gigs in academia and biotechnology, respectively. Sperry also questions where the GoFundMe money is going, since Ford’s lawyers offered their services pro bono. He estimates that Ford could have spent only about $55,000 on security so far and claims she’s been staying with relatives and at her beach house, not in any rented safe house she’d have to shell out for.
        
          Sperry doesn’t explain where he got the $1 million figure—the two GoFundMe sums add up to about $840,000, and a third fundraiser that’s garnered about $31,000 is earmarked for a proposed endowed professorship or scholarship that wouldn’t enrich Ford at all. And there is a large, meaningful distance between having something “to gain” from coming forward with sexual assault allegations and accepting material gestures of gratitude. I do not believe Ford lied about a sexual assault in hopes that someone would make her a GoFundMe. With that said, it does make me a little uncomfortable to watch more than 13,000 people give money to an already-wealthy woman for unspecified expenses related to a sexual assault accusation when so many other survivors are trying to get by with far greater need and far less social, institutional, and financial support.
        
          Crowdfunding sites have made it easy for people to convert feelings of sympathy into monetary gifts. Occasionally, well-meaning attempts to help the victim of targeted mistreatment or random tragedy go viral, bringing the beneficiary a major windfall. When 68-year-old bus monitor Karen Klein was captured on tape getting taunted by a group of boys in 2012, a random man who saw the video started an Indiegogo campaign with the goal of raising $5,000 to send Klein on the “vacation of a lifetime.” It ended up yielding more than $700,000, effectively setting her up for retirement, or a year of lavish spending, or whatever else she might want to do. Klein left her job and used $100,000 of the money to set up an anti-bullying foundation that stopped posting updates in 2013. It’s hard to escape the notion that, while Klein absolutely deserved the vacation of a lifetime, the extra $695,000 could have gone to better use elsewhere—say, to existing organizations doing anti-bullying work, or to pay the medical and counseling expenses incurred by victims of hate crimes.
        
          The same goes for the $840,000 donated to Ford. If Ford isn’t part of the 1 percent, she’s darn close, and it’s highly probable that the majority of her patrons have less money than she does. The donors to these campaigns were surely motivated by feelings of helplessness and anger. For some of her backers, Ford was an avatar of their painful memories of sexual exploitation; for others, she represented their fears of women’s fate under three Republican-controlled branches of government. They couldn’t not do something after witnessing the all-male GOP contingent on the Senate Judiciary Committee defend an accused sexual abuser instead of simply nominating an equally conservative replacement. They couldn’t give Ford a hug, a pep talk, or the power to make Kavanaugh supporters care. All they could do was give her money.
        
          But if Ford ends up making a hefty profit once her expenses are covered, which it looks like she almost certainly will, that will be a major loss for the anti-rape organizations that could have bankrolled survivor support programs with those funds. Ford’s acceptance of the money also feeds into the time-honored canard that women lie about sex crimes to get money and fame. When Paula Jones accused then-President Bill Clinton of sexually harassing her during his tenure as governor of Arkansas, Clinton adviser James Carville quipped, “If you drag a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you’ll find.” (Weirdly, Sen. Lindsey Graham invoked that line during the Kavanaugh hearings to argue that Trump’s mockery of Ford wasn’t wholly unprecedented.)
        
          It was a lot harder to portray Ford as a low-class opportunist. In almost every way, she was the victim most likely to be believed: a white woman from a respectable, well-to-do family who attended elite private schools and traveled in the same elevated social circles as her alleged assailant. With her many degrees, prominent professional status, and position in the rarefied circles of Palo Alto, California, Ford had much to lose. Why, then, would she lie?
        
          Sperry has one theory. “Local records show that Christine Blasey Ford recently applied for a building permit to remodel their Santa Cruz beach house. The application was made on July 16—just two weeks before she sent her letter accusing Kavanaugh of assaulting her,” he writes. “The proposed remodeling job is significant and expensive.”
        
          It’s just as easy, though, to build a completely different theory using the exact same evidence. The fact that Ford’s personal financial decisions—her sale of a bed-and-breakfast, her decision to remodel her home—are now being picked apart only constitutes further proof that bringing a sexual assault claim subjects the accuser to intense scrutiny. Even if Ford becomes a folk hero on the left, her name will always be linked to sexual abuse and the man who allegedly assaulted her. And while Ford’s multimillion-dollar real estate assets may mean she doesn’t need $840,000 in donations to cover her security costs, they also mean she didn’t need to subject herself to national scrutiny, shame, and death threats to underwrite a home renovation.
        
          In his piece, Sperry worries that Ford’s GoFundMe take “sets a dangerous precedent by creating a new incentive for accusers” and encouraging “partisan activists” to “offer crowdfunding as a form of bounty on political foes, or to buy witness testimony against political adversaries.” This argument is unconvincing, because the barriers to reporting sexual abuse by powerful perpetrators are far mightier than the rewards. Making a practice of crowdfunding support for accusers could mitigate some of the power differentials that keep survivors silent when they’re not “model victims” like Ford. With the promise of help paying expenses, less wealthy survivors may be more likely to confront their assailants, knowing that whatever they lose—work clients, anonymity, employability in a certain region or industry—they will have some protection against falling into poverty, at least for a little while. Crowdfunding campaigns like the ones supporting Ford could also send a message to those inclined to harass survivors that death threats won’t be enough to intimidate accusers into silence. Rich people shouldn’t be the only ones who have the option of going public with sexual assault allegations of national import.
        
          No survivor of assault should have to pay to tell the truth, especially when that truth could protect others from harm or keep an unrepentant abuser out of a position of power. And Ford shouldn’t be financially penalized for her courage. But reparations or damages for victims are supposed to come from those who enacted or benefited from the harm done, not from sympathetic observers moved by an infuriating story.
        
          The question of whether Ford should profit from her testimony is an incredibly thorny one. Sperry, who has spent the past month smearing Ford as a deceitful political actor with poor character, is not well-equipped to answer it. In one of several pieces he’s written about Ford, Sperry claimed she “wasn’t exactly a choir girl” in high school and was known by “a sexually derogatory nickname … suggesting she was promiscuous.” He also wrote that, according to a source, in Ford’s high school yearbooks, girls boasted of “passing out from binge drinking” and “targeting boys” at Georgetown Prep for sexual encounters.
        
          Given what Sperry has written about Ford, I believe he would’ve found some reason to accuse her of profiteering even if the GoFundMe campaigns had never cropped up. Still, it would be a lot easier to defend Ford against Sperry’s claims if she were more transparent about where the money was going or if she publicly diverted the extra funds to some of the many organizations that support lower-income survivors. In a perfect world, all sexual assault survivors would get the money they need. In this one, those whose bravery and relative privilege elicit a disproportionate outpouring of financial support should spread their resources around.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/ivanka-trump-sarah-sanders-kellyanne-conway-trump-surrogates-women.html,"
          The women of the Trump administration have been keeping busy in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections. Donor-schmoozing events, rallies, Republican fundraisers—when a Trump-affiliated lady shows up to support a state politician or congressional candidate, an everyday campaign stop can become a big-ticket event. According to a Politico report, the National Republican Congressional Committee and candidates from around the country have been clamoring for appearances from three White House officials in particular: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, and Ivanka Trump.
        
          That the three most-requested campaign surrogates in the Trump administration are women should come as no surprise. With an alleged sexual abuser at its helm and its elevation of another alleged sexual abuser to the Supreme Court, the Republican Party isn’t doing so hot with women right now. Democrats were leading Republicans by 17 points in midsummer polls of suburban women; by late September, that gap had grown to 26 points. In that same timeframe, a 13-point lead for the GOP among white married women narrowed to 5 points. All subdemographics of women—even traditionally conservative ones, like white women without college degrees—are moving away from the party. Given those trend lines, it stands to reason that GOP officials want women to be the ones making the case for their candidates, to counteract the Republicans who are mocking alleged sexual-assault survivors as ugly, overly dramatic, and immoral.
        
          The Republican Party has a tendency to celebrate women and people of color as a kind of defensive maneuver. When Trump and his supporters applaud Kanye West or Diamond and Silk, they’re attempting to shield themselves from accusations of racism and trying to make their base appear more racially diverse than it is. And while Republicans don’t like electing women—a 2016 poll found that both women and men in the party prefer generic, unnamed male candidates to generic, unnamed female ones—they also don’t like being characterized as the He-Man Women Haters Club.
        
          But this year’s voracious appetite for female speakers isn’t about convincing independents and outsiders that the party isn’t hostile to women. It’s about Republicans convincing themselves that they aren’t bad people. Some Republicans thrill to the sound of Trump making fun of Christine Blasey Ford and comparing his female critics to animals. Others feel squeamish when they see their party mobilizing to discredit an alleged survivor of sexual violence. Not squeamish enough to turn against the president, his appointees, or the cast of craven grifters that surrounds him, mind you! But enough to have a hankering for the sound of a woman reassuring them that they are on the right side of history, doing the difficult work of preserving the America they know and love.
        
          Conway, for her part, has always been adept at reassuring right-wing partisans that her boss loves women. “I work for President Trump because he’s so good to the women who work for him,” she said in a recent interview on CNN. In that same TV spot, on CNN’s State of the Union, she publicly identified herself as a victim of sexual assault for the first time, just three days after Ford and Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a breathtaking bit of verbal maneuvering, Conway attempted to use her own victimhood for political ends to discredit what she decried as politically motivated accusations against Kavanaugh. “We do treat people differently who are either the victims or perpetrators of this based on their politics now or based on their gender now. That is a huge mistake,” she said. The message to Republicans: Any attack on a member of the GOP is inherently a partisan one, and one that can and should be ignored.
        
          Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Sanders draws crowds who love the way she bamboozles reporters with doublespeak, foiling their efforts to make the administration answer for its actions. For Trump, she defends the erosion of democratic norms; for Trump supporters, she offers talking points by which they can do the same. Recently, Sanders has been reassuring Republicans that, in an era marked by women’s marches and an unprecedented wave of women (that is, Democratic women) running for political office, it’s OK to have traditional views on gender. “Most of you probably know me from my day job,” she told her audience at an event for Gov. Kim Reynolds in Iowa, but “the most important job that I have, and certainly the most important title I have no matter what I do, is that of a mom.”
        
          It’s no coincidence that Sanders sounded like another one of the GOP’s favorite female surrogates: “The most important job any woman can have is being a mother,” Ivanka Trump once said in a campaign ad for her father. Here, Sanders and Ivanka are helping Republicans who think women belong at home breathe easy after a long day of hyperventilating when they hear California is requiring corporations to have women on their boards or see someone wearing a “The Future Is Female” shirt at the supermarket. In the safe space of the Republican Party, women not only know their place—they’ll tell you it’s OK to put them there.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/why-the-democrats-need-to-pack-the-courts.html,"
          It’s easy to get incensed about how Republicans are remaking the judiciary, but it tends to happen in waves. Three weeks ago, Democrats were beside themselves that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court without a meaningful investigation of sexual assault claims against him. Last week, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to confirm federal court nominees while the Senate itself was in recess. Democrats, who thought they had struck a deal with Republicans to put this process on hold until after the midterms, were not present to vote on nominees such as Allison Jones Rushing, who was evaluated for a lifetime appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. She is 36 years old and has never been a judge. And this week, Democrats are bracing for unprecedented vote suppression in the upcoming midterms, something that has been enabled by Supreme Court rulings in voter fraud and race discrimination cases.
        
          The answer to any question about why Republicans are pushing judges through to lifetime office without scrutiny is a simple “because we can.” What Democrats can do about it is more complex. “Vote,” seems to be the main answer, even as the franchise has been limited by the Supreme Court in just the last term. But in recent weeks there has been a surge of serious legal scholars proposing real reforms to the courts. Sober constitutional thinkers are urging Democrats to find the resolve to pack the courts (here and here) push for term limits (here and here) and to just generally begin to burn all the norms and conventions around the courts to the ground. (here and here). These proposals seem to find traction for a moment, but by and large Democrats are inclined toward stunning conservatism around the Supreme Court, with a good amount of possibly misplaced reverence for the court’s perceived role as a counter-majoritarian check in fraught times.
        
          Last week, however, a project seeking to recapture the federal judiciary was launched with an eye toward keeping this issue at the front and center of progressive politics. The project, named 1.20.21, launched last Wednesday, and among other goals, it seeks to expand the U.S. Supreme Court by four justices in 2021, and add dozens of seats to the lower federal courts in the coming years.
        
          The effort is run by Aaron Belkin, a political scientist from San Francisco State University, who has spent the last two decades tracking and influencing public opinion around “don’t ask don’t tell” and the ban on transgender service members. He is joined by Sean McElwee, the digital activist who created the #AbolishICE hashtag. Harvard Law School’s Mark Tushnet chairs the campaign’s advisory board and Harvard’s Laurence Tribe also serves on their board. All of this makes me think it actually has a chance of succeeding. So, I spoke with Belkin via email about polling, public opinion and reforming the Supreme Court. (Full disclosure: Belkin and I did debate together in college.) A lightly edited version of our conversation is below.
        
          Dahlia Lithwick: The only thing most Americans know about court-packing is that it almost tanked FDR’s presidency. In fact, even tentative conservative efforts to pack the federal courts were condemned across party lines just last year. Isn’t even the idea of court packing the universally acknowledged third rail of judicial politics?
        
          Aaron Belkin: I’ll answer your question in the context of your reference to “Democrats … proposing … to just generally begin to burn all the norms and conventions around the courts to the ground.” It is not possible to begin to burn those norms and conventions because the Republicans have already burned much of the judicial house down.
        
          During President Obama’s first term, the GOP arguably blocked more lower court appointments than were blocked in U.S. history. Then they stole a Supreme Court seat. Then multiple ostensibly moderate GOP leaders like the late Sen. McCain said that if Hillary Clinton were elected, they would fix the number of Supreme Court justices at eight throughout her term. Then they leveraged procedural abuses to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. And, of course, there’s a much broader field of norms of governance that the GOP has shredded and that are not directly related to the courts. So it’s important to contextualize proposals to expand the court within the normative destruction that has already taken place.
        
          As you observe, court expansion was a third-rail topic as long as both parties behaved relatively fairly and honorably in the nomination and confirmation process. At this point, however, the sedimented weight of GOP judicial misconduct has prompted a range of progressive thought leaders, including Congressman Ro Khanna, to endorse court expansion in recent weeks.
        
          So, on the one hand I agree with you that there hasn’t been much of a national conversation about expansion (and that’s why our new project is needed—to amplify the conversation).On the other hand, the discussion has taken off quickly; there is widespread recognition that democracy cannot function when one of the major political parties steals courts; and there is growing recognition that Democrats can and must do something about it.
        
          One final point is that the lessons of FDR’s efforts may not be as straightforward as often assumed, as important differences distinguish then and now. In particular, FDR was reacting to terrible jurisprudence, not judicial theft.
        
          Dahlia Lithwick: Conservative voters prioritize the courts. Progressive voters do not. This is one of those other seemingly universally acknowledged truths you are trying to overcome. I have a lot of theories for this, but I’d love to hear yours. Why do progressives tend to be so unwilling to rank the courts as a top voting priority?
        
          Aaron Belkin: Polling data show that Democratic politicians tend to talk about the court in positive terms, often emphasizing Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, and more recent gay rights jurisprudence culminating in Windsor and Obergefell. Republican politicians, by contrast, whip up their base by constantly pointing to decisions conservatives detest. So in this case, voters’ attitudes and priorities may reflect opinion leadership.
        
          But that begs the question as to why Republican politicians implicate the courts in their strategies for enraging their base. I would argue that this is a story about the power of capital. The greed wing of the Republican party (donors like the Koch brothers and politicians like Paul Ryan) can’t attract voters by promising deregulation and tax cuts for the rich. So, the greed wing uses scapegoating to manufacture paranoia, which is effective at driving GOP turnout. The targets shift around, with some elections emphasizing immigrant gang members, others transgender people in the bathroom, others uppity women, plus the constant through-line of black crime. Even though the emphasis of scapegoating shifts, the recipe is always the same: The greed wing of the party incites paranoia to attract voters.
        
          It turns out that controlling the courts while also demonizing them is an important part of this strategy. Control of the courts delivers jurisprudence like Citizens United that promotes the interests of capital, in other words, corporations and elites. And demonizing the courts when they afford even minimal protections to minorities is helpful for stoking paranoia. Consider, for example, the use of Grutter v. Bollinger to incite rage about affirmative action.
        
          So, capital (eg the Koch Brothers) has a strong incentive to create and invest in NGOs like the Federalist Society to secure control over the judiciary and bullhorns like Fox News to talk about the courts in ways that inflame paranoia.
        
          Dahlia Lithwick: The paradox here of course is that you want to use public polling data and activism to foster energy and enthusiasm about the most staid and predictable (and still popular!) branch of government. Even the liberal justices have rallied around Brett Kavanaugh and the institution itself in recent days, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor urging that the high court is going “to let these times pass.” What do you do when you look to be trying to demystify and in fact politicize the one branch of government that needs to stay mystified and apolitical in order to maintain public legitimacy?
        
          Aaron Belkin: Public policy should be based on fact rather than myth, and in this case, there are two truths that should play a more prominent role in national conversations: (1) Republicans stole the courts, and (2) the courts have spent more than a generation promoting the interests of corporations and elites at the expense of people of color, women and workers. (It may also be worth mentioning that in some cases, the court has relied on radical and unpersuasive reasoning such as the notion in Shelby that the Voting Rights Act isn’t needed because it has worked.)
        
          If the court wants to shore up its own legitimacy, it has the capacity to do that. If Republicans want to shore up the court’s legitimacy, they can acknowledge their thefts and endorse policies such as court expansion that nullify those thefts. Democrats can’t be held (or hold themselves) unilaterally responsible for maintaining the integrity of the judiciary, while Republicans and the court itself undermine integrity.
        
          Dahlia Lithwick: How do you propose to break through the relentless media fog of drama and distraction to keep public interest sustained on the courts? Do you have any reason to believe that the outrage around the Kavanaugh hearings can last into the midterms and on into the 2020 election?
        
          Aaron Belkin: I think you’re asking about two related but partially distinct phenomena, both of which I’ll address below. In terms of public interest, I don’t think the issue is whether discontent about the Kavanaugh hearings can be sustained. Rather, I think the issue is that the progressive base understands that (1) Republicans stole the Supreme Court; (2) judicial theft is embedded in a range of anti-democratic practices such as voter suppression, extreme gerrymandering, dark money in politics, and lying; (3) the cumulative effect of relentless cheating is that the GOP has rigged the system; (4) one result of relentless cheating is that government is unable to solve pressing problems like health care; and (5) democracy is seriously at risk.
        
          Our job at the 1/20/21 Project is to try to make sure that during the political campaigns that will span most of the next two years, conversations about the five points above include consideration of what to do about the courts. As well, we need to remind the public that aside from a few rulings such as Obergefell, the Supreme Court has spent more than a generation injuring people of color, women and workers. It is certainly true that candidates tend to prefer discussions of kitchen table issues like health care over procedural conversations about how to fix democracy. But I think there is sufficient concern about the precariousness of our democracy that there will be room for discussion of the courts during the forthcoming campaigns.
        
          As for the question about media strategies, my colleagues and I spent the past 20 years learning how to use state-of-the-art research to help ensure that policy conversations are based on evidence, not emotion, and our team played a role in informing public opinion during two long-term national debates (concerning “don’t ask, don’t tell” and then transgender military service.) So, we’ll apply the lessons we learned during these two debates to the conversation about the courts. Here are a few examples of research and research translation that we are planning:
        
          There are three more important points to make about these strategies. First, I was very proud during our work on “don’t ask, don’t tell” and transgender military service that people who opposed inclusive policy used our research to support their arguments. The reason is that we published all of our findings, not just those findings that supported one political perspective. We’ll take the same approach to research about the courts.
        
          Second, much of the research and research translation mentioned above has already been done, so you could ask, “why do you need an organization to ask research questions that have already been asked?” The answer is that there’s a big difference between a few scholars knowing something and everyone else knowing it. When we started our work on “don’t ask, don’t tell,” even the military’s own scholars had already published studies showing that gays and lesbians don’t undermine the military. It still took a decade of additional research to drive that point home in the court of public opinion.
        
          Finally, the list of research and research translation activities illustrates why you can’t just rely on thought leaders to publish op-eds if you want to inform a national conversation. You need organizations to amplify the conversation systematically and persistently. That’s the rationale for our new project.
        
          Dahlia Lithwick: Talk about some of the other reforms out in the ether. Term limits, restoring the filibuster, limiting the jurisdiction of the federal courts? Can’t they achieve what you seek to do but in a less disruptive way?
        
          Aaron Belkin: Democracy cannot work when a major political party steals courts, and that’s just what Republicans have done. The Republicans stole the courts and Democrats must “un-steal” them. Yes, a robust national conversation about various reform options is needed. And yes, there is a strong case to be made for some of the options. But un-stealing the courts is the only viable path to nullifying and penalizing Republican misconduct. Expansion, in other words, is the only option that imposes a proportionate political penalty for theft.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/trump-lies-kavanaugh-khashoggi.html,"
          President Donald Trump has been bending and breaking laws all of his life. Michael Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, stated under oath that Trump directed him to violate federal campaign finance law; the state of New York has evidence that Trump and his family have been cheating on their taxes for years; the Trump family’s “persistently illegal conduct” and “repeated and willful self-dealing transactions” have led the New York attorney general to file a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation. The list goes on.
        
          Trump is open about his disdain for law. In April, he told an audience in Michigan that “our laws are so corrupt and stupid.”
        
          Trump is also clear about why he is breaking these laws. The entire point of Trump’s campaign to “Make America Great Again” is to lead us back to a time before the civil rights movement, before laws against insider trading, before the New Deal and federal agencies that regulate the commerce of plutocrats. This was an era of white male supremacy. The rich paid no income taxes and there was no minimum wage, so the wealthy lived like royalty. His thinking is akin to the way past activists viewed sit-down strikes. Like these past civil dissenters, Trump views himself as breaking the laws that he doesn’t believe should exist, which includes most of the laws and regulations put in place since the 1930s.
        
          Indeed, instead of preparing a traditional legal defense, Trump is confounding legal observers by doing things that, by all objective standards, should make matters worse. He obstructs justice openly. In fact, in vowing to “fight back” against the Mueller investigation, he announced his intention to continue obstructing the probe. He also continually changes his story. First, he denies everything (“I have nothing to do with Russia”), then he says there would be nothing wrong if he had accepted help from Russia.
        
          Obviously, a person who keeps changing his story is not a credible witness. Moreover, you can’t devise a legal defense while you are committing crimes, and Trump’s continuing efforts to obstruct justice suggest ongoing criminal behavior.
        
          It’s easy to conclude that Trump has lost his mind and his lawyers are asleep at the switch. In fact, there’s a method to what appears to be Trump’s madness: The president intends to beat Mueller and his would-be interlocutors in Congress by torpedoing factuality and the rule of law itself.
        
          Robert O. Paxton, in his classic work The Anatomy of Fascism, defines a cult of leadership as one in which the followers believe the leader’s instincts are better than the logic used by elites. The followers are willing to give up their individuality and freedom in exchange for the leader’s “protection.” And what is Trump protecting his followers from? Scholars Karen Stenner and Jonathan Haidt offer an explanation. In their essay “Authoritarianism Is Not a Momentary Madness but an Eternal Dynamic Within Liberal Democracies,” Stenner and Haidt describe the psychology behind the fervor of the embrace of authoritarians. A certain percentage of the population has “bias against different others” including racial and other minority out-groups. The authoritarian leader stokes their fears, creating a normative threat. These people then turn to the leader as something of a savior. The leader embraces the mythic destiny of the nation. He doesn’t follow laws. He is the law.
        
          When Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump’s lies by arguing that his false statements actually point to something true, she offered an explanation for why Trump supporters embrace transparent lies. “President Obama was born in Africa,” for example, is a provable lie, but it points toward what to Trump’s supporters see as a deeper truth: President Obama is black, and therefore, isn’t really a real American.
        
          Sanders’ argument is psychologically sound. Scholars Oliver Hahl, Minjae Kim, and Ezra W. Zickerman Sivan, in “The Authentic Appeal of the Lying Demagogue,” explain that those who want to destroy the “political establishment” willingly embrace a liar because they understand that the lies themselves serve a destructive purpose. The people who want to destroy the political establishment today are those who are threatened by growing diversity. Trump’s lies work toward that end.
        
          In a totalitarian regime, state-controlled media normalizes the leader’s constantly changing stories, which serves to further obliterate any notion of a shared truth. Trump’s favorite news outlets similarly normalize his changing stories, thereby undermining factuality. When people can no longer sort out what is factual and what was invented, they conclude that the truth is unknowable. It’s the ultimate in relativism and skepticism. Without facts and a shared reality, jury verdicts have no meaning, and the results of law enforcement investigations are easily manipulated or even dismissed.
        
          Look at what happened when Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Supreme Court was nearly derailed by credible accusations of sexual assault. While the confirmation was in doubt, Trump protested that Kavanaugh was “innocent until proven guilty.” He then ordered an extremely limited investigation of the charges that interviewed a small number of witnesses and didn’t even speak with the accuser or the alleged culprit. Ultimately, he falsely declared that Kavanaugh had been “proven innocent” by the whole charade. This false fact—Kavanaugh was exonerated—now becomes reality to all of his followers.
        
          The same exact dynamic is playing out with the apparent murder by Saudi Arabia of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump has applied the “innocent until proven guilty” notion to the Saudi state, even directly comparing the case to Kavanaugh’s. Despite the reported audio evidence of Khashoggi’s brutal dismemberment at the hands of Saudi officials, physical evidence of an attempted cover-up, and the plain fact that Khashoggi entered a Saudi Consulate never to be seen again, Trump is treating the case as a stone-cold whodunit. Don’t be surprised when, in spite of all this evidence, whatever cover story is eventually manufactured for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, or any other probable culprits, is ultimately accepted as fact by Trump and then by his followers. Once again, the lie will then become the fact.
        
          Steve Bannon explained a broader administration strategy for dispensing with facts. “The real opposition is the media,” he has said. “And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” Yale professor Timothy Snyder, in his groundbreaking book The Road to Unfreedom, explains in detail how leaders like Vladimir Putin and Trump undermine factuality by flooding the zone in this way. Putin dominates Russia by propagating grand lies that take the entire society off balance. For example, when Ukrainians protested against Putin’s puppet ruler, Viktor Yanukovych, Putin’s press reported that the protesters were organized by an LGBTQ group attempting a “homodictatorship.” Enough people believe the lie—or pretend to believe the lie—that a shared reality becomes impossible.
        
          Part of Trump’s defense against his various investigatory pursuers is to persuade his followers that all politicians are corrupt liars, which is one reason the “Lock her up” chant has been so devastating. If people believe all politicians are corrupt, going after Trump becomes political persecution, or a “witch hunt.”
        
          Trump’s final aim isn’t simply to escape accountability for his crimes. The final aim is to replace democracy itself with a form of autocracy, under which he and his cronies are forever unaccountable for criminal actions. Normalizing lies and flooding the zone shatters the public sphere upon which democracy depends. Without that shared reality, Mueller poses no threat to Trump. Similarly, without a shared public sphere, Trump doesn’t have to worry about resistance. As Yale professor Jason Stanley says, without truth it is impossible to speak truth to power, so there is only power.
        
          The United States is on a steep learning curve. Because truth, factuality, and our very public sphere are under attack, our democracy (and republic) is in danger. The attack is devastatingly effective, partly because we have never experienced anything like this and thus are largely unprepared. Our task now is to save our public sphere. The way to do this was demonstrated by how the Chileans got out of the far more extreme Pinochet regime and reinstated democracy: All sides opposed to authoritarianism and committed to democracy worked together. That means they started actually talking, and listening, to one another. In the United States, this would mean that all groups that claim to be committed to continuing our democratic republic, from supporters of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Never Trump Republicans, would need to join forces. We will likely soon find out if the nation is up to the task.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/abortion-roe-overturned-christine-blasey-ford-believe-women.html,"
          You could be forgiven if you missed the pivot. For a few days after her testimony, Donald Trump and Senate Republicans feigned regard for Christine Blasey Ford’s veracity and pain. Then, in the blink of an eye, she was reduced to a liar and hoax-adjacent scammer, so they could seat their guy on the bench.
        
          As Josh Marshall pointed out last week, the political manipulation of Ford’s story—the slow slide from “we believe her” to “we believe her, but she’s wrong about the identity of her attacker” happened without an explicit turn. For a scant few days, Republicans were careful not to call her a liar or an operative. After her testimony, the president himself deemed her “credible.”  And then, ironically enough, Susan Collins became the first Republican to say out loud what Ed Whelan had tried to claim two weeks earlier: Ford was indeed attacked, but she was also confused about the date and the identity of her assailant, no matter that when asked about this under oath, she testified to being 100 percent certain that it was Brett Kavanaugh. By Monday of last week, at the swearing-in-slash-pep-rally for Kavanaugh at the White House, President Donald Trump triumphantly made the leap from “she doesn’t remember” to “it was a hoax … it was all made up, it was fabricated, and it’s a disgrace.” That’s all it took. Pretend to believe her to her face, condemn her as a liar and a fabricator once she has stepped away (also, claim repeatedly that she had no corroboration while refusing to look for or consider any corroboration). And to finish the circuit, of course, by Sunday, the president reminded us all that the truth of Ford’s narrative was immaterial anyway because “we won.”
        
          By initially avoiding the ugliness of “she lies” and only fully embracing it days later, the GOP effectively vaulted the whole claim into the well-known fuzziness of “well, women are unreliable narrators of their own lives, so really, how can you believe them?” If you stop and consider that these same Republicans stand poised to limit women’s future access to basic contraceptive care and abortion, it’s clear that this is a chilling theme that transcends sexual harassment or assault or #MeToo. The party for whom the Trumpian coda to the Kavanaugh scandal seems to be “she was credible, and we still don’t care,” now controls the Supreme Court, constitutes one-sixth of the federal bench, and populates the legislatures that will determine the consequences for women’s health.
        
          As we process the events of last week, please understand that this moment in law and gender is not really about Ford and Kavanaugh anymore. It is about resurfacing a very, very old story about women and their agency and their truth: Women’s experiences, memories, and suffering don’t matter; their control over the truth of what they themselves have lived through is determined by those who win. And if you remember those tropes from the Bible or from Shakespeare, well, yes, so do I.
        
          In just two short weeks, reviving that narrative required just three deft moves, distinct acts, if you will: She’s credible, she’s confused, she lied. This distortion of Ford’s memory has in turn opened the door to a new story—that all women lie about sexual assault, that men are not safe and that women as a class are untrustworthy and manipulative, that their sole power lies in their ability to lie about sex and that they will forever use that power to trap men, to extort men, and to manipulate men. The first lady cautions that women who want to speak up ought to amass bulletproof evidence of their future sexual assaults—neither their word nor contemporaneous reporting will bolster their claims after all.
        
          I mention this only because the backlash isn’t limited to Ford (though the backlash against her is severe and disturbing—she cannot return to her home because death threats have made it impossible). There has been ample reporting about the chilling effect her hearing will have on women reporting sexual assault, particularly if the takeaway is that women need to have a processed rape kit, a police escort, and video footage in order to be believed about assault. But testimony is evidence, indeed it’s often the only evidence, even though it’s very easy to say that the testimony alone should not be credible, particularly when investigators are precluded from collecting any other evidence. What we’ve witnessed is the disturbing assertion that testimony is actually meaningless.
        
          But what has happened in the debate on women’s credibility has implications not merely in terms of women reporting sexual assault or harassment in the future. It also will harm women’s access to reproductive rights. Don’t believe me? Consider this: Laws seeking to limit women’s access to abortion borrow heavily from the two stories Republicans have told about Ford: that women are confused about what has happened to them and also easily misled by cunning grifters. Anti-abortion measures that have popped up in recent decades include targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP, laws that force women to listen to (false) health warnings from their physicians, mandatory waiting periods in which they can be persuaded to change their minds, parental and spousal consent requirements, and mandatory ultrasound requirements. State efforts to dredge up clinic records to determine whether women have been pressured into terminating their pregnancies are similarly animated by the idea that women are uniquely subject to illicit control and manipulation. Iowa was pushing legislation that demanded that women seeking abortions as a result of a rape had to report that rape within 45 days. What possible reason could there be for such laws? Because women are untruthful and easily manipulated. So many of these anti-abortion moves date back to 11 years ago, when Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the fifth vote to end so-called partial-birth abortions, as a consequence of the pressing need to protect “women [who] come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained.” If you start from the assumption that women don’t know their own stories, cannot be trusted to be truthful, and are easily led astray, regulation of their bodies and their choices becomes exponentially easier. The dismissal of Ford sets the table for more of the same treatment.
        
          Whatever your own views may be of the veracity of Ford’s claims, seen through the lens of creeping abortion restrictions predicated on the idea that women are untrustworthy, the conclusion is inescapable: The new message that women regularly lie about men and sex, that they do so at the behest of powerful men, and that men are in danger as a consequence will have more and more salience in the conversation that is to come on women’s health and reproductive freedom. The party that now insists that women cannot be trusted to understand or explain their own sexual histories will gleefully become the party that assumes that women seeking medical treatment and the termination of their pregnancies are also unreliable narrators at best and liars at worst.
        
          Ford’s testimony was slotted into the #MeToo conversation in part because she took part in this new movement that involves standing up to powerful men with complaints that date back years. This spring, writing about the Iowa effort to force women to report their rapes to the police in a timely fashion if they wanted to terminate the resulting pregnancy, Jessica Valenti presciently observed that “[t]he Iowa bill’s exception rules operate from much the same place that all anti-choice legislation does: that women are not to be trusted. That we lie about rape and that we can’t make decisions about our own bodies without interference from male politicians. It’s an especially interesting position to take in a moment when women across the country are demanding that their stories of sexual abuse be believed and taken seriously.”
        
          Ford’s testimony and the resultant GOP claim that we believe her but we don’t care, or alternatively, that we don’t believe her and don’t care, have put Valenti’s hypothesis to the test. If the past few weeks (and really, years) are any indication, stories of sexual abuse may fall on deaf ears in the near term. And you can be sure that has set the stage for future efforts to circumscribe women’s choices by casting doubt on the reliability of their narratives in other contexts as well. This will certainly affect how female witnesses are treated in criminal or civil matters. But it will also make it ever easier to regulate their bodies and their decisions in ways we have not yet begun to contemplate.

          This piece is part of the Radical issue, a special package from Outward, Slate’s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture. Read more here. 
        
          In the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings, a dyke friend in her twenties posted that, real talk, she doesn’t like men. I hit the like button super fast, feeling secretive and sort of guilty about it. She’d come through the same radical queer and trans circles I came up in, and in that click, I felt relieved to acknowledge an obvious truth: Most men treat women like something less than human, whether accidentally or on purpose, and that means it’s hard to like them.
        
          I’d recently been scanning the men coming into my workplace, wondering about their histories of sexual assault. Is he a rapist? What about him? Where does he fall on the creep scale? It was an old impulse that had returned in force as the nation debated just how many of their husbands, brothers, and sons were perpetrators, given that one in three American women experience sexual violence in their lifetimes. Republicans insisted that men were the ones who should be afraid, while women recounted the everyday, harrowing ways we reroute our lives to avoid assault. My “woke” male co-workers made #MeToo jokes, as if the whole thing were a funny spectacle. It was enough to make me want to stop talking to men entirely.
        
          Yet still, inside my head, the #NotAllMen chorus roared. What about the dad of two who likes all my angry tweets? Or the guy who showed up at the hospital with too much food when my spouse was in labor? Or my friends who are trans men?
        
          Patriarchy runs so deep that I defend hypothetical men’s feelings right away, even to myself. I am a married lesbian, as far away from needing male approval as a woman can get, and I still feel it, the slow poisonous drip of cultural conditioning that tells me to prioritize men. My imagination, that thing that could break us out of American fascism, is trapped in an old feminist loop, because I’ve been trained that the worst thing I can be is a man-hating dyke. But it’s time to confront the latent homophobia in that insult and our fear that anger makes us seem too gay. Because anger, not fear, is precisely the emotion that’s needed these days.
        
          Of course, certain women’s anger had become trendy under Trump: that of straight cis white women, the good girls of the left taking on the big bad president. Rebecca Traister, promoting her new book, Good and Mad, joked on at least two podcasts that writing about rage made her sex life better, reminding the world—perhaps unconsciously—that women’s anger needs a heterosexual qualifier.
        
          When straight cis white women talk about anger, it’s sexy resistance fuel. When straight cis black women get angry, they get caricatured and punished. When cis lesbians talk about anger, we get Rosie O’Donnell’d, used as a shield for misogyny, since men know other women won’t defend us. “Man-hating dyke” is a classic insult, whether aimed at actual lesbians or Hillary Clinton, used to remind queer women that there’s something wrong with us. Second-wave straight feminists did whatever they could to distance themselves from lesbians, avoiding the “lavender menace” and adopting pretty, gender-conforming icons like Gloria Steinem. Straight or queer, angry or not, trans women’s mere existence is considered a threat.
        
          Perhaps that’s why the dykes I know have been crying in bathrooms and going to bed early, more riddled with anxiety than boiling over with righteous indignation. For a lot of us, the reminder that none of us is safe is an old feeling. We are tired and despairing, not newly enraged and energized.
        
          Part of that is because dykes have always held cultural space for women’s anger, absorbing and reflecting the frustration with men that straight women can’t express. We are the friend you call when you’re sexually assaulted, the one who drags you to a protest (or who starts the whole movement). Cis and trans lesbians are in a unique position to see misogyny from the outside, because our dates generally understand that women are fully human. We just haven’t always been explicit about the domestic misogyny we see from a distance or how we feel about it, because homophobia and transphobia make it dangerous to be an angry dyke. Dyke anger is the difference between gay assimilation and queer radicalism, and we are punished for it socially: Why do you have to be such a killjoy? Can’t you leave your politics at home?
        
          Practically speaking, we still have male bosses and landlords and clients and mayors and editors (hi!) who wield power in our actual lives, even if we don’t come home to a man on the couch every night, and it’s hard to publicly state our resentment, lest some of them use that power against us. But what that means is that “man-hater” remains an insult we’re afraid of. We’ve reclaimed “witch” and “queer” and “dyke,” but we can’t seem to own this last, worst stereotype of ourselves. Frankly, men do not deserve this much mental sympathy, and the few who do already know it. But even as men kill women who question them daily, those of us with the least amount of investment in patriarchy are afraid to say what we really think of them.
        
          In a quick poll, my dyke friends had good reasons to eschew the “man-hater” label: They like plenty of men; they don’t want to “hate” anyone; and no one wants to be associated with trans-exclusionary radical feminists, or TERFs. Plus, many lesbians are proudly gender-fluid or butch, and it feels icky to reject masculinity wholesale when it feels like something that’s a part of you.
        
          But it’s time to get the misogyny out of our own heads, because if we don’t, we cede a powerful space for women’s anger to those who want to control us. We can be angry dykes if we want to, even if all that means is owning that term for ourselves.
        
          To be clear, I do not mean we should create physical lesbian separatist spaces. There is too much painful, transphobic history in that idea to even entertain it. I watched some women online muse about moving to communes—“Do those still exist?”—to avoid the constant negotiation of public space with men. I assumed they were straight and cis, because otherwise they would have known about TERFy women’s lands or at least about the drama of Michfest. We dykes have already torn ourselves apart over trans identity and how to separate men from women. There is only one right side, and communes that ban anyone based on their genitalia are not on it.
        
          What I mean instead is reclaiming a phrase that lets us divest from patriarchy in a more serious way. Men have to learn what it feels like when we stop protecting them, and we have to stop seeking male approval. We have to name who’s perpetrating violence against cis and trans women in this country: It’s white men, with the white women who are invested in patriarchy along for the ride. We need to quiet the last of those self-censoring voices. Reimagining something bigger than resistance, in Michelle Alexander’s terms, requires us to get beyond that fear of male approval. Once we do, we can be a source of massive, radical power, and straight women would do well to follow our lead.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/clarence-thomas-neil-gorsuch-masterpiece-cakeshop-telescope-media-group.html,"
          Do businesses have a First Amendment right to discriminate against same-sex couples? The Supreme Court was supposed to answer this question last term in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. But Justice Anthony Kennedy lost his nerve and crafted a compromise ruling that ducked the main issue. He then quit the bench, leaving LGBTQ rights in the hands of his successor, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as well as the cadre of reactionary judges whom President Donald Trump appointed to the lower courts.
        
          On Tuesday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in Telescope Media Group v. Lindsey, a follow-up to Masterpiece Cakeshop. The 8th Circuit, which recently received an infusion of Trump appointees, looks poised to use Telescope to hobble civil rights laws. It will also tee up a potential Supreme Court showdown that will allow Kavanaugh to do what Kennedy wouldn’t and deny same-sex couples equal access to the marketplace. If the court does take that drastic step, then the impact won’t be limited to gay rights: Decades of precedent protecting Americans—including racial minorities—from discrimination could be in grave peril.
        
          The first thing you need to know about Telescope is that it isn’t a real case. Unlike in Masterpiece Cakeshop—where a baker turned away a gay couple, then insisted upon his right to do so—nobody has suffered any injury here. Telescope Media Group is a media production company in Minnesota that films ads and live events for profit. Its owners, a married couple named Angel and Carl Larsen, view their work through the lens of their Christian faith. (Motto: “We want to magnify Christ like a telescope.”) But the company does not currently shoot wedding videos, so it has never had an opportunity to reject a same-sex couple, and it has not been fined by the state for its anti-gay stance.
        
          Instead, it was Telescope that sued Minnesota, demanding an exemption from the state’s Human Rights Act. The act is a standard nondiscrimination law that prohibits commercial businesses from discriminating against customers on the basis of several traits, including sexual orientation. Telescope is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, an evangelical law firm that specializes in anti-LGBTQ impact litigation. The purpose of this case is not to protect Angel and Carl Larsen from some gay trolls seeking to shut down Telescope because of its owners’ beliefs. Rather, it’s part of ADF’s long-term strategy to enshrine discrimination in the law by securing special rights for Christian business owners to refuse service to LGBTQ people.
        
          Jeremy Tedesco, the ADF attorney who argued Telescope on Tuesday, got around the hypothetical nature of the case by claiming that the Larsens want to “immediately enter the industry.” They are afraid to do so, he explained, for fear of sanctions under Minnesota’s Human Rights Act; they fear that if they reject a gay couple, they will be put out of business. Tedesco insisted that the Larsens have a free speech right to refuse to film same-sex weddings because they wish to “tell stories about marriage.” By forcing them to serve gay customers, Minnesota is regulating “the creation of films,” which constitutes compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.
        
          Tedesco found a mostly receptive audience. He faced Judges Bobby Shepherd, Jane Kelly, and David Ryan Stras. Shepherd is a hard-line conservative who recently defied the Supreme Court’s decision prohibiting draconian restrictions on abortion clinics. Kelly is a moderate liberal and the only Obama appointee to the 8th Circuit. (Thank blue slips for that.) Stras is a Trump appointee whose nomination drew fierce opposition from civil rights organizations. Before Tedesco even opened his mouth, he seemed likely to land a 2–1 decision in his favor.
        
          Stras and Shepherd did nothing to suggest otherwise throughout the course of arguments. Kelly peppered Tedesco with tough questions, reminding him that same-sex couples “have the liberty right to marry.” Doesn’t the state have a strong interest in protecting their ability to exercise that right? But Tedesco told Kelly that she had it backwards—it’s Angel and Carl Larsen’s right that needs safeguarding. “The state doesn’t tolerate or respect the beliefs of people like Carl and Angel,” Tedesco said, when it forces them “to express an idea about marriage that they disagree with.”
        
          Alethea Huyser, Minnesota’s assistant solicitor general, tried to reframe the case as a straightforward application of settled principles. “Minnesota’s law regulates discrimination based on protected status,” she told the court. “It does not regulate message.” Moreover, it doesn’t target any particular kind of speech; in the parlance of Supreme Court doctrine, it’s “content-neutral.” The Human Rights Act isn’t designed to compel pro-gay speech or anti-Christian speech or any speech at all. It merely prohibits businesses from turning away certain customers on the basis of a protected trait.
        
          Stras vigorously disagreed. “In my view, to the extent [the law] touches speech, it prohibits only discriminatory speech. That’s not content-neutral,” he told Huyser. This theory is astonishing. The Supreme Court has long recognized that nondiscrimination laws do not generally implicate the First Amendment because they regulate conduct, not speech. And when the laws do regulate speech, they impose only an “incidental burden” on expression that does not trigger strict scrutiny. As the Supreme Court has explained, a law that bars an employer from hanging a sign that states “White Applicants Only” technically regulates speech. But its purpose is to regulate conduct, and so it should not be subject to stringent First Amendment review.
        
          It seems that Stras disagrees. After all, a law that bars “White Applicants Only” signs prohibits only discriminatory speech, just like Minnesota’s Human Rights Act. Does that mean every nondiscrimination law, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is not content-neutral and must therefore pass strict scrutiny? That would require each law to be “narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.” So the question would then be: Does preventing discrimination in the marketplace qualify as a compelling interest, and if so, can laws that preclude such bigoted speech be sufficiently tailored to survive First Amendment scrutiny?
        
          Not to Stras. If the court finds that videography is compelled speech, he asked Huyser, “doesn’t the state necessarily lose, because they have no interest in compelling somebody to speak?”
        
          This statement has stunning implications. A huge number of activities, from videography and photography to baking, card design, and virtually all wedding services, compel some form of speech. And civil rights measures always compel expression; managers, for instance, must train their employees not to discriminate, promoting the state’s message of equality in commerce. Under Stras’ theory, any law that directs businesses to serve customers equally—and do so in a manner that involves speech—would be unconstitutional. The entire legal framework that supports civil rights laws would come toppling down.
        
          Stras didn’t pull this idea out of a hat. He got it from Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, who seized upon Masterpiece Cakeshop to promote a radical reconception of the First Amendment. In a concurrence joined by Gorsuch, Thomas wrote that a vast range of nondiscrimination laws should be held unconstitutional because they compel businesses to “communicate” a message. Thomas and Gorsuch couldn’t get a majority back then—but with Kennedy gone, they may have more luck using the First Amendment to sabotage nondiscrimination measures. Stras is teeing Telescope up for the justices, even though the plaintiffs in this case have nothing at stake. And next time around, with Kavanaugh on the court, they may have five votes to abolish civil rights laws as we know them.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-mistaken-identity.html,"
          In late September, Christine Blasey Ford testified under oath that she was “100 percent” sure that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982. Later that day, Kavanaugh responded by swearing with equal certainty that he did not. How do we square these two contradictory statements? A case of mistaken identity provides a neat resolution: It allows us to believe them both. Ford is sincere and wrong, her memory warped by trauma and the passage of time. Yes, someone did try to rape her in high school—it just wasn’t Kavanaugh, who is sincere and correct in his assertion of innocence. Indeed, this was the exact argument made by many Senate Republicans, eager to thread a needle between the two contradictory testimonies and get Kavanaugh confirmed.
        
          It worked to whatever extent it had to, given that Kavanaugh is now a Supreme Court justice. But believers in the theory of mistaken identity should reconsider because the error they’ve made matters greatly to Ford’s story, and to how we understand and process sexual assault more broadly.
        
          It makes no sense to take an empirically proven cause of wrongful convictions in stranger rape cases and apply it to a teenager’s attempt to force himself on a female acquaintance. Comparing these two radically different sexual attacks is the equivalent of comparing apples to sushi. The conflation of the particularized trauma experienced by sexual assault survivors also trivializes the fact that the majority of mistaken identifications happen in stranger rape cases where the assailant is black and the victim is white. Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University and an expert on mistaken identifications, said he was “flabbergasted” when the theory was floated by credible people from across the political spectrum. “To call it hogwash is giving too much credit to hogs,” he said. “It’s just absurd.”
        
          One of us, Jennifer, is a survivor of both an attempted sexual assault by an acquaintance in high school and a rape at knifepoint by a stranger in college. Her recollection of both events helps to highlight their difference. In the summer of 1976, when Jennifer was 14, her friend invited her to spend the weekend with her family at the beach. One afternoon, after Jennifer went upstairs to her bedroom to change her sanitary napkin, her friend’s father came in unexpectedly. He walked toward her, telling her how pretty she was and backing her into a corner. Jennifer awkwardly pulled up her jeans, pushed him away, and was able to slip under his arms to run downstairs.
        
          Some details are lost: the color of her friend’s father’s shirt that day, the day of the week, even the name of the beach. But Jennifer can tell you this: He was white, average height, with brown hair, and his name was Jack. On a good day, he bore a passing resemblance to a well-known movie star, and he was considered to be an upstanding member of the community. Years later, he became the mayor of the town where they lived. Though the incident happened more than 40 years ago, there is no chance that she is mistaking Jack for someone else. The attempted assault left an indelible mark on Jennifer’s life in part because of the terror that came from realizing that someone she knew and trusted could hurt her.
        
          Fast forward to the summer of 1984, when Jennifer was 22 and a college student in North Carolina. She was awakened in the middle of the night to find a stranger in her bedroom. Holding a knife to her throat, he whispered, “Shut up or I will kill you,” and then he raped her. She knew two things: that physically she could not stop what was happening, and that if she survived, she would remember every detail of his face so that the police could find him.
        
          Jennifer did survive, managing to escape to a nearby neighbor’s house. Asked to provide a description of the perpetrator by detectives, Jennifer was able to give many details: young, African American male, light-skinned, close-cropped hair, and thin mustache. A composite sketch was made, and a man named Ronald Cotton was arrested. Jennifer identified him. She was positive it was him. Cotton was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to die in prison. But 11 years later, DNA evidence proved that he was innocent.
        
          Jennifer and Ronald told their story in the 2009 best-selling book Picking Cotton. Since the Kavanaugh-Ford hearings, Jennifer has fielded several media requests asking her to explain, based on her own experience of misidentification, how Ford could have been wrong. But there is no comparison to be made between the two cases.
        
          Ford’s story isn’t Jennifer’s story of rape; it’s Jennifer’s story of that afternoon at the beach, of an attempted assault by a white man she knew from her social circle. Ford had socialized with Kavanaugh in the past; his face, voice, and body were easily recognizable to her. Indeed, she had socialized with him on the day the alleged attack occurred. And both women’s stories confirm the same thing: Victims remember who it is when they know the person who is trying to violate them.
        
          Ford even painstakingly explained, based on her own academic research, why she was certain it was Kavanaugh. But her explanation, despite being grounded in science, did not quell doubts. On Sept. 30, Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Ford might have been “misremembering who was responsible for the assault.” Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times: “Liberals should remember a basic lesson of our flawed criminal justice system: Well-meaning eyewitnesses make mistakes all the time, and memory plays terrible tricks.” On Oct. 5, prior to casting her crucial vote to confirm Kavanaugh, Republican Sen. Susan Collins stated that while it was possible that Ford was sexually assaulted that night “or at some other time,” there was simply too much doubt that her attacker was Kavanaugh to find in her favor.
        
          That is bunk. Medwed points to several markers in the data that are associated with false identification: unconscious transference, fleeting encounters, darkness, weapon focus, cross-racial identification. “None of the hallmarks of mistaken ID are present in her account,” he said.
        
          It’s worth lingering over cross-racial misidentification, which was a factor in Jennifer Thompson and Ronald Cotton’s case and is not unique. Instead, it is all too common for black men to be wrongfully convicted of raping white women. Black men account for only 13 percent of the population, but 59 percent of prisoners who have been exonerated for sexual assault crimes are black, according to a 2017 report by the National Registry of Exonerations. “The major cause for this huge racial disparity,” the authors wrote, “appears to be the high danger of mistaken eyewitness identification by white victims in violent crimes with black assailants.”
        
          As Medwed enumerated, the chance that the victim will pick the wrong person increases when the crime occurs at night, the crime involves a weapon, and the attacker is outside the victim’s racial group. The likelihood of a mistaken identification grows higher still when police provide the victim with an array of mug shots and say that they have made an arrest. At that point, the victim believes that the perpetrator must be among the array of photographs—it’s just a matter of finding him. In these cases, the mind engages in “relative judgment,” with the victim choosing the photograph that most closely resembles the stranger who committed the assault.
        
          All of these factors played a role in the violent assault and faulty identification procedures leading up to arrest and wrongful conviction in Picking Cotton. None were present on the afternoon when Jennifer had to fend off her best friend’s father in 1976—or at the small gathering at a home in suburban Maryland in 1982, where Ford says a drunken Kavanaugh (whom she saw at least in the presumably lit living room) groped her, attempted to remove her clothing, and covered her mouth when she tried to scream. Attempting to equate these two kinds of crimes—rapes by strangers of another race and attempted assaults by known men of the same race—by claiming each is equally susceptible to the error of sincere but mistaken identification is wrong. It does a disservice to all survivors of sexual assault—the victims and those who are ultimately exonerated.

          Here’s a quick heat check: on Tuesday, President Trump gave an interview to the Associated Press where he pushed back at the growing global outrage over Saudi Arabia’s apparent assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Istanbul. As the savage details of the killing begin to pile up, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s regime has looked less and less like the marauding modernizer that Thomas Friedman believed him to be when the 33-year-old assumed power just over a year ago. What will the whole sordid affair mean for U.S. policy? Enter the presidential bowling ball to tell us.
        
          On Tuesday, during his interview with the AP, Trump managed to suck out any space and time still remaining in the universe, replacing it with McNugget-flavored spittle. Pushing the U.S. ever closer to state of linguistic and moral incoherence, Trump defended the murder of a critic of Riyadh, by comparing the criticism being launched at the Crown Prince for potentially orchestrating the hit as a rush to judgement akin to… wait for it…  the withering criticism of Brett Kavanaugh for alleged sexual misconduct, including assault, during his high school and college days.
        
          Here we go again, he said. Here we go again.

          As Justice Brett Kavanaugh takes his seat on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts’s job just got harder. Roberts, who claims to be protective of the court’s role as an impartial arbiter of law, now must welcome a colleague saddled with “credible” and “compelling” allegations of sexual assault (according to President Donald Trump himself) and marred by serious, unresolved questions about his candor, judicial temperament, and partisanship.
        
          The Kavanaugh nomination exposed a remorseless effort by huge Republican interests to confirm this nominee at all costs—which in turn put the spotlight on the court’s pre-existing pattern of partisan decisions that serve those huge Republican interests. Whether Chief Justice Roberts wants to—or can—address the issues this pattern raises about the court’s independence and integrity is the great question facing his leadership.
        
          Kavanaugh was in many respects an unsurprising choice. He said all the things conservatives expect to hear from a justice: He would respect precedent; he wouldn’t make policy from the bench; he would interpret the Constitution as the founders intended. But for Republican appointees to the court, these platitudes have become doctrines of convenience. With the Republican appointees, it is more important to watch what they do, not what they say.
        
          What the Republican appointees have done, with remarkable consistency, is deliver a distinct pattern of rulings for the big corporate and special interests that are the lifeblood of the Republican Party, often achieving by judicial fiat what the Republican Party could not achieve through democratic means. The Republican appointees have done this not three or four times, not even a dozen or two dozen times, but 73 times. All were 5–4 partisan decisions, with no Democratic appointee joining the majority. On the way to this Republican judicial romp, the Roberts Five allowed no doctrine, no precedent, no congressional finding to get in their way. As a nominee, Kavanaugh talked about joining a “team of nine.” In fact, he joins a team of five that reliably delivers big wins for the Republican interests that had such a big role in his selection and confirmation.
        
          Preparing for the Kavanaugh hearings, we reviewed all the Roberts court’s decisions in civil cases. There were 212 5–4 or 5–3 decisions. Of those 212 cases, the right wing of the court voted en bloc to form the majority in 79 cases. Of those 79 cases, big Republican interests won 92 percent of the time. That’s 73 cases. In all of those 73 cases, there was a clearly apparent Republican political interest. And in every one of those 73 cases with a political payload, the Republican interest won.
        
          How were those big Republican interests served? The Roberts Five have opened the floodgates of Republican-friendly unlimited money into our elections, eliminated historic voting rights protections for Democrat-leaning voters, sanctioned voter suppression, and turned a blind eye to partisan gerrymandering, all helping achieve Republican electoral victories. They’ve made it harder for the government to regulate corporations, easier for polluters to pollute, and increasingly difficult for individuals to get their day in court, where a civil jury of one’s peers can protect individuals against the excesses of private wealth and power. Thanks to the Roberts Five, it is ever easier to discriminate against minorities, while corporations and right-wing special interests like the National Rifle Association regularly win constitutional protections unimaginable to the founders.
        
          The Kavanaugh nomination was riven with special interest infiltration into the process. The vetting of potential nominees was completely outsourced to the Federalist Society and its political gatekeeper Leonard Leo. Kavanaugh had given more than 50 speeches to the Federalist Society since becoming a circuit court judge; he auditioned, and he got the part.
        
          The big funders of the Federalist Society show who is behind this judicial nomination assembly line. To the extent its funders are public (many are secret), they come as no surprise: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the Scaife Foundations—a who’s-who of big Republican influencers.
        
          When the nominee is selected, the political campaigning begins. The multimillion-dollar scorched-earth ad campaign to get senators to vote for Kavanaugh was spearheaded by the dark-money Judicial Crisis Network.  JCN promised to spend at least $10 million to get Kavanaugh confirmed and spent heavily in red states with Democratic senators: North Dakota, Indiana, West Virginia, and Alabama. JCN keeps its special-interest donors secret. But we have learned that in 2016, JCN received more than $23 million from the secretive Wellspring Committee, which also funds the Federalist Society.
        
          The corporate and special interests behind the groups selecting and lobbying for Republican judicial nominees also fund Republican politicians. After the Roberts Five’s decision in Citizens United, we have no idea whose unlimited dark money floods our elections. But we do know that groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Koch brothers spend tens of millions of dollars each election to elect Republicans.
        
          The final special interest play is to turn up regularly in appellate courtrooms, like the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court, using one of the worst-policed tools of special-interest influence in America, the amicus curiae brief. Big special interests, directly or through funded front groups, file these briefs as a “friend of the court” to influence judges as to how they want the court to rule. It’s hidden, special-interest, judicial lobbying under a fancy-sounding Latin name.
        
          Amicus briefs by right-wing special interest groups appear to have disproportionate sway with the Roberts Five. According to an analysis conducted by professor Paul Collins of the University of Massachusetts, in all 5–4 decisions, amicus briefs supporting the liberal position outnumbered those supporting the conservative position by about 9 percent. In 5–4 decisions in which the Roberts Five constituted the court’s majority, amicus briefs supporting the conservative position outnumbered those supporting the liberal position by about 9 percent.
        
          But the story is not in the numbers, it is in the outcomes. In 5–4 decisions in which the Roberts Five constituted the court’s majority, they voted in favor of the position advocated in conservative amicus briefs 93 percent of the time. The Chamber of Commerce, in addition to funding the Federalist Society and supporting Republican candidates, also writes amicus briefs. It took positions in 25 of the Roberts Five cases and won every single time.
        
          As a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Kavanaugh fell right in line. In civil cases decided by 2–1 majorities when Kavanaugh was in the majority with another Republican-appointed judge, he voted to advance far-right and corporate interests 91 percent of the time. Kavanaugh reliably voted for polluters, for dark money, and for corporate interests—with a healthy dollop of anti-choice, pro-gun, religious-right politics thrown in. In cases where conservative front groups weighed in with amicus briefs, Kavanaugh reliably sided with them: 91 percent of the time.
        
          So Kavanaugh arrives at the court a known quantity when it comes to results. This record helps explain why Trump, the Republican majority in the Senate, and the big Republican influence groups went to such unprecedented lengths to jam their man through. They want to restart the 5–4 partisan decision treadmill that cranked out 73 victories for them so far under Roberts.
        
          For Roberts, this state of affairs presents a dilemma. His Roberts Five is now back to full strength and the Republican romp can continue. But a court whose majority is picked by a narrow group of wealthy special interests, and which rules consistently for those same interests, will not long maintain its credibility in the eyes of most Americans. And its credibility is the source of its authority. Polling shows Americans are already widely concerned that this Supreme Court now favors corporations over individuals. The partisan 5–4 pattern gives that concern plenty of foundation. And the theatrical, conspiracy-theory, partisan rantings of Kavanaugh will make it hard to obscure the pattern of the treadmill as ordinary business.
        
          Roberts now faces a momentous choice: Does he stem the torrent of 73 partisan 5–4 decisions benefiting big Republican interests? Or does he double down into a continued payday? The corporate and special interest forces that fashioned this court majority will be watching. So, of course, will history.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/heidi-heitkamp-north-dakota-senate-ad-sexual-assault-kavanaugh.html,"
          North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp apologized on Tuesday after some alleged victims of domestic violence and sexual assault listed in a campaign ad said they had either not authorized the use of their names or were not survivors of abuse, according to the Associated Press.
        
          “I deeply regret this mistake and we are in the process of issuing a retraction, personally apologizing to each of the people impacted by this, and taking the necessary steps to ensure this never happens again,” Heitkamp said in the statement.
        
          The ad, which ran in North Dakota newspapers on Sunday, was meant to criticize her Republican opponent, Kevin Cramer, for comments he made about Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Cramer had called the allegations against Kavanaugh “absurd” because the alleged assault “never went anywhere” and argued that even if the alleged assault occurred, it should not disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court, in part because both Kavanaugh and his accuser were teenagers who had been drinking.
        
          “My point was that there was no type of intercourse or anything like that,” Cramer said. “Well, she admits she was a 15-year-old that had been drinking at a party that—I mean, how many 15-year-olds handle a lot of alcohol, you know, 36 years ago? When it wasn’t that common, by the way. … Thirty-six years ago it wasn’t that common for 15-year-olds to be at booze parties.”
        
          Heitkamp’s ad, in the form of an open letter, was signed by more than 125 people, but the AP was not able to determine how many of the people on the ad were wrongly listed. Heitkamp’s campaign also did not say how the mistake was made.
        
          According to the AP, at least one woman said she saw her name listed in the ad and realized she had wound up on the list after being tagged by a friend in a Facebook post who knew she had been the victim of sexual assault. The woman said she had only shared the story of the assault with a few people and that she “didn’t want it blasted for the world to see.”
        
          Cramer called the ad a “revictimization of victims” and said it proved that Heitkamp’s “personal politics matter more than someone’s personal pain.”
        
          Cramer is leading Heitkamp in the polls, and like Democrat incumbents in many red states, she appeared to take a blow from the polarizing effects of the Kavanaugh confirmation. If Democrats lose her seat, they would need to essentially win every other competitive race in the nation to take control of the Senate.

          The following is part of a debate between Daniel Hemel and Christopher Sprigman over how progressives should react to the right-wing takeover of the judicial system as heralded by the seating of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          It’s true that the Supreme Court is not immune from partisanship. But nor do the justices always vote along party lines—even where the stakes are at their highest. In Ex Parte Endo, seven FDR appointees bucked the president. In United States v. Nixon, three justices who owed their seats to President Richard Nixon nonetheless voted to order him to deliver White House tapes to a federal district court. In the Guantánamo cases, the George W. Bush administration lost the vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, despite his status as the “swing” justice for several years, was a Republican through and through. Chief Justice John Roberts has (twice now) disappointed the Republican Party by protecting the Affordable Care Act from potentially fatal attacks. Even Justice Neil Gorsuch has gone against the Trump administration on an issue—immigrant deportation—that we know is near and dear to the president’s heart.
        
          And, yes, the court can be influential. That does not make it illegitimate. The court’s power rests on a broad consensus among elected officials and voters across the ideological spectrum that we are better off with robust judicial review than without. You can argue that the majority view is mistaken. But in light of the majority view, the argument that the court lacks legitimacy because it is countermajoritarian falls flat.
        
          Those who foresee the Roberts court becoming a real obstacle to progressive change favor a pre-emptive strike. My response is: not so fast. The next time progressives are in power, I think we still are a lot better off with the Supreme Court in its current form as a check. Progressive presidents sometimes trample over civil liberties too—it was FDR who interned American citizens of Japanese descent, LBJ who jailed draft protesters, and Obama whose administration carried out extrajudicial killings of American citizens abroad. The justices were too slow to act in the first case and AWOL on the latter two, but the solution is not to cow the court into submission. If indeed a future court becomes an insuperable obstacle to progressive change, perhaps we should reassess—but we’re not there yet.
        
          To be sure, the next few years will be frustrating for progressives. I agree with you that the weaponization of the First Amendment for conservative ends will likely continue in the short to medium term. We should criticize those decisions when they come down (and for a long time afterward), and we should articulate an alternative vision of the First Amendment that protects self-expression and preserves the marketplace of ideas while not shielding businesses from sensible regulations. But should we give up on judicial supremacy because of Janus, NIFLA, and the threat to net neutrality? That seems rather rash. Take away the court’s power to strike down popular laws and we’re back to a word in which flag burning is banned, the Pledge of Allegiance is mandatory in schools, the press is subject to prior restraint, and public employees are prohibited from speaking out on matters of public concern. The bathwater may be foul, but I’d still rather save the baby.
        
          Beyond the First Amendment context, the constitutional sins of the Roberts court are likelier to be sins of omission rather than commission. Progressives primarily fear a court that fails to intervene when states curtail access to the ballot, that fails to intervene when states impose stringent abortion restrictions, and that fails to intervene when President Donald Trump meddles in the investigation of his campaign’s Russia ties. Defanging the court—as some progressives propose to do—simply ensures the nightmare scenario every time. Better to have a court that sometimes underpolices than to have no cop on the beat.
        
          Which doesn’t mean that it’s too early to discuss institutional reforms. But I don’t think adding justices or limiting their terms (and thereby ensuring more frequent appointments) is the way to start. As my colleagues Lee Epstein and Eric Posner have documented, Supreme Court justices exhibit loyalty to the president who appointed them—beyond what ideology and party would predict. In other words, a Trump appointee is more likely than another Republican-appointed justice to side with the Trump administration, and an Obama appointee is more likely than another Democratic-appointed justice to side with Obama. Court-packing and term limit proposals—which would result in the then-current president appointing more of the justices who serve on the bench while she or he is in office—would mean that the court is even more loyal to the White House than it already is. This outcome is especially disconcerting if we are worried about the court running interference for a president facing criminal indictment.
        
          My preferred approach would take us in the opposite direction. Instead of limiting the terms of the justices, we should delay their start dates. The sitting president still would appoint a justice to fill a vacancy, but the new justice’s term would begin when the sitting president leaves the White House. Thus, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan would have taken their seats on Jan. 20, 2017 (when Obama left office), and Gorsuch would take his seat on Jan. 20, 2021 (or whenever Trump vacates office). No private citizen gets to choose the judge in her own case, and the president—whose administration is the court’s most frequent litigant—should not get to do the same.
        
          If too many justices leave the bench during a single presidency such that the size of the court dwindles below, say, five, we could randomly select federal circuit judges to serve on the high court temporarily. We can argue about exact numbers and backup plans, but the end goal should be to preserve judicial independence rather than to deepen the court’s subservience to the political branches. On this point, lawyers and laypeople of all political and ideological stripes can agree: Kavanaugh’s confirmation is an opportune moment to debate potential improvements to an institution whose stature has been shaken. To paraphrase the outgoing mayor of my city: A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/supreme-court-court-packing-good.html,"
          The following is part of a debate between Daniel Hemel and Christopher Sprigman over how progressives should react to the right-wing takeover of the judicial system as heralded by the seating of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s display of partisan anger doesn’t bode well for the court’s legitimacy. To my eyes, Kavanaugh very loudly made clear what many have quietly suspected: that the justices’ protestations that they are neutral law interpreters—or, as Chief Justice John Roberts is fond of saying, that they are just umpires “calling balls and strikes” —is a lie. Partisanship is alive and well on the court. That doesn’t mean that every case is decided on partisan lines—a lot of the Supreme Court’s (very light) caseload doesn’t have clear partisan implications. But when a case is partisan, the court is too.
        
          That’s why I think the common argument that the court is the “least dangerous branch” is not quite right. It’s true that the court needs the assistance of the political branches—chiefly, the executive—to enforce its rulings. And yet the Supreme Court exercises enormous power and influence. In our culture—which fetishizes the Constitution, the Framers, and the court as an institution (even constructing cults of personality around individual justices)—woe unto the president who refuses to enforce an order handed down from the nation’s highest bench.
        
          The court is in fact very dangerous. Which is why Republicans are so hellbent on owning it. Just think of how Mitch McConnell and his gang denied Merrick Garland a hearing, in the process burning up whatever collegial goodwill remained in the Senate. Here’s the likely reason: There’s a new American governing majority that’s in the process of being born. It’s more diverse, less religious, and, on a range of issues, more liberal. McConnell and the GOP are worried—rightly—that their time as a national party is running out. But before the GOP retreats to its dwindling rural base, it has one last strategy to exercise continuing influence—stack the Supreme Court with right-wing activists. The GOP hopes for gains both short term (keep Trump in the White House and out of a jail cell) and long term (protect the GOP’s voter suppression strategies in the states they control and limit the federal government’s authority to interfere). It’s a toxic strategy, but a likely smart and so far successful one.
        
          Then there’s the promise of more generally frustrating a Democratic majority. Here’s one example of how that might happen: The next Democratic Congress and president are likely to reimpose the wildly popular net neutrality rules that Trump’s Federal Communications Commission just scrapped. Enter Kavanaugh, who, as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, dissented from that court’s decision upholding the FCC’s 2015 order imposing net neutrality rules on the basis of a risible First Amendment argument that net neutrality “infringes on … internet service providers’ editorial discretion.”
        
          Taken to its logical conclusion, this argument weaponizes the First Amendment against all kinds of regulations. As Justice Elena Kagan has noted, the court’s shift toward First Amendment Lochnerism is already well underway. In its June decision in the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates case, the court ruled 5–4 that a California law requiring the sketchy anti-abortion front organizations known as “crisis pregnancy centers” to post notices informing patients that California provides free or low-cost reproductive health services, including abortions, likely violates the First Amendment. The court’s opinion pays scant notice to its 1992 holding in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which the court upheld a Pennsylvania law requiring physicians to provide women considering abortions with information related to adoption as well as the health risks of abortion. In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer noted that “a Constitution that allows States to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of adoption should also allow States similarly to insist that medical providers tell women about the possibility of abortion.” So, mandated anti-abortion speech gets a First Amendment pass, but mandated pro-choice speech gets struck down. Go figure.
        
          The very next day, of course, in the Janus case, the court struck down 5–4 an Illinois law (similar to laws in 22 other states) that allowed public-sector unions to collect fees from nonunion members for collective bargaining. The court’s conservative majority—buttressed by the vote of President Donald Trump’s first appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch—overturned a perfectly reasoned 1977 precedent and ruled that the law violates the First Amendment because it compels employees to support a union message they may oppose.
        
          A few more decisions like these, and we will be facing the prospect of a 21st-century version of the pre–New Deal Lochner court—this time using a partisan reading of the First Amendment, rather than the Due Process Clause, to cripple the federal government’s power to regulate.
        
          I will readily admit that over the span of American history, the court has seldom gotten too far out of line with democratic majorities of the moment. But the past isn’t always prologue. This time, I think the Republicans’ deliberate strategy is to engineer that misalignment, in the hope of stalling the next wave of progressive legislation that I expect (and they fear) is coming. To stall change doesn’t amount to preventing it altogether. But as the great economist and statesman John Maynard Keynes so rightly noted, the long run “is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead.” Before I’m dead, I’d like to see America regain its place among the community of decent nations. And to my mind, that won’t be achieved by doubling down either on our old, terse, threadbare Constitution or on the cabal of nine graduates of Harvard and Yale who “interpret” it. The real task is to reinvigorate our democracy, and part of that, I believe, is shrinking the power of the courts to overrun our citizens’ democratic decisions.
        
          There are lots of ways to do that and some of them are starting to poke their way into the conversation. Nothing in the Constitution says we have to have nine justices on the Supreme Court. So maybe let’s have 13.
        
          Or, we could end life tenure. The Constitution only says federal judges “shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.” As Stuart Taylor noted, the first 10 justices served an average of less than eight years. Only two lived to age 70. The 90 justices who had completed their terms by 1970 retired (on average) after 15 years on the bench, at age 68. Given life spans in the late 1700s, the founders probably didn’t foresee the prospect of federal judges ruling over multiple generations. Couldn’t Congress simply pass a law defining “good Behavior” as service for a maximum of 12 years, or until the age of 68, whichever comes first? And then Congress could strip the federal courts of power to review that law using the Constitution’s Exceptions Clause (Article III, Section 2, Clause 2) that allows Congress to make exceptions to the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction. Article III also gives Congress power to “ordain and establish” inferior federal courts; the power to establish the lower federal courts includes the power to limit their jurisdiction. Or perhaps the Senate could impose a rule that it will only confirm judges who commit to serving for a limited time.
        
          There is a lot that a new progressive majority could do to end our current era of judicial supremacy. And given what we saw with our own eyes last week, it’s time for progressives to start making plans. Expanding the number of justices, adding seats to the federal bench, and ending life tenure—all of these will help curb the power of the federal courts and send a strong signal that democracy is back in the driver’s seat. But there are deeper reforms that a unified Democratic government could push through. I’ll mention one that perhaps would most fundamentally reorder American constitutional democracy.
        
          In the Canadian Constitution is something called the Notwithstanding Clause. That clause allows the legislature to declare that a law shall operate “notwithstanding” a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada. That is, the clause allows national or provincial legislatures to override a court’s decision to strike down a law. The Notwithstanding Clause has seldom been used. But the presence of the clause in the Canadian system is a fail-safe that protects democracy against partisan constitutionalism.
        
          We could have the equivalent of a Notwithstanding Clause in the United States. And we wouldn’t have to amend the U.S. Constitution to get it. How could that be done? Congress could pass a law stating that Congress may override any Supreme Court decision (other than the negligibly small area of the court’s original jurisdiction) by the ordinary legislative process. And then it could use the Exceptions Clause and its power to limit the jurisdiction of lower federal courts to strip the judiciary of power to resist overrides.
        
          Such an approach may seem radical. But consider how deeply rooted in American society is the pathology that has led us to our current emergency. Almost two centuries ago, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that “[t]here is hardly any political question in the United States that sooner or later does not turn into a judicial question.” This Tocqueville took as a sign of health.But he was wrong. In the long run, the American tendency to turn political questions into judicial questions withers democracy. It empowers lawyers and disempowers citizens. It numbs our sense that something crucial is at stake in elections. And it leads us to treat the Constitution and judicial review, institutions that should be servants to democracy, as masters of it. We’ve been fooling ourselves. If a political culture is rotten, no constitution—even one much better designed than ours—can save liberal self-government. Our courts are long overdue for a demotion.

        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/supreme-court-good-history.html,"
          The following is part of a debate between Daniel Hemel and Christopher Sprigman over how progressives should react to the right-wing takeover of the judicial system as heralded by the seating of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          The Kavanaugh confirmation presents a challenge for progressives like me who want to see the Supreme Court continue to play an influential role in American political life. While the justices are no doubt influenced by ideology, they generally strive to stay above petty party politics. Not Brett Kavanaugh—or, at least, not the Brett Kavanaugh who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the end of last month. “Revenge on behalf of the Clintons.” “What goes around comes around.” These are the words of a partisan warrior, not an ostensibly neutral jurist. They will continue to resonate in our memories as long as Justice Kavanaugh remains on the bench.
        
          But while Kavanaugh’s words were potent, the institution that he joins is feeble. The court is, by design, the “least dangerous” branch, in Hamilton’s words. It lacks both the power of the sword and the power of the purse, and therefore must rely on the explicitly “political” branches—the executive and the legislature—to enforce its decisions. It therefore cannot speed too far ahead, or lag too far behind, the existing political consensus. Political scientist Robert Dahl got it right six decades ago when he wrote that “except for short-lived transitional periods … the Supreme Court is inevitably a part of the dominant national alliance,” and “in the absence of substantial agreement within the alliance, an attempt by the Court to make national policy is likely to lead to disaster.”
        
          Nor should we want it any other way. The linchpin of democratic legitimacy is consent, and a tribunal of unelected judges who could dictate national policy without the consent of the electorate or the political branches would be an illegitimate institution in a democratic society. The Supreme Court cannot countermand the political branches unless the political branches acquiesce to its rulings. Historically they have, but only because historically the court has not cut loose from the dominant national alliance—at least, not for long.
        
          Which is not to say that the court is an irrelevant institution. To the contrary, and notwithstanding its ultimate dependence on the political branches, the court still can serve a restraining function when the political branches stray too far from core constitutional commitments. It cannot “save a people from ruin,” as then–Harvard law professor James Bradley Thayer recognized at the end of the 19th century, but it can spur the political branches to reconsider decisions that disregard fundamental and widely shared values. In former Yale law professor Alexander Bickel’s oft-quoted words, the court can remind us of that “which may have been forgotten in the moment’s hue and cry.”
        
          The court has not always performed this function of providing a “sober second thought” when fear and paranoia have intoxicated the political branches. But it often has. It is correct to mention—and lament—the court’s reprehensible decision in Korematsu v. United States, but we often forget that on the same day as Korematsu, the court ruled unanimously in Ex Parte Endo that the Roosevelt administration could not hold American citizens in military detention merely on account of their Japanese ancestry. We should remember the internment of Japanese Americans as a horrific episode in our country’s history, but we also should remember that it was that same court that brought that episode to an end.
        
          Ex Parte Endo does not stand alone. From the 1866 decision in Ex Parte Milligan (which protected citizens’ access to civilian courts in wartime) to the 1971 decision allowing publication of the Pentagon Papers and the post-9/11 Guantánamo cases, the court—usually by bipartisan majorities—has served as a check on the other branches’ worst excesses. Not always, to be sure; the court’s signoff on President Trump’s third travel ban may go down in history as another instance in which judicial safeguards failed. Yet even in the travel-ban litigation, it was the failure of the first travel ban in court (albeit at one level below the Supreme) that prompted the president to pare back some of the most onerous restrictions.
        
          Beyond its function as a check on jingoistic hysteria, the Supreme Court also at times has played a “representation-reinforcing” role, striking down laws that prevent racial and political minorities from participating effectively in the political process. For example, in the first half of the 20th century, the court invalidated state laws that excluded black Americans from voting in primaries. In the 1964 case Reynolds v. Sims, the court established the principle of “one person, one vote,” which led to the invalidation of state legislative districts with grossly unequal populations. Over the next several decades, the court repeatedly struck down state laws that precluded political minorities (Communists, socialists, and right-wingers alike) from gaining access to the ballot. Here, the court’s worst errors have resulted not from overreach but from its reluctance to go further on subjects such as partisan gerrymandering and voter identification. The principal problem with the court’s voting-rights jurisprudence has not been “too much constitutionalism,” but too little.
        
          In addition to serving as a restraining force and a representation re-enforcer, the court has—on a few occasions—gotten a half step ahead of progressive social change. Brown is one example. To be sure, far too many school systems still are divided on racial lines, but court-ordered desegregation has had meaningful effects on educational attainment for black Americans in the places where it occurred. Lawrence v. Texas was largely symbolic, but the marriage-equality ruling a dozen years later in Obergefell v. Hodges was much more than symbolic for the tens of thousands of same-sex couples who have wed since June 2015 in states that previously banned their unions. Roe v. Wade may have been a disaster politically, but the pre-Roe status quo was even more of a disaster for the thousands of women who died due to back-alley abortions in the decades before the ruling.
        
          True, the court also has slowed progressive change at various junctures. But the court can do no more than throw sand in the gears—it cannot bring the engine to a halt. Progressive reforms stalled at the beginning of the 20th century not primarily on account of the Lochner court but because progressives lost control of Congress and the presidency at the ballot box. The court interfered with FDR’s First New Deal but ultimately allowed the most important elements of the Second New Deal to take effect. More recently, the Roberts court made way for the key parts of the Affordable Care Act, and while it did impede the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, the chief obstacle to universal health care was not judicial opposition—it was the Republican victories in special and midterm elections in 2010.
        
          And then there is Citizens United. A far harder case than critics on the left often acknowledge, it is a far less consequential one as well. The much more important impediment to meaningful campaign finance reform is the lack of political will for a robust public financing system. If such will ever coalesces, it is doubtful that the court can stop the popular juggernaut for long. In the past, it never has.
        
          In sum, the court’s worst moments have been moments of weakness, not overexertions of strength. It will forever be the least dangerous branch, but that is no reason to enfeeble it further. Concededly, now-Justice Kavanaugh’s recent testimony leaves one to wonder whether he will supply the “sober second thought” that the court, in its finest moments, can provide. But an institution is more than any one individual, and moreover, we should be playing a long game here.

          The following is part of a debate between Daniel Hemel and Christopher Sprigman over how progressives should react to the right-wing takeover of the judicial system as heralded by the seating of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          The Kavanaugh hearings were a disaster, for the individuals involved and for the country. Most people on the left focus on the fact that a man who may well have committed sexual assault is now set to spend the next 30 or more years on the Supreme Court. That’s undeniably bad. But the problem is deeper than that.
        
          What we saw in that hearing room is that our nation has splintered into two camps that increasingly despise one another. We see also that battles over who sits on the Supreme Court reflect—or perhaps have contributed to—this breakdown of American civic culture. In our national mythology, loyalty to our Constitution, and respect for the Supreme Court that is charged with interpreting it, is part of what unites us. But what if that isn’t true? What if the court and the Constitution are part of how the right fixes the game in its favor?
        
          There are two immediate ways in which right-wing judges and justices might help tilt the playing field in the GOP’s direction. The first is the prospect that Trump judges will move to protect the man who appointed them from criminal prosecution. That worry has only worsened with Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation—in a 2009 law review article, Kavanaugh advocated for a “temporary deferral of civil suits and criminal prosecutions and investigations” for sitting presidents. To be clear, there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits criminal prosecution of a sitting president. But the absence of an explicit constitutional bar may not stop partisan judges from discovering one.
        
          The second immediate problem has to do with voting rights. The GOP’s voting base is white, old, and shrinking. A new liberal coalition—younger, more diverse, more urban, more educated—is set to displace it. But not if a right-wing judiciary turns a blind eye to the GOP’s hydra-headed voter suppression strategy. Using aggressive gerrymandering, voter ID laws, restrictions on early voting, and moves as blunt as shuttering voting sites in neighborhoods dominated by minority voters, the GOP works tirelessly to delay—and potentially halt—the demographic reckoning that it knows it faces.
        
          The federal judiciary is already too indulgent of the GOP’s anti-voting programs. Back in June, the Supreme Court upheld, by a 5–4 vote, Ohio’s practice of purging its voter rolls. And although in 2017, the Supreme Court let stand a federal appellate court decision striking down a GOP-engineered North Carolina voter suppression law that, in the words of the appeals court, targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision,” North Carolina Republicans have already put a new set of restrictions in place, and with the Supreme Court’s conservative majority bolstered by the Kavanaugh confirmation, we may see them upheld this time around.
        
          The federal judiciary, in short, is unlikely to save our democracy. In fact, it’s more likely to join in the attack. The question for progressives and defenders of small l liberal values alike is this: How should they respond as highly partisan, anti-majoritarian rulings only increase by a firmly ensconced conservative majority for the coming decades (plural).
        
          The temptation, of course, the next time Democrats are in power will be to shrink the power of the courts to reverse democratic decisions.
        
          That is a double-edged sword—a reduced judiciary will no longer have the same power to curb a future Republican Congress or GOP-controlled state legislatures either. It could also lead to a never-ending tit-for-tat escalation, with the final blow perhaps coming from the next leader with the authoritarian instincts of Trump but a bit more cunning. That first trade-off would be worth it, but the latter is admittedly harder to grapple with.
        
          Still, progressives must now at the very least reckon with the fact that the Supreme Court never was the progressive champion that the left believed it to be and plot a path forward from that premise. The left’s previous embrace of the myth of the court as a force for social good tends to come from the general view of the Constitution and the Supreme Court largely as a force for progress. The reality is that on the major civil rights decisions of the past 60-plus years, the court has followed rather than led public opinion and has often been ineffectual in the championing of progressive ideas.
        
          This particular brand of the court as progressive institution myth focuses on a small subset of its decisions, and especially those of the Warren court era of the 1950s and ’60s, including Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregated schools unlawful. The left also focuses on more recent decisions such as Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which overturned state laws banning sodomy (which, in practice, were enforced mainly against gay men). But those decisions, and others like them, make a weaker case for the courts, and for the Constitution, than many on the left believe.
        
          Think first about Brown: There, the court ordered that schools be desegregated “with all deliberate speed.” More than a half-century later, are America’s public schools actually desegregated? No, they are not.
        
          The progressive effect of Lawrence is similarly oversold. In its 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, a 5–4 majority of the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia statute banning oral and anal sex, holding that the Constitution did not confer “a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.” What changed between 1986 and 2003, when the court issued its opinion in Lawrence overruling Bowers?
        
          Prior to 1963, sodomy was a felony in every state. But by 2002, the year before the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Lawrence, sodomy laws had been repealed by the legislatures of 27 states and the District of Columbia, and overturned by state courts in another nine states—all with virtually zero public opposition. The 14 states that still had sodomy laws on the books almost never used them.
        
          The court wasn’t leading in Lawrence. It was following. It was tidying up after the democratic decisions of millions of Americans had already fundamentally improved the nation’s disposition toward gay people.
        
          If the left tends to overestimate the court as a force for progress, it perhaps even more seriously underestimates the court’s tendency toward regress. On balance and over the span of American history, the court has in fact done far more to retard progress than to advance it. Most horribly, the court upheld in its decision in Dred Scott the sanctity of slavers’ property interest in other humans. The court likewise approved in its Korematsu decision the World War II–era imprisonment of Japanese Americans based on nothing more than fear and paranoia. The court recently claimed to overturn Korematsu, but in the context of the Trump v. Hawaii decision in which the court upheld the constitutionality of Trump’s Muslim travel ban. In the Citizens United case, meanwhile, the court turned back legislative efforts to rein in the corruption of our politics that follows inevitably from our First Amendment–sponsored orgy of special interest contributions.
        
          These are just a few examples of a general tendency. The Supreme Court has, time and again in our past and our present, turned the Constitution against both democracy and decency.
        
          And then there’s Roe. The left views Roe as a victory that it must preserve, but Roe has actually been a slowly unfolding disaster for the left, and for the country. Unlike in Lawrence, where the court’s decision followed progressive democratic change, in Roe the court pre-empted it. Roe liberalized abortion law nationwide before the nation had achieved a democratic consensus favoring liberalization.
        
          As no less an advocate for reproductive rights as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has argued, the results have been politically catastrophic. Roe birthed a militant pro-life movement that has been completely co-opted by the right. The net result has been a durable rightward tilt in American politics.
        
          The left has Roe (for now). But it secured that victory at a terrible price. Opposition to Roe is the glue that holds together America’s dominant right-wing political coalition. The price of Roe is all the progressive change we gave up when Roe helped push the center of American politics to the right.
        
          The reality is that the court has never been a progressive institution. And it’s not going to be one for the foreseeable future. In particular, the courts aren’t going to save us from the GOP’s voter suppression efforts—it is, in the end, voters who are going to have to protect the right to vote. And in states where voter suppression efforts go hand in hand with popular Republican legislative majorities (and sometimes unpopular but gerrymandered legislative majorities), voters will not be willing or able to turn the tide. The only way to address that will be for the Department of Justice to get back into the business of enforcing voting rights, and that will require new legislation and Democratic control of the executive branch. Again, the courts aren’t going to help. Nor are the courts up to the job of protecting us from a determined turn by the GOP—or, for that matter, by some future left-wing demagogue—toward authoritarianism. The surest protection against undemocratic politics is a vibrant culture of democratic politics.
        
          Ultimately, the left would be well-advised to get over its unrequited crush on courts and judicial review, as well as the delusion that our old, terse Constitution has much to say about modern problems. It does not, and in any event, too much constitutionalism, like too much democracy, can be dangerous to self-governance and can even destroy a society. The surest and most durable route to progressive change is through the ballot box, and not the courthouse doors.
        
          The question, then, becomes how to shrink the power of courts. There are many valid ways to accomplish that—even without amending the Constitution itself.

          The legal left is at a crossroads. With Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and with President Donald Trump filling appellate judgeships at a breakneck pace, the federal courts are likely to lean right for the foreseeable future. Landmark decisions such as Roe v.Wade are in peril. Laws enacted by progressive state legislatures, or by a future Democratic Congress and president, are at heightened risk of being struck down by a coterie of federal judges that is not just conservative but also partisan and activist.
        
          We have been here before. In the early part of the 20th century, a conservative Supreme Court gutted state and federal laws limiting child labor, setting minimum wages, regulating banks, and pursuing other progressive agenda items that had wide popular support. Progressive politicians and intellectuals responded by attacking the court’s institutional legitimacy and calling the very idea of judicial supremacy into question. As President Franklin Roosevelt said in one of his “fireside chats” in 1937, “We have … reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the Constitution from the court.” Roosevelt responded with a court-packing plan that—though unsuccessful on its own terms—did what it was intended to do. An overawed Supreme Court allowed Roosevelt’s Second New Deal to proceed.
        
          At the dawn of the 21st century, we found ourselves at a similar juncture. The court’s 5–4 decision in Bush v. Gore laid bare the reality that rulings handed down by judges are—at least at times—politics by other means. That decision inspired many progressives to ask whether a transparently partisan court should continue to enjoy the power to override the electorate’s will. This time, however, the modal response from the left was not an all-out attack on the normative foundations of judicial supremacy. Progressives focused instead on ways to vindicate their values while preserving the enormous power of federal courts.
        
          Fast-forward to 2018. A Republican again occupies the White House without having won the popular vote, and another right-wing takeover of the courts is well underway. And yet again, the left seems almost certain to divide over how to deal with a right-wing judiciary. Some will say that progressives’ continued embrace of judicial supremacy post–Bush v. Gore turned out to be a mistake. By conceding the institutional legitimacy of an activist and partisan Supreme Court, progressives paved the way for decisions striking down common-sense gun regulations, corporate campaign finance laws, key components of Obamacare, voting rights protections, and much more.
        
          In the eyes of those who subscribe to this view, progressives gave up on democracy. And they effectively tied their own hands by acknowledging that the law is whatever the Supreme Court says it is, which all too often means that the law is whatever the Republican Party and the Federalist Society want it to be.
        
          Others will respond that the decision by progressives after Bush v. Gore to stay faithful to judicial supremacy brought some significant gains. They will point toward post-2000 Supreme Court decisions that affirmed important progressive values while striking down popularly enacted laws, including decisions that barred the execution of intellectually disabled individuals, that outlawed the horrific practice of mandating life without parole sentences for minors, that recognized the due process rights of Guantánamo detainees, and that legalized same-sex marriage for all 50 states. The wiser approach, they will argue, is the one that progressives most recently followed: choosing to fight inside the court rather than against the court.
        
          The two of us find ourselves on opposite sides of this divide. In a series of posts, we will try to convince each other that our own view is the right one for the left. If history is any guide, the left needs to have this debate. Now.

          The new Republican talking point is that Democratic Party is an out-of-control death squad of sewer communists because it allowed women to criticize and confront Brett Kavanaugh and the senators who supported him. Here’s Donald Trump at a Tuesday rally in Iowa:
        
          Here’s South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in a Wednesday appearance on Fox News riffing on Michelle Obama’s famous assertion that “when they go low, we go high”:
        
          Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said in a Tuesday radio interview he is concerned that Democratic protesters who’ve been confronting officials in public are going to murder someone:
        
          Earlier in the week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republican senators were “literally under assault” from protesters during Kavanaugh’s hearings.
        
          All of this, really, because of four women—Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, who came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct by giving careful first-person accounts of their allegations to journalists, and Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, who told Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, while he was waiting for an elevator in a public place, that they’d been sexually assaulted.
        
          When will this brutal, despicable onslaught of defamatory hearsay and nightmarish violence end???
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/fbi-kavanaugh-background-investigation-was-limited-and-standard.html,"
          Almost as soon as the White House announced that the FBI would do a supplemental investigation of sexual assault claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats in the Senate were worried that the bureau’s agents would be limited in what they could look into.
        
          While Trump said that the FBI could interview whomever it wanted, reports quickly emerged of people who wanted to speak with the FBI but were not able to. The bureau would end up interviewing nine people, not including Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford. The investigation was completed in less than a week.
        
          Under questioning from Sen. Kamala Harris on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Senate committee, “our supplemental update to the previous background investigation was limited in scope,” but he said it was “consistent with the standard process” for those investigations. He said it was “specific in scope, limited in scope.”
        
          Wray would not say if White House counsel Don McGahn spoke to the FBI, despite reports that he was a key figure in guiding the investigation. The New York Times reported that McGahn had to get Trump to back down from a request to let the FBI investigate anything because “a wide-ranging inquiry like some Democrats were demanding—and Mr. Trump was suggesting—would be potentially disastrous for Judge Kavanaugh’s chances of confirmation.”
        
          Wray would not say if the investigation looked into whether Kavanaugh lied to the Senate in his testimony, but the Times reported that “McGahn instructed the F.B.I. to do an additional background check focused exclusively on the sexual misconduct charges leveled by three women.”
        
          Trump had said on the Sunday after the investigation started that “the FBI should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason,” and that he was taking guidance on the scope of the investigation from the Senate, which had made the request to the White House following Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s testimonies. The White House and Senate had also made it clear they wanted the investigation to be done in a week or less.
        
          After the investigation was finished, Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, two Republican senators who had requested it, pronounced it to be “thorough,” and on Saturday, Kavanaugh was confirmed.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/the-daily-show-kavanaugh-confirmation-trump-lies.html,"
          In the midst of the emotionally draining last few weeks during which Christine Blasey Ford delivered a heart-wrenching account of sexual assault that even Donald Trump called “compelling” and “credible,” multiple Brett Kavanaugh acquaintances pointed out the apparent lies in the Senate testimony that Kavanaugh howled through tears, and hundreds of protesters marched on the U.S. Capitol, you might have hoped for a #MeToo reckoning within the government, or maybe just an alternative nominee to the highest court in the land. But you’d be forgetting the Trump-era standby: “Nothing matters!”
        
          Or as Trevor Noah put it on The Daily Show on Tuesday night, “Until recently Brett Kavanaugh was just some guy without an inside voice. But over the weekend, after weeks of controversy, soul searching and a national conversation about sexual assault, the Senate said Fork it! and made him the newest justice on the Supreme Court.”
        
          Noah went on to point out that Trump has now changed his tune, mocking Dr. Ford in a grotesque routine at one of his rallies and most recently, apologizing to Kavanaugh, “for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure,” claiming that the new justice was “proven innocent” in reference to a one week long FBI investigation run by Senate Republicans in which several potential witnesses were ignored. “Proven innocent?” asked an incredulous Noah, “OK, that’s obviously that’s not what happened. You can’t just replace what happened with what you wish happened.”
        
          This tenuous relationship with the truth isn’t new for Trump, but what is relatively new is a recent NPR/ PBS Marist poll revealing that the Kavanaugh confirmation battle has made Republicans more charged up for the midterms. There’s no way around how grim all this news is, but as Noah refrained in an Obama voice at the opening of his segment, “Don’t boo, vote!”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/kavanaugh-heitkamp-donnelly-tester-midterms-senate.html,"
          Senate Republicans are downright giddy about the aftermath of the hyperpartisan battle over Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. “It’s been a great political gift for us,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted to the Washington Post on Saturday, hours before the upper chamber voted 50–48 to give Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. “I hope the battle cry of Republicans for the next 30 days will be ‘Remember Kavanaugh,’ ” Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley declared at a GOP dinner in Iowa on Sunday. And Donald Trump predicted Monday, “I think you’re going to see a lot of things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before.”
        
          Such optimism is well-founded—in regard to the Senate, anyway. Remember: The battle for the House is being waged largely in districts where Trump lost or underperformed two years ago, but the battle for the upper chamber is playing out, almost exclusively, in states Trump won, many in landslides. It’s no wonder, then, that Senate GOP leaders are overjoyed that Kavanaugh’s nomination has divided the nation along partisan lines so neatly.
        
          Consider North Dakota, where Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is up for re-election in a state Trump won by a whopping 36 points in 2016 and where a Democratic loss this year would further trim the party’s already-slim chances of retaking the Senate. Like many of her fellow red-state colleagues, Heitkamp has spent much of the year playing up her independent streak and willingness to work with Trump. Following her vote against Kavanaugh, though, she’s been forced into a defensive crouch in a state where an overwhelming majority of voters wanted Kavanaugh confirmed even after learning of the sexual misconduct allegations against him.
        
          “The smart political move would have been to vote for Kavanaugh,” Heitkamp conceded to the New York Times this weekend. Her brother, Joe Heitkamp, a former state lawmaker and current talk radio host, was even blunter: “I can sit here and lie to you about it and say it’s not a big deal, but it’s a big deal, it’s a really big deal.” So big, in fact, that the senator felt compelled to cut a campaign ad explaining her vote against Kavanaugh by highlighting her vote for Trump’s previous SCOTUS nominee, Neil Gorsuch.
        
          We’re still waiting on post-confirmation polling, but Heitkamp was already heading in the wrong direction in limited surveys taken before the vote. A Fox News poll taken shortly after Christine Blasey Ford testified found Heitkamp’s opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, up 12 points among likely voters, an 8-point bump from a survey three weeks earlier taken by the same pollsters. At least one major poll mostly taken before Ford came forward found Cramer up 10 points, so as always we should be careful about declaring cause and effect. It’s possible Heitkamp has been down all year; it’s possible that after months of Cramer and Trump wielding this SCOTUS seat as a weapon against her, Heitkamp was already experiencing some drag from the confirmation debate. But even if her vote doesn’t hurt her further in a state full of Trump voters, it’s nearly inconceivable that it will help her. And right now, she needs some help.
        
          North Dakota is just one race, but it’s one that will go a long way toward deciding who controls the Senate next year. Democrats need to pick up two Senate seats to take control of the upper chamber but currently have only four credible chances to gain one. The flip side of the equation is more daunting: Democrats are defending a total of 10 Senate seats in states Trump won, including four others besides North Dakota that are currently seen as toss-ups. Democrats, then, need to win seven of the nine biggest battlegrounds to win the Senate. Eight of those nine states voted for Trump two years ago, five of them by double-digit margins.
        
          Heitkamp, then, won’t be the only red-state Democrat feeling the heat for her vote against Kavanaugh. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, where Trump won by 20 points; Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, where Trump won by 19 points; and Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, where Trump won by 19 points, will also now spend the final weeks of their races defending their No votes. McCaskill and Donnelly have long been among the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, but Tester joined the Cook Political Report’s toss-up list just last week after he announced he’d vote against Kavanaugh, opening the door for his GOP challenger, state auditor Matt Rosendale, to go on the attack:
        
          Democrats remain hopeful that anger over Kavanaugh’s confirmation will energize their base this fall, and it very well may. That could help in toss-up Senate races in purple states, like Florida or Nevada, and should help in blue ones like New Jersey. But that outrage is of little use in crucial dark-red states like North Dakota, Montana, Indiana, Missouri, or Tennessee. The Kavanaugh fight, then, doesn’t need to help Republicans in every race, or even most of them. It just needs to help in a few contests. There’s good reason to think it will.

          The salient feature of now-seated Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony during the hearing that was intended to assess whether he had committed sexual assault in his youth was, as many have noted, his anger. It was anger that made him lash out inappropriately, anger that contorted his face in a way that made many viewers feel sick. He thought this anger would substitute for integrity, and he was right, or right enough anyway; he didn’t fool everyone, but he did at least shout them down. Meanwhile, the salient feature of Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony was her calm, measured, deferential demeanor, complete with tension-defusing apologies and jokes. I am not the first person to point out how heartbreaking this was to witness: that even while talking about an experience that traumatized her for decades, she obeyed the unwritten cultural injunction that women must manage not only their own feelings but the feelings of everyone around them. This has been laid bare in the past few weeks in America, even as it’s a replay of something we’ve all seen before.
        
          What I haven’t seen discussed, though, is the way these same restrictions have constrained the entire Democratic Party. The left—even the moderate left—is feminized in this country to a degree that I have come to believe actually restricts its avenues for acceptable self-expression.
        
          Our weird cultural commitment to the gender binary goes way beyond actual living men and women—if it didn’t, people wouldn’t freak out so badly when someone declines to choose. Masculinity and femininity are concepts we layer on top of everything from people to pens to political parties. Sometimes there’s a middle ground, but often we seem lost without our familiar patterns; it’s the confused hetero doofus asking a gay couple “which one’s the woman,” except for the entire world. Take any opposed things—Democrats and Republicans, cats and dogs, even the sun and the moon—and you’ll find one of them associated with physical strength, action, and domineering behavior, and the other associated with emotion, reticence, and calm. That’s not just descriptive; it’s prescriptive, and proscriptive too. If we could judge the moon for yelling, we would.
        
          “Everyone is mocking Lindsey Graham for expressing the kind of outrage Democratic Senators should’ve been expressing daily over Merrick Garland,” tweeted writer Isaac Butler after the hearing. He’s not wrong, but it’s worth imagining a similar tweet reading, “Everyone is mocking Brett Kavanaugh for expressing the kind of outrage Christine Blasey Ford should have expressed daily since this debacle began.” What would “should” even mean in this case? She would have been justified, yes, but she absolutely never, ever could have. Crying, screaming, blaming, complaining—Brett Kavanaugh can get away with it. She can’t. This thought experiment isn’t just sophistry; the pressures are the same on the party at large, and for similar reasons. Lindsey Graham can get away with it; Kamala Harris would be pilloried. Even Chuck Schumer would be pilloried. The gender of the legislator is significant, but so is the gender, if you will, of the party. And though we don’t really discuss it, the Democratic Party is a girl.
        
          This isn’t just about who’s allowed to scream without consequence; it’s also about who’s expected to be reasonable and who gets to be stubborn, who keeps the peace and who advocates force, who makes compromises and who makes demands, who can and can’t successfully run a human tantrum for president. It’s also about ideology. Democrats’ concerns are those that are cast as feminine: justice, feelings, women’s bodily autonomy, children, the ability to keep a family provided for and alive. Republicans’ concerns are those considered masculine: money, business, repelling those seen as intruders, the wielding of physical and economic brutality. It’s not an accident that people who are deeply invested in the sanctity of masculinity—the right of men to power, violence, and control—tend to vote GOP. It is not an accident that these same people tend to denigrate the other party as womanly. (They think it’s a denigration, anyway.)
        
          Take the now hotly contested race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke. Even though Ted Cruz is clearly 3,000 bees in a rubber suit, Cruz and Texas Republicans seem to think the grander insult is to imply O’Rourke is ladylike. The Texas GOP tweeted a picture of Beto in his alternative rocker days wearing a dress and being extremely cool, à la the cover of that James album (a cool band). Cruz spoke scornfully of “tofu and silicon and dyed hair” as the main concerns of O’Rourke supporters—silicone (apparently what Cruz meant by “silicon”) as in what you use for breast implants, tofu as in the 2000s equivalent of quiche, which real men don’t eat. (I say 2000s because Cruz, like his ideological kinsman Mike Huckabee, has a sense of humor that is permanently a decade behind.) These are not, in an objective sense, insults. But they are intended to link O’Rourke firmly to the feminine—which is enough, in many people’s minds, to paint him as weak, subservient, and unfit to lead.
        
          The feminization of the party also restricts how much anger, outrage, and general disgruntlement Democrats are “allowed” to express; they are the party that has to be fair, that has to maintain its commitment to the principles of equality and reasonableness. Somehow, at the same time, every trivial emotion of the right is valorized. This is why Mitch McConnell can whine that Democratic nominees never suffer this kind of scrutiny while ignoring his own refusal to even consider Merrick Garland. Of course, this has to do with his undeniable personal hypocrisy, but it is also indicative of his absolute buy-in to, and utter trust of, the cultural restrictions on what’s allowed for liberals versus conservatives. Men can howl about a man’s “life being destroyed” by being subjected to scrutiny for an almost unimaginably prestigious (and lucrative!) job; women are expected to suffer with equanimity through death threats, cruelty, and trauma. Republicans can pitch a fit about the outrageous treatment of the screaming, sniveling liar they’ve thrown in with; Democrats are expected to calmly present their objections, then gracefully accept it when nobody cares. Deviation from this expectation is possible—but it’s also punished.
        
          The problem with misogyny in this country goes beyond the oppression of women—although that alone should be a reason to shatter the patriarchy where it stands. It’s also the oppression of anything seen as feminine: those who show “weakness,” which is defined in our patriarchal system as anything outside the two acceptable masculine modes of brutish violence and cold indifference. Even cisgender men suffer when they are not able to convincingly perform this twisted vision of manliness. One of the automatic black marks on your masculinity performance grade is caring too much about anyone outside the male/straight/white/able ideal (i.e., the people allowed into our toxic masculine vision of strength). The practical upshot of this is that the entire left wing—yes, even the socialist irony bros—is, on a metaphorical level, a bevy of maidens. Our culture is dominated by men, yes, but more than that, it’s dominated by masculinity. No matter how much male privilege you have and regularly wield, going up against cardinal masculine virtues like violence, wealth, and the unchecked use of power taints you with a feminine stain, and in our society, femininity is disdained.
        
          This is not to excuse the men, or indeed the women, of the Democratic Party for the times they are mealy-mouthed or cowardly. Eventually, everyone who cares about pushing the world forward has to navigate the gulf between what is right and what is allowed and decide to hedge toward the former. It’s worth noting that many of the lawmakers who have recently been most courageous (or anyway least craven) in standing up against unacceptable miscarriages of power have been not only women but women of color, despite the fact that they have to contend with multiple layers of cultural disapproval for doing so. But there are constraints on how Democratic lawmakers can express themselves without repercussions, just as there are similar constraints on women—constraints that their colleagues across the aisle just don’t face. That doesn’t mean it’s correct to be diffident and polite; it just means doing otherwise comes at a cost.
        
          It also, to be clear, does not mean the answer is for everyone to become a pushy, whiny, hypocritical liar, even though they can get away with it. There’s a simplistic strain of feminism that holds women should be as demanding, rude, selfish, loud, and thoughtless as men because they’re never punished for it and we are. But this isn’t a situation in which one side should level up (if that even is “up”); it’s more about questioning the bigger picture and finding new rules. It’s more accurate to say that in most cases nobody should be an asshole, regardless of whether it’s expected—that, indeed, allowing half your members to be unchecked assholes is no way to run a society, never even mind letting everyone do it. Should Ford have thrown a fit? Should Senate Democrats have? They have cause, for sure, but it’s an ugly way to behave—one look at Brett Kavanaugh’s twisted mouth should tell you that. There need to be other considerations besides “well, he did it.” Among those considerations: Is it possible to get an equal or better effect without being a jerk about it? Can you trust the people around you to hold up their ends of the social contract? If so, for God’s sake do; we live in a dang society. Politeness and reasoning may be modes that women (and feminized groups) are constrained to, but that doesn’t make them worse—in fact, accepting the idea that politeness and empathy are fundamentally weaker modes than violence means accepting the patriarchal axiom that anything coded masculine is superior. In a functioning society, gentleness can and should rule.
        
          But we are not in a functioning society right now. Christine Blasey Ford certainly showed that she could get her point across without stooping to Kavanaugh-level hysterics, and it probably wouldn’t have gone better for her if she’d pitched a tantrum; that was the right call. But the reason women are being so widely called to access their anger right now is that politeness has become a room we’re banished to. The same applies to Democrats in Congress and anyone looking to replace our failed government in the future; they may have had no good option but to meet pigheadedness with the same. In this case, then, the path forward for a feminized group has already been laid out by the third wave: Learn to be a bitch. Be angry, even if you aren’t allowed. Be ruder than you think you can be (without losing your principles). If they say feelings don’t matter, turn your feelings into a weapon. Never shut up. Never stand down. This is not ideal; it is functionally a commitment to escalation, when in fact everyone should take a damn seat. But it’s one of the only options available when there are two rigidly outlined groups, and one of them has written the rules so that the rules don’t apply to them.
        
          Beyond that, it’s worth considering that our commitment to binaries is outdated in every aspect of our lives. Both the gender binary and the two-party system are susceptible to being layered on top of other opposed pairs: winner and loser, master and servant, loud and quiet, good and bad. Perhaps it’s time to learn to count to three.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/paid-protesters-liberal-mob-kavanaugh-screamers.html,"
          On Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted one of his more alarming and surreal statements in recent weeks.
        
          “The paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven’t gotten their checks—in other words, they weren’t paid!” he wrote. “Screamers in Congress, and outside, were far too obvious—less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!”
        
          The overt conspiracymongering came off as a little abrasive for 8:30 in the morning, but it wasn’t an entirely new argument from the president amid the upheaval surrounding the Kavanaugh hearings. Last week, just before the procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, Trump accused two sexual assault survivors, who had confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator, of being paid by George Soros “to make Senators look bad.” He called them “very rude elevator screamers.”
        
          In a similar vein, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at a press conference Monday before Kavanaugh’s ceremonial swearing-in that Republican senators were “literally under assault” by liberal protesters.
        
          “These demonstrators—I’m sure some of them were well-meaning citizens, but many of them were obviously trained to get in our faces, to go to our homes up there, basically almost to attack us in the halls of the Capitol,” he said. “So there was a full-scale effort to intimidate as well as to eliminate fundamental notions of fairness and due process, such as the presumption of innocence.”
        
          According to the Washington Post, Republicans are using this language more and more, evoking the idea of a liberal “mob” to stoke conservative anger in a party fired up over the Kavanaugh hearings. Here are the examples the Post cited from the past week:
        
          • Trump: “The radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob.”• McConnell: “We stood up to the mob.”• Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: “They have encouraged mob rule.”• Sen. Orrin Hatch: There was “a paid mob trying to prevent senators from doing the will of their constituents.”• Sen. Marco Rubio: “Imagine the coverage on cable news if an angry mob of conservatives stormed the steps of the Supreme Court building” and “Can you imagine what democrats & many in media would be saying if it was conservatives ambushing them at restaurants,confronting them at home,disrupting Senate hearings & vote with primal screams & now literally banging on door of Supreme Court building? They would call it a mob.”
        
          Politicians running for re-election, both in state and local elections, have positioned themselves as standing up against a rabid mob. And conservative commentators, too, have leaned heavily on the “mob” and related imagery.
        
          As the Post put it, the strategy is effective, and Republican staffers who saw protests over the weekend were “elated.”
        
          Thousands of protesters marched to the Capitol over the weekend and before the confirmation vote, and hundreds of anti-Kavanaugh protesters were arrested over the past week. Chanting crowds on Saturday tried to disrupt the confirmation vote and banged on the Supreme Court doors when Kavanaugh arrived for his swearing-in.
        
          Individual politicians have apparently seen a boost from the protests against them. After Ted Cruz and his wife, Heidi, were heckled out of a restaurant for Cruz’s support of Kavanaugh, Cruz had his best campaign fundraising day of the year.

          Should Christopher Columbus be appointed to the Supreme Court? Well, there are several disqualifying factors, including that he didn’t really “discover” America, the reprehensible effects of colonialism, and the minor consideration that he’s been dead for more than 500 years. That didn’t stop a handful of Los Angelenos from defending the explorer’s chances of serving as a Supreme Court justice, though. In an effort to cram as many news topics into one segment as possible, Jimmy Kimmel Live posed the question to passers-by on the street and received a range of responses from “It’s a hard case to study” to “We’ve been celebrating Columbus for how many years now?”
        
          At least one person interviewed was definitely mixing Columbus up with actual Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. “It was so long in the past and there’s not enough evidence to back it up,” she said, defending Columbus’ candidacy. Given the hard K sounds in both names and the pressure of an on-the-spot interview, it’s an easy mistake to make if you’re not listening carefully. What’s a little more puzzling is her enthusiasm for another potential Supreme Court pick, Marco Polo—everyone knows Bartolomé de las Casas is the far superior candidate.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/trump-apologizes-to-kavanaugh-on-behalf-of-our-nation-says-he-was-proven-innocent.html,"
          President Donald Trump used a ceremonial swearing-in of Brett Kavanaugh as the newest justice on the Supreme Court to apologize and once again discredit women who alleged they were victims of sexual assault. “On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of personal and political destruction based on lies and deception,” Trump said Monday evening in the East Room of the White House.
        
          In a room with all the other Supreme Court justices present, the commander in chief went on to say that the confirmation process Kavaugh went through “violates every notion of fairness, decency, and due process.” He also address Kavanaugh directly: “You, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.”
        
          This marked the second time in the day that Trump sought to discredit the women who had come forward to speak up about Kavanaugh. Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters Kavanaugh’s nomination “was caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats, using the Democrats’ lawyers.” In case there was any doubt what Trump actually thought, he made his view clear: “It was all made up, it was fabricated, and it’s a disgrace.”
        
          After Trump made sure to turn the Monday evening event into a Republican celebration by thanking several key leaders, Kavanaugh proceeded to thank the commander in chief before shifting gears and vowing that he wouldn’t be partisan as a justice. “Every American can be assured that I will be an independent and impartial justice,” Kavanaugh said. “I was not appointed to serve one party or one interest, but one nation.”

          It can’t have been easy to try to wring humor, bitter or not, from Brett Kavanaugh’s ascent to the Supreme Court, so kudos to the writing staff at Saturday Night Live for doing what they could with the latest catastrophe. And after last week’s Kavanaugh hearing cold open, which followed the hire-an-A-lister-to-reenact-something-we-all-watched-on-television playbook, it’s nice to see that this week’s cold open had a concept, and a smart one: Treat Kavanaugh’s victory the way Kavanaugh himself would have in his high school football heyday, with a raucous post-game party in the Republican locker room.
        
          There’s no joke mean enough to do justice to the incredible damage the Republicans have done to the country by elevating Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but Cecily Strong’s spittle-flecked Susan Collins impression approaches the right levels of contempt:
        
          Having “Blurred Lines” playing in the Republican locker room was a nice touch, Beck Bennett’s Mitch McConnell makeup was terrifying, and all-in-all, the sketch was as good an effort as anyone could expect to process the horrible events of the week through humor. Meanwhile, actual Republicans, from serial plagiarist Benny Johnson to Atticus Finch misunderstandrist Senator John Cornyn have been living down to Saturday Night Live’s expectations, posting pictures of their own drunken celebrations on social media using the hashtag #BeersForBrett.

          When Donald Trump was elected, scholars of American politics ferociously debated the future of the Republican Party. Optimists argued that Trump had little support in the GOP, and would slowly be reined in by movement conservatives like Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham.Pessimists like me argued that Trump had a lot of support among the Republican base and would be able to reshape the party in his own image after a protracted civil war. He and his allies would start running primary candidates to challenge more traditional conservatives and eventually replace the current crop of officeholders.
        
          It turned out that both camps of the debate were thoroughly naïve. Once Trump became the figurehead of the Republican Party, the full partisan tribalism of this ugly political moment came to drive conservatives into his arms. He didn’t need many actual primary challengers, much less a protracted civil war, to reshape the GOP in his image. Some conservatives, like Ryan, simply decided to vacate the field. Others, like Graham, reinvented themselves as Trumpian populists. Two years into the president’s reign, the Republican Party has become a blind tool of his whim.
        
          I fear that we may now be on the cusp of making the same mistake all over again, vastly underestimating how quickly and thoroughly the Supreme Court might flip—not just from left to right, but from liberal to authoritarian.
        
          As recently as a few months ago, I would have argued that the Supreme Court would likely act as a bulwark against a naked power grab from the executive even if conservatives were to gain a majority on it. For all of my disagreements with them, Neil Gorsuch and John Roberts have, after all, historically had little ideological overlap with Trump. While they might have deeply conservative views on important issues like abortion or campaign finance, they also hold deeply conservative views about the rule of law and the separation of powers. And that of course included a strong commitment to such basic constitutional principles as the importance of Congress or the independence of institutions like the FBI.
        
          Reflecting on my own failure to predict how fast the GOP would flip, the shocking series of decisions the court issued over the course of the past year, and most of all the remarkable transformation that Brett Kavanaugh has undergone in a matter of weeks, I am no longer so sure of that prediction.
        
          At the beginning of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh presented himself as an apolitical jurist. Invoking the metaphor that helped John Roberts ascend to the highest court in the land, he promised to be a disinterested umpire who simply calls balls and strikes. While the charade was somewhat transparent—the court has long since become sufficiently politicized that presidents of both parties pick their judicial nominees in part because they know that they are more likely to be sympathetic to their side—it was also a typical case of hypocrisy being the tribute that vice pays to virtue. At the very least, Kavanaugh seemed to recognize the importance of avoiding the appearance of rank partisanship. The mask he was determined to wear would have allowed him to favor Republicans once he took his place on the country’s most hallowed bench—but not in such a blatant manner as to cheer on a naked power grab by the executive.
        
          By the time Kavanaugh appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to defend himself against accusations of sexual assault, he was ready to tear off his mask and start mauling the libs. If the accusations against him were false—perhaps even if he mistakenly believed them to be false—it would certainly be understandable that he was deeply angry. But even then, it would never have been acceptable for a potential justice on the Supreme Court to give such a nakedly partisan performance, accusing Democratic senators of exacting revenge on behalf of the Clintons and angrily denouncing “the left.”
        
          Perhaps we should be grateful that Kavanaugh no longer feels the need to even pay lip service to virtue. For it allows us to look at the current situation in the bright light of unvarnished truth.
        
          Supreme Court justices are no umpires. They are partisans, and increasingly naked ones to boot. In more ordinary times, that in itself would be bad enough. But in the extraordinary times in which we now live, it is terrifying. For as congressional Republicans have found over the past two years, to remain a member in good standing of the conservative tribe, it no longer suffices to embrace conservative social values or to have reverence for the constitution. Rather, it now means a willingness to ride the wave of conservative resentment wherever it may take you—and of course to back its foul-mouthed spokesman, whatever he might choose to do.
        
          In the past year, conservatives on the court have already shown just how far they are willing to go in abandoning basic principles of political fairness if it happens to help their side. They have approved the Muslim ban by pretending, on the flimsiest of evidence, that it is not in fact a Muslim ban. They have allowed Ohio to purge its voter rolls in a transparent attempt to tip the state’s precarious political balance in the direction of the Republican Party. And they have upheld Texan electoral maps that had clearly been gerrymandered with a view to reduce the voice of African-American voters and make it more difficult for Democrats to get elected.
        
          It doesn’t take an outsized imagination to envisage how conservatives, emboldened by their newfound majority, and carried along on the great wave of tribal anger, might in good time go one step further. If Trump managed to take full control of the FBI and the agency started to investigate the Democratic candidate in a presidential election, would they be sure to stop it? And if law enforcement agencies that are increasingly loyal to the president presented evidence suggesting that a key election result was tarnished by hacking or mass voter fraud, would they be sure to rule in an impartial manner?
        
          The answer, it now seems to me, depends less on the integrity of the umpires-cum-partisans on the Supreme Court than it does on public opinion. Political scientists have long known that, in most democracies around the world, support for the government is a good predictor of court behavior, especially in times of great political strife: When an unpopular ruler with an authoritarian bend tries to stay in power through dubious means, judges usually live up to their responsibility of stopping him. But when a would-be authoritarian is carried along by significant public support, they rarely play their constitutionally mandated role.
        
          Until recently, it may have been tempting to think that these lessons from foreign lands do not apply to the United States, a country with a much longer democratic tradition. But the similarity between the rise of Donald Trump and the experience of so many other embattled democracies is too obvious for us to keep believing such a clean distinction.
        
          So, bearing in my mind how difficult it is to see around the next corner when history is intent on moving in an impetuous zig-zag, here is my prediction for the coming years: If Trump remains as unpopular as he is today, the conservative Supreme Court will skew the playing field even further to the Republicans’ advantage through a series of rulings on gerrymandering, voter fraud, and felons’ enfranchisement. But the court will not play along with a full assault on the independence of other institutions or with attempts to undermine how free (as opposed to how fair) elections are. If Trump, however, should somehow become significantly more popular than he is now—or do much better in the midterms than widely expected—the Supreme Court might change as radically over the next two years as the Republican-dominated Congress has over the past two.
        
          All things considered, this is good news. After all, Trump remains unlikely to win over the many millions of Americans who intensely disapprove of him. Democrats are likely to win the House. They have a good chance of winning back the presidency in 2020. Doom is by no means foreordained.
        
          But it is also a reminder of just how high the stakes of electoral politics now are. For the guardrails that seemed so solid as recently as two years ago have been shown to be infinitely bendable. If “We, the People” fail to constrain the current president, we can no longer rely on the Republicans in Congress, or the Republicans on the Supreme Court, to do so on our behalf.

          On July 10, one day after President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, reporters in the Capitol were trying to suss out Maine Sen. Susan Collins’ impressions of the judge. One asked if she was concerned that Kavanaugh might gut the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as yet another lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general sought to do. After a subtle jab about how Democrats were emphasizing the issue because it was more “unifying” for their caucus than Roe v. Wade, Collins suggested that fears of Kavanaugh’s health care views were overblown, and that he was a moderate.
        
          “The justice has already rendered one decision on the Affordable Care Act that, frankly, was criticized by conservatives of not going far enough,” she said.
        
          A couple days later, Collins was asked if she had concerns about the 2009 law review article Kavanaugh authored arguing that Congress should pass a law deferring criminal or civil proceedings against a sitting president until after they left office. She gave an odd answer.
        
          “This was long before there was a Russia investigation,” she said, “and long before Donald Trump was president. So I think those who are trying to draw a link here are missing the timeline.”
        
          Collins returned to these issues in the 45-minute speech she delivered on the Senate floor Friday afternoon announcing that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. As she rejected criticism after criticism about how Kavanaugh would harm protections for pre-existing conditions (he is a strong believer in severability!), or rule to benefit a president under investigation (nominees in the past have consistently ruled against the presidents who appointed them!), or against same-sex couples’ rights (no, he’s cool with them) or Roe v. Wade (some judges merely nod to precedent, but Kavanaugh friggin’ loves precedent), I was transported back to those early days of the nomination. Or to her brief appearance before the press following her two-hour sit-down with Kavanaugh, in late August, when she was pleased to report that Kavanaugh had told her he considered Roe to be “settled law.” Or to the protracted fight over which of Kavanaugh’s White House records senators could review, when she said there was no need to look at those from his tenure as White House staff secretary.
        
          Collins had always, on policy, process or past allegations, been in the same place: Working to give Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt, and hearing what she needed to hear to get herself to yes.
        
          While some of her arguments on the Senate floor today made sense—presidents under investigation have made and can make Supreme Court nominations—others strained credulity, or fell into bad faith. She described Kavanaugh’s apparent belief that there’s a constitutional obligation to respect precedent, unless the precedent is a truly grievous injustice, like Plessy v. Ferguson. How is she to know that Kavanaugh doesn’t view Roe as a similar injustice, as millions of Americans do? A view that the conservative legal community has organized itself around for decades?
        
          Collins fawned over the American Bar Association giving Kavanaugh its “highest possible rating,” a frequent talking point, without noting that the ABA had said Friday morning that it was reevaluating that rating in light of recent temperamental concerns. Most egregiously, she spoke of how “interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination” and “whipping” their supporters “into a frenzy,” without once mentioning the Judicial Crisis Network, the big-spending pro-Kavanaugh group doing the same.
        
          This speech was not purely an act of partisan loyalty. Collins works to find her way to yes on any president’s Supreme Court nominees, having voted, now, for the last six, from three different presidents. That was her mindset when Kavanaugh was nominated, when she was vetting his record, and when the allegations surfaced. And that’s where she was on Friday.
        
          The stakes are different this time, though. Collins worked her way to yes on a nominee who would move the center of the court ideologically in a way that the previous nominees hadn’t. Her arguments that Kavanaugh wouldn’t meaningfully hurt access to abortion, same-sex rights, protections for people with pre-existing conditions, or anything else she flicked away will be judged by history. She could be right. But all of those Republican senators who watched the speech from the floor, and embraced Collins afterwards? They don’t want the Kavanaugh that Collins promised us. And they could be right, too.

          Republican Sen. Susan Collins announced on Friday afternoon that she would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, defying a well-funded, months-long campaign to sway her the other way. As a senator who occasionally votes against her own party, especially on issues of reproductive rights, Collins was considered one of two or three deciding votes on Kavanaugh. Now that she and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin have thrown their support behind him, his confirmation is all but assured.
        
          Collins’ 40-minute speech on the Senate floor offered a wide-ranging critique of the strategies employed by Kavanaugh’s opponents and a detailed account of all the decisions in his judicial record that supposedly show his impartiality. It took about half an hour for the senator from Maine to get to the sexual assault and harassment allegations against Kavanaugh. When she did, she went on an excruciatingly cynical and unnecessarily cruel rant about the unbelievability of Christine Blasey Ford’s story, a diatribe that was utterly unconcerned with the psychology of traumatic memory recall and the specifics of Ford’s allegations.
        
          In her soliloquy, Collins listed every reason she doubted Ford’s sworn testimony that Kavanaugh had tackled her on a bed, covered her mouth, and attempted to rape her at a high school gathering in the early 1980s. “The four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred,” Collins said. “None of the individuals professor Ford says were at the party has any recollection at all of that night.” She listed the people who denied the assault took place—Kavanaugh and alleged participant Mark Judge—and those Ford said were there but have professed they can’t remember any such party. Collins said it was telling that even Ford’s friend, Leland Keyser, said she didn’t know Kavanaugh or remember any such gathering. Collins implied that it was fishy that, though Ford said she couldn’t remember how she got home immediately after the alleged assault, no one has come forward to say they drove her home. Finally, she noted with audible suspicion that Ford had said she’d fled the gathering abruptly, yet no one called her the next day to ask if she was OK, “not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser.”
        
          There was no reason for Keyser to remember what, for her, would likely have been an unremarkable evening drinking with a group of boys she may or may not have known. There is also no reason to believe that Judge would admit to an alleged assault or that the other alleged attendee, P.J. Smyth, would throw his friend under the bus. Experts also say that it’s common among trauma survivors to remember the essential, emotionally charged facts of an assault—like the identity of a known perpetrator—while the surrounding details and aftermath get blurred.
        
          But Collins’ unabashed disregard for these truths was still less sickening than her decision to tell the entire country why she thinks Ford is either lying about her assault or, in what seems to be an increasingly popular GOP theory, confused about who the perpetrator was. Collins said Ford’s testimony was “sincere, painful, and compelling,” that she believes Ford “is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life.” Still, she refuses to believe Kavanaugh perpetrated that assault. Is Ford lying or messed up in the head? Collins doesn’t say.
        
          Over the past few weeks, survivors of sexual violence have watched conservatives mock them, call them paid actors, and tell them that a false accusation of sexual assault is nearly as damaging as an actual sexual assault. They have been forced to relive their own interior monologues of shame, self-blame, and self-doubt while confronting the fact that no matter how respectable a victim they are, no matter how “sincere, painful, and compelling” their testimonies, no matter how much they risk to tell their truths, they will rarely be able to bring their assailants to justice—even when justice means something as pitifully inadequate as keeping a man on the second-highest court in the land instead of the first.
        
          Susan Collins could have just praised Kavanaugh’s judicial record, affirmed her “yes” vote, and left it at that. Instead, she made Ford out to be an unreliable narrator, a stand-in for all women who’ve been told their allegations against God-fearing, Ivy League–educated carpool dads are too far-fetched to be believed.

          On Friday afternoon, as Maine Sen. Susan Collins gave a speech on the Senate floor explaining why she would vote in favor of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, the progressive crowdfunding platform Crowdpac began receiving a flood of campaign donations for her eventual Democratic challenger when she runs for re-election in 2020. In fact, it appears that Crowdpac was deluged by so many donations that it shut down due to an internal server error. The website is still down as of this writing.
        
          As Kavanaugh’s messy confirmation fight was raging over the past few weeks, Crowdpac had been collecting donation pledges ranging from $1 to $2,700 for two progressive Maine groups that would use the funds toward unseating Collins. However, the conceit was that these donations would only be processed if Collins voted “Yes” on Kavanaugh, since she was seen as one of the handful of senators who were on the fence about the nomination. Collins, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Republican election lawyer Cleta Mitchell alleged that this fundraising effort amounted to a bribery scheme to pressure the Maine senator into voting against Kavanaugh. The crowdfunding campaign had raised more than $1 million by early September.
        
          When Collins announced that she would in fact be supporting the nominee, donations for her eventual opponent skyrocketed. Earlier in the day, the raised funds stood at around $1.8 million. Because the Crowdpac site is currently down, it’s difficult to tell just how much money the campaign managed to raise after Collins’ decision became clear, but reports suggest that the total amount raised blew past the $2 million mark while she was still speaking.
        
          Crowdpac announced that it will be back online shortly.

          And so ends what little suspense remained. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin announced Friday afternoon that they intend to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, handing Mitch McConnell the votes he needs to give Donald Trump’s nominee a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.
        
          “We’ve heard a lot of charges and countercharges about Judge Kavanaugh, but as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father,” Collins said during a lengthy speech on the Senate floor, which began after a brief interruption from anti-Kavanaugh protesters in the gallery. “Despite the turbulent, bitter fight surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5–4 decisions and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored.” She then finished: “I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.”
        
          After Collins made her intentions clear, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin followed suit, releasing a statement that he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite his “reservations” about the sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as his temperament during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “However, based on all of the information I have available to me, including the recently completed FBI report, I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him,” the West Virginia Democrat said.
        
          Collins and Manchin were 2 of 51 senators who voted Friday morning to cut off debate on confirmation, a procedural maneuver that cleared the way for a final vote, tentatively set for Saturday evening. (Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski was the lone Republican to vote against cloture; Manchin the lone Democrat to vote for it.) At the time, though, Collins told reporters that she would make an announcement this afternoon about her ultimate decision regarding confirmation, which left the door open ever so slightly that she might, just might, vote against Kavanaugh when it mattered most. Collins has now slammed that door shut.
        
          Vice President Mike Pence was ready to deliver the tiebreaking vote for Kavanaugh in the event the Senate split 50-50. Technically, then, Collins or Manchin alone couldn’t have kept Kavanaugh off the high court. But if Collins would have flipped, that would have given Manchin cover to do the same. It was painfully clear that Manchin never wanted to be the 50th vote, and he had refused to say whether his confirmation vote would be the same as his cloture vote until after Collins took the floor on Friday afternoon.
        
          Despite all the speculation and suspense, the GOP math was always pretty simple. With a 51–49 majority, Republicans needed to limit their defections to just one. The three usual suspects quickly emerged as Democrats’ best bets: Murkowski, Collins, and retiring Sen. Jeff Flake. The three teamed up last Friday to force their party to allow the FBI to conduct a limited investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. After viewing the FBI report on Thursday, though, Collins and Flake appeared ready to get this thing over with. Now, they effectively have.

          On Friday morning, as he was walking into the secure reading room where the FBI’s supplemental background check on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was being kept, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters he might not be sure how he would vote on Kavanaugh until he walked onto the Senate floor. Perhaps that was because he wouldn’t know how Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins would vote until he reached the floor.
        
          Manchin was in the Senate chamber when the procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination was about to begin, but disappeared when the roll call started. The three other must-watch votes didn’t go anywhere. Collins and Murkowski sat next to each other and appeared to be in good spirits, whispering to each other and smiling.
        
          Collins, an “aye,” went first. This was no surprise—her team had announced that she would vote to advance the nomination shortly before she walked on the floor. She would give a speech announcing her final vote later. Flake, too, delivered his “aye” on the first reading of the roll call.
        
          When the clerk read Manchin’s name the first time, though, he was nowhere to be heard.
        
          Murkowski’s name came up shortly after Manchin’s. She slowly rose up and said, in the quietest voice … what did she say? The press gallery, for which seats needed to be reserved to watch this vote, stirred, as few reporters were certain of what they’d heard. It was eventually confirmed that she had, in fact, said “no,” and the commotion died down. Murkowski, a few minutes after casting what she would call the most difficult vote of her tenure, resumed smiling and talking to Collins.
        
          With Flake and Collins already on the record, Republicans had 50 votes to end debate. The outcome was determined. What a great time, then, for the West Virginia senator to return to his seat in the chamber. He wouldn’t have to cast the deciding vote. Unlike Sens. Joe Donnelly, Jon Tester, Claire McCaskill, and Heidi Heitkamp, who all swallowed extremely difficult “no” votes, Manchin—who’s up comfortably in his race—took the free “aye,” delivering a hearty thumbs-up to the clerk.
        
          He was mostly left alone afterward. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine went over to talk to him briefly, as did one of his aides. Otherwise, he just fiddled with his phone until the 51–49 vote was concluded, and he quickly left the chamber.
        
          When I asked him in the basement if he would also be an “aye” on the final vote, he said that his office would have a statement later.
        
          Would he have to wait for Collins to go first on that one, too?
        "

          This post is being updated and revised throughout the day to include additional information as news develops. 
        
          Brett Kavanaugh is one giant step closer to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. The Senate voted Friday morning to bring an end to debate on his confirmation, the last major procedural hurdle standing in the way of a final vote, which could now happen as soon as Saturday.
        
          The cloture vote was 51–49. In a bit of a surprise, the four wildcards did not split entirely along party lines. Republicans Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Jeff Manchin of West Virginia all voted to proceed. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski voted against. Manchin and Murkowski were the only senators to break with their party and essentially canceled out each other.
        
          So is this thing over? Not technically and not necessarily—but, it certainly looks that way. Nothing that happened in the immediate aftermath of Friday’s test vote suggests Saturday’s final one will play out differently.
        
          Speaking to reporters in the Capitol, Flake said shortly after voting for cloture that he’d also vote for confirmation “unless something big changed.” The retiring GOP senator, who along with Collins and Murkowski forced their party to allow this week’s limited FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, added that he doesn’t “see what would” change, and that he expects Donald Trump’s nominee to be confirmed. “I’m glad we had a better process,” he said. “We needed a better process.”
        
          Murkowski, meanwhile, said her “no” vote Friday was the “most difficult” one she’s made in her political career and that she hadn’t made up her mind until she walked on to the Senate floor Friday morning. “I have been wrestling to really try to know what is fair and what is right and the truth is that none of this has been fair,” she told a gaggle of reporters, according to the Washington Post. “This hasn’t been fair to the judge, but I also recognize that we need to have institutions that are viewed as fair and if people who are victims … feel that there is no fairness in our system of government, particularly within our courts, we’ve gone down a path that is not good and right for this country.” She continued: “And so I have been wrestling with whether or not this was about [the] qualifications of a good man or is this bigger than the nominee? And I believe we are dealing with issues right now that are bigger than a nominee.”
        
          Republicans hold a 51–49 advantage in the Senate—with Vice President Mike Pence standing by as the potential tiebreaker—so they could still seat Kavanaugh even if they lose one vote between cloture and confirmation.
        
          It’s theoretically possible that some combination of Collins, Flake, and Manchin could still change their mind between now and the final vote. There’s nothing that requires a senator who votes for cloture to also vote for the final product. The late John McCain, for instance, famously voted to end debate on the GOP’s so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare last year before ultimately killing it with a dramatic, late-night thumbs down. But the difference then was that there was a chance, however small, that McCain could have used the time between cloture and final passage to force Republicans to address specific concerns he had with that legislation. There’s no tweaking Kavanaugh’s confirmation at this point: Either the Senate seats him on the high court or it doesn’t.
        
          Another sign the writing is on the wall: Former Tennessee governor and current Democratic Senate hopeful Phil Bredesen announced his support for Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Friday morning. Bredesen represents one of Democrats’ few chances to flip a GOP seat this fall, and his defection, much like Manchin’s, appears designed to boost his independent cred in a red state as a way to salvage a few political points out of what otherwise looks to be a disaster for his party.
        
          And yet, Collins is keeping the suspense alive, at least for a few more hours. She told reporters before Friday’s vote that, while she’d vote for cloture, she’d also make an announcement this afternoon about her ultimate decision regarding confirmation. Manchin would clearly prefer not to be the deciding vote, so he could conceivably flip his vote if Collins does, leaving the GOP one vote shy of the 50 they need to get Pence involved. And one final small wrinkle: GOP Sen. Steve Daines of Montana says he’ll be busy walking his daughter down the aisle on Saturday, making him unavailable to vote for part of the day. That could force Mitch McConnell to hold the vote open if needed, giving Democrats a few more hours to twist arms. There is, then, still the slightest crack in the door. At this point, though, there’s little reason to suspect the final vote will be significantly different than Friday’s.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/trump-sexual-assault-survivors-paid-protesters.html,"
          With less than two hours before the Senate procedural vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, President Trump—who, as the conflict over the Supreme Court nominee grew hotter, became less restrained, vocalizing increasingly explicitly his frustrations toward the alleged victim of sexual assault and her supporters and going so far as to openly mock Christine Blasey Ford—appeared set to finish out the final morning before the vote with overt conspiracy-mongering.
        
          On Friday, at about 9 a.m., Trump tweeted his theory about the survivors of sexual assault who confronted Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator last week after he said he would vote for the nominee.
        
          As with the best conspiracy theories, this one starts from a tiny bit of truth that is stretched to absurd lengths. Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, the two protesters, both work at a nonprofit called Center for Popular Democracy, which has received money from George Soros. That, of course, has nothing to do with their own experience of having been assaulted. “I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me,” Gallagher said. “I didn’t tell anyone, and you’re telling all women that they don’t matter.”
        
          The protesters-paid-for-by-Soros theory has been a popular one among conspiracy-minded conservatives since Trump’s election. Trump himself has promoted the theory in the past, but it is possibly surprising that he chose to question the relatively small elevator protests rather than the thousands who marched to the Capitol on Thursday. Instead, by dismissing the professed survivors of sexual assault as liars, he took the theory into new territory.
        
          It may be, though, that Trump was lashing out against a form of protest that appears to have had partial success: They are credited with playing a role in Flake’s decision to demand an FBI background investigation before the final vote. Certainly other legislators have taken Trump’s more tact-free approach when it comes to sexual assault protesters around elevators: On Thursday, Sen. Orrin Hatch taunted a group of female protesters and told them to “grow up.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/mark-judge-book-online-copyright.html,"
          The hottest book in the U.S. right now is almost impossible to get—and unusually so. It’s out of print, costs $1,849.99 on Amazon, and is “not even close to being a good book,” as the New York Times said in its review. But like with most books, you might now be able to get your hands on it at a digital library.
        
          Mark Judge’s book Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk came under the spotlight as Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school and said that Judge was also present. According to Ford, both Kavanaugh and Judge were “extremely inebriated” during the attack, and Judge’s book has been cited as evidence that Judge and Kavanaugh were heavy drinkers in high school. The memoir details Judge’s experience and recovery with alcohol as a teenager.
        
          But on Wednesday, the Internet Achieve, a nonprofit digital library, made Judge’s book available as a scanned digital copy. Initially, the book was uploaded without restrictions, so anyone could read it at any time. This version was “uploaded by someone from the community,” said Mark Graham, the director of the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, in an email. It has since been replaced by a copy owned by the Boston Public Library and can only be loaned like a traditional book. (As of Thursday evening, you’d be 256th on the waitlist). On Thursday, two more copies of the book were uploaded without any restrictions by a member. Could the Internet Archive be violating U.S. copyright law, either by lending a digital copy owned by the Boston Public Library or by serving as a platform for members to upload content? In both cases, the answer is likely a no.
        
          Under controlled digital lending, a library can lend a print book to a website like the Internet Archive as long as the site treats it like it’s a physical copy. In other words, the library will only lend out the exact number of books it owns. Controlled digital lending tries to ensure that digital books do not get copied and redistributed by readers.
        
          For controlled digital lending to work in the first place, a library needs to make a digital copy of the print work, but making a scanned copy of a physical book generally infringes upon copyright laws. However, Judge’s book likely falls under fair use, says Annemarie Bridy, professor of law at the University of Idaho. For one, Judge’s book is out of print, so the Internet Archive is not making revenue or taking revenue away from the author or publisher. Wasted is also a memoir, and copyright is stronger in creative works of fiction. And there is a strong public interest in the book, since Judge is a significant part of a newsworthy conversation.
        
          “It’s not a slam dunk that it’s fair use,” says Bridy. “But the controlled digital lending model is careful enough about what they are doing to have a pretty good case that this book [falls under] fair use.”
        
          In the case where a member uploads a digital copy of a book, as happened with the two copies on Thursday, the member is responsible, not the Internet Archive. Keeping the content up would be a violation of copyright law, but until a rights holder asks for something to be removed, the site has no associated liability. “If this user uploaded [the book], it’s not the Internet Archive’s problem until they get the takedown notice or the red flag,” said James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School. “They are not responsible for the ones they haven’t found because they don’t know it’s there.”
        
          Of course, the Internet Archive has a stronger case because it’s trying to uphold a public mission as a digital library, including promoting literacy and access to knowledge. “Copyright laws privilege libraries,” said Bridy. “Internet Archive is just trying to do something that’s consistent with its mission, but in a way that tries to respect copyright.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-wall-street-journal-scorpion-frog.html,"
          I was deeply honored to stand on the river bank July 9 with my scorpion wife to explain to you our plan to travel by frog to the other side of the river.
        
          That night, I told all frogs who I am and what I believe. I talked about my 28-year career as a scorpion, almost all of which has been more or less stinger-free, frogwise. I talked about my 12 years on this side of the river, often called the second most important side in the whole river, and my five years living in a desert burrow, eating spiders and lizards but never amphibians. I talked about my long record of not eating frogs—a majority of the frogs on this side of the river are uneaten—and, after a clarifying discussion of what, if anything, it said in the rulebook about scorpions, as a longtime coach of girls basketball teams.
        
          As I explained that night, a good scorpion must be a passenger—a neutral and impartial rider who abstains from injecting a fatal dose of neurotoxins into anyone else who is helping him or her keep from drowning. Scorpions do not sting frogs to reach a preferred result. Scorpions sting frogs because their nature compels them to. (Except when that scorpion is me, I assure you.) Over the past 12 years, I have sometimes stung flies and sometimes stung spiders, sometimes stung lizards and sometimes stung owls, sometimes stung mice and sometimes stung cats. One time I stung a toddler! In each case, I have made my own decisions, rather than obeying the unceasing demands of my unchangeable scorpion nature. I do not decide whether or not to sting things based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-scorpion scorpion or pro-frog scorpion. I am a pro-crossing-the-river scorpion.
        
          Joint frog-and-scorpion river expeditions must never be viewed as partisan institutions. The travelers do not sit on opposite sides of a sturdy, impossible-to-sting-to-death boat made from metal. They do not sink or swim separately. As I have said repeatedly, if one of you gives me a ride to the other side of the river, I would be part of a team of two, committed to making it to solid ground before anyone—frog or scorpion alike—gets stung or gets paralyzed or gets drowned or gets a valuable but fatal lesson about scorpions and frogs. I would always strive to be a team player.
        
          During the confirmation process, I met with 65 frogs and explained my approach to crossing the river. I was grateful for the opportunity to share my views and experiences, and I believe the seven surviving frogs also found them enlightening. After all those meetings, and all those search warrants, and all those frog bones the frog police found in my burrow, I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations. My diet has been ridiculously distorted. I have faced vile and slanderous croaks and ribbits.
        
          Against that backdrop, I attempted to travel across the river by frog last Thursday to defend my family, my good name, and my ability to lure frogs into my burrow someplace new until the heat was off. At times, my decisions—both in who to sting and when to sting them—reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused, without corroboration, of horrible scorpion conduct completely contrary to my scorpion record and scorpion character. My stinging and stinging and stinging that frog until I was totally out of venom and then stinging and stinging and stinging him some more also reflected my deep anticipatory distress at the unfairness of how frogs would respond to news of what I had done.
        
          I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tarsus was sharp, and I injected a few paralytic neurotoxins I should not have injected. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a scorpion, a scorpion, and also as a scorpion.
        
          Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of scorpion I have been for my entire 28-year scorpion career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent, and dedicated to stinging everything I can, except when crossing this river, because that would not be in my own best interests. I have not changed. I will remain optimistic, on the sunrise side of the river, which is the other side, where one of you frogs will take me. I will continue to see the frog that is coming, not the frog that is gone.
        
          I believe that an independent and impartial frog ferry service is essential to my plans to cross the river. If we undertake this journey, I will keep an open mind with regards to whether or not to sting any frogs along the way. As for my relentless, implacable scorpion nature, which fills me with the constant and utterly irresistible desire to sting, and sting, and sting again, I will always strive to ignore it. I would greatly appreciate it if you frogs would ignore it too.

          Elevators have played an important role so far in the confirmation struggle over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. Dramatic scenes have played out as senators, needing to get to alternative floors of the Capitol, have been confronted by angry protesters. The pleas of women seemed to play a role in changing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake’s mind on confirming Kavanaugh last week, prompting him to call for an FBI investigation before voting. On Thursday, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was less willing to engage, dismissing female protesters and telling them to “grow up” as he boarded an elevator in the Capitol. After entering the elevator, Hatch taunted the protesters by waving from behind his security detail.

          With a confirmation vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination looming over the weekend, the judge took to the conservative-friendly opinion page of the Wall Street Journal to make his closing argument after a damaging round of jarringly bitter testimony in response to Christine Blasey Ford’s public airing of allegations of sexual assault. After a cursory FBI investigation of recently surfaced allegations, and with Republicans limbering up to ram the toxic nomination through, Kavanaugh looked to repair some of the self-inflicted reputational damage from his openly hostile testimony. “I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said,” Kavanaugh wrote.
        
          From Kavanaugh’s Wall Street Journal piece:
        
          Kavanaugh also tried to calm the temperamental concerns that arose from his biting testimony. “Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good,” he wrote. “And I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach, volunteer, and teacher. Every day I will try to be the best husband, dad, and friend I can be. I will remain optimistic, on the sunrise side of the mountain. I will continue to see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone.”

On Thursday afternoon, at a press conference alongside other Republican leaders, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee let slip some of the rage he has accumulated over a process that he believed had hit “almost rock bottom.” And since the media was sitting in front of him, he took it out on the media.
        
          “I would never use the word fake news, ” he said, “but I want to show you where some of you have bias.” He talked about the demonstrators “in his office for two weeks now, both for Kavanaugh and against Kavanaugh.” Some reporter allegedly told a pro–Brett Kavanaugh demonstrator that they were only interested in interviewing those opposed to the Supreme Court nominee.
        
          “That’s a bias that none of you should be proud of!” he said.
        
          It was a victorious press conference, fueled by a sense of euphoric retribution. The last time I had seen all of these senior senators assembled together—including Grassley, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Majority Whip John Cornyn, and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch—in this particular TV studio was at about 2 a.m. the night they passed the tax bill last December. Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination hasn’t passed yet, though. The votes, at the time of the press conference, weren’t even in place. But just about everyone believed they would be by Friday morning’s procedural vote and the confirmation vote on Saturday.
        
          What does the FBI report, which is being kept in a secure reading room in the Capitol Visitors Center, even say? We don’t know. There aren’t any juicy anecdotes flying around. Despite murmurs from some leading Republicans earlier in the week that they hoped a “public statement” or “summary” that didn’t infringe on confidentiality could be released, Grassley said during the press conference that protocol barred him from doing anything of the sort. (“The chairman was clear,” a McConnell aide told me when I followed up.)
        
          Instead, we were left to gauge the report by analyzing the feelings of senators. It wasn’t a difficult job. Both Republican and Democratic faces told the same story: There wasn’t much there, there.
        
          Republicans, ranging from fence-sitting Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to a more-determined-than-ever McConnell, all said that there was no corroborating evidence within the roughly 50-page report of interviews with about 10 witnesses. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who apparently had been harboring some doubts, said that he felt much more comfortable with Kavanaugh now. Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said that he wished the press could read the report because he found himself getting “angry” reading it.
        
          Maine Sen. Susan Collins, on whom this all hinges, said very little following several trips to the reading room—beyond a remark in the morning that the investigation appeared to be “thorough.” Every word she says is an earthquake. That’s probably why the following time she left the room, she kept her silence for several minutes as reporters chased her and her police escort halfway across the back halls of the Capitol complex. Around 6 o’clock, after her third visit, she told reporters that she had finished her review. She would have no statement until the morning.
        
          Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the most unreadable of the trio of undecided Republicans, also said very little. She needed to read more.
        
          Democrats couldn’t muster the energy to pretend that they had seen something explosive and opted to criticize the process instead. At a press conference Thursday morning following a Democratic senators’ briefing, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, dead-faced, told reporters that they would issue brief statements but not take questions.
        
          “It looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House,” Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said. “I don’t know.”
        
          Schumer tried his best to suggest that maybe there was something interesting in there but didn’t really put his shoulder into it. He merely said that he “disagree[d] with Sen. Grassley’s statement that there was no hint of misconduct” within the report. He then returned to the process, which he did not trust.
        
          “We had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts,” Schumer said. “Having received a thorough briefing on the documents, those fears have been realized.”
        
          But what can Chuck Schumer do about it now? Nothing. That helplessness, the recognition that Democrats’ ability to delay had reached the end of its course, was the force animating Republicans throughout Thursday. Empirical data has been trickling in over the past couple of days that the Kavanaugh saga had poked the bear, awakening complacent Republicans. That’s consistent with what I’ve seen from senior-citizen Republican senators over the past week, as well. It’s gotten a little raw around here.
        
          Cornyn, the whip, dealt a message to the remaining fence-sitting senators, a tally that would be down to four—Collins, Murkowski, Flake, and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin—by late Thursday afternoon.
        
          “A vote against Judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be an endorsement of the mishandling of this confirmation process,” Cornyn said. “A vote against Judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person. And it will be a vote for the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign.”
        
          “What I’ve been dealing with, since July the 10th, the downhill slope that Schumer’s put us on, is really dealing with a demolition derby. And they just about destroyed a good person,” Grassley said. “So hopefully we’re about 48 hours away from having a new person on the Supreme Court.”
        
          Republicans are about to get what they want. But in a month, the ones who didn’t, and who will still be mad, will vote

          Mara Keire was 16 when, she says, she was raped in a car outside a party in 1984. Her assailant was a rising senior at an Ivy League university and a sailing champion, living the life Keire—then about to start her senior year in high school—saw for herself a few years down the line. Keire remembers she “found his attention flattering” and went along when, after she’d had several drinks at his urging, the college guy led her into the back seat of his friend’s car.
        
          “It soon became clear that where I wanted to make out, he wanted to fuck me,” Keire said. “I was a virgin, and I told him so. Didn’t make any difference.” They struggled. Two boys opened the car door to find them naked, then backed away laughing. At that moment, Keire remembers, she felt even more helplessly trapped. “I felt I couldn’t go back into the house without further and immediate humiliation,” she said. “The rapist and I were both fully naked. Everyone would know we hadn’t just made out.” Keire’s rapist merely took off the condom he was using and picked back up where he’d left off.
        
          That feeling of terror came back to Keire these past few weeks, much more forcefully than it did in the wave of #MeToo revelations and deeply urgent female storytelling that followed two investigations into Harvey Weinstein’s pattern of sexual violence, published a year ago this week. “#MeToo mostly had me reconsidering harassment and discrimination on the job,” Keire said, as well as the structures that keep abusive men in power. But news coverage of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has felt entirely different for Keire, now a 51-year-old historian at Oxford University. She suffered PTSD-like flashbacks during accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and pored over an old photo of the “misogynistic louts” she says populated Kavanaugh’s fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, when she attended Yale University just two years behind him. More so than the height of the #MeToo movement last fall and winter, the Kavanaugh hearings have prompted Keire to relive the social scene and accompanying sexual violations of her high school and college years. “It made me reconsider the whole infrastructure of people, for lack of a better word, that enabled my rapist to rape me,” she said. “It was like I telescoped out from the rape itself to reanalyze the whole social setting—which was not too different from the one Ford and Kavanaugh partied in.”
        
          Across the country, women like Keire have been shuttled back to sites of decades-old trauma by the stories of drunken parties and sexual exploitation Ford, Kavanaugh, and their contemporaries have told. It feels a bit like this time last year, when the #MeToo movement caused many to revisit encounters from their past, reclassify near-forgotten boundary violations as harassment, and rethink the margins of appropriate conduct in the workplace, the classroom, and public spaces. Back then, each recollection joined a stream of others on social media, coalescing over weeks and months into a torrent of hurt and anger. To witness one’s private, unspoken experiences mirrored and repeated by so many others revealed an unobstructed view of the churning gears of patriarchal subjugation for the very first time.
        
          But there were others out there, onlookers who supported the #MeToo movement but didn’t quite see themselves reflected so clearly in its stories or its aims. For one thing, #MeToo ramped up around instances of workplace harassment—infractions thankfully foreign to plenty of women, and ones that an entire training industry and class of law have been marshaled to prevent and prosecute. Then there was the most prominent effect of the #MeToo movement, the exposure and ouster of famous powerful men who’d abused underlings in their respective industries: an important objective, but not a highly personal one to the millions of women who don’t work for Harvey Weinstein types. The prevailing cultural debate that surrounded #MeToo wasn’t so much about how best to prevent sexual harassment and assault as it was about whether certain acts—questionably criminal, sort of creepy, definitely unwanted—belonged under the #MeToo umbrella, and thus whether they deserved any sustained scrutiny at all.
        
          Ford, and Kavanaugh’s other accusers, by contrast, have made space to talk about the pitfalls of an entire culture of toxic masculinity and sexual misbehavior, one in which most American women have found themselves at some point in their lives, whether or not any single manifestation rises to the level of a sex crime. The overarching themes of the Kavanaugh allegations—beer-fueled high school antics, college men bonding over the sexual humiliation of a woman, white upper-class boys behaving badly—are more familiar to the average American woman than #MeToo movement’s biggest stories, which involved sustained targeted abuse within the context of specific industries. And while the insistent, unexpected rise of #MeToo and its spate of high-profile male departures might have suggested that America was finally ready to hold sexual abusers to account, Kavanaugh has proved that little has changed. Indeed, not only will the boys who laughed as they sexually terrorized their female peers never face consequences for their behavior: They will also end up running the country.
        
          So Kavanaugh’s likely confirmation is primed to incite both hotter rage and a deeper sort of personal reckoning than the #MeToo moment did. In interviews and over email, several women told me they see themselves in Ford, often much more vividly than they could relate to the women at the forefront of #MeToo: Ford’s “indelible” memory of Kavanaugh and Judge laughing during their assault made one woman think of the sight, mid-rape, of her own folded clothes next to her on the bed. The “indelible in the hippocampus” line in Ford’s testimony reminded Lucy Hamer, 30, of the distinctive plop sound her assailant’s ejaculate made on her shoe—10 years after he’d forced her into her apartment building’s lobby, pinned her against a wall, and masturbated. Women I spoke to saw equally clear likenesses of their abusers in Kavanaugh. One woman said the rage Kavanaugh exhibited in his testimony “was too much like my rapist’s angry voicemail six months later, calling me a liar.” Meaghan O’Malley, 39, was taken back to her early teens, when she confronted a popular athletic neighbor about the time he’d forced a mutual female friend to touch his erect penis. “He denied any wrongdoing,” she said. “He got red-faced, yelled at me, told me to keep my mouth shut and fuck off.” Kavanaugh’s self-exonerating fury and baldfaced lies were, for these women and many others, very familiar.
        
          That familiarity makes him a perfect avatar for the aggressive, entitled maleness Kavanaugh’s supporters are fighting to prop up—the very quality women associate with the boys and men who tormented them in their youths, even as they contorted themselves to please those boys. Rebekah Berndt, a 40-year-old critical care nurse, told me that the Kavanaugh hearings caused her to reckon with the pressure she once felt to be a “cool girl,” one who “didn’t mind being catcalled and ogled, who was always sexually open, liked to tell dirty jokes, and could hang with the boys.” She drank to mask the shame she felt, to better perform a role that didn’t come easily to her, and to muffle the instinct that told her the boys’ behavior was wrong. To Berndt, the Kavanaugh hearings represent the “next phase” of the #MeToo movement’s invitation to share stories of sexual violations: “a deepening,” she said, “where women begin to examine the relationships we’ve had with our male friends and classmates, and the behavior we’ve often turned a blind eye to in order to feel like we belong.”
        
          The way conservatives have mobilized to discredit and shame Ford has touched an especially sensitive nerve. In the words of Donald Trump (“If the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed”), women hear their internal narratives of doubt and self-blame. In the lines of questioning pursued by prosecutor Rachel Mitchell and the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee (Why can’t Ford remember how she got home from the gathering where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her? Who paid for her polygraph test?), women hear the parents, friends, and school officials who dismissed their pain or assumed they were stretching the truth. Hamer was thinking of her assailant as she watched Ford testify. “And that’s when it hit me—like, holy shit, I don’t even remember this guy’s name,” she said. Even though the stranger who’d pinned her in the apartment building lobby had told her his name, she would never be able to identify him by it.
        
          Women who spoke to me echoed Hamer, saying that the responses to Ford forced them to envision the campaigns that would be waged against them if they ever came out against their abusers. A 33-year-old comedy writer named Briana* told me that when she was 19 or 20, she went out for drinks with the older male ex-roommate of a woman she’d dated. He bought her drink after drink, she blacked out, and he took her to his house and raped her. “If, for whatever reason, my rapist decided to run for the Senate tomorrow, I would have the same gaps in memory [as Ford], and a lack of corroboration,” she said. “The bar we went to shut down years ago. It wouldn’t stand a chance against any scrutiny 13 years later.” The GOP’s laser focus on the things Ford couldn’t remember from that night 36 years ago provided Briana with a jarring reminder of the peripheral moments from a night lost to time, alcohol, and a desire to forget.
        
          The spectacle of a woman being forced to dig up details from the most traumatic event of her life in front of millions of people predisposed to disbelieve her—and believe her accused assailant instead—has sent Kelsey, a 29-year-old who works for an engineering and construction company, into a spiral of picturing herself before a tribunal. “Now I imagine, if this was me on trial, what he would say, what I would have to say, and how the world would perceive it,” she said. “I saw who my defenders would be, and I saw who would try to discredit me.” Another woman, a 40-year-old-writer, has been unable to stop thinking about the time in eighth or ninth grade when a “really sleazy guy” pressured her into performing oral sex on him. She’s never considered it an assault because she technically consented—“but it was a violation, it was cruel, it was aggressive coercion, and what would I do if that guy was nominated to the Supreme Court?” she’s been wondering. “Would I say anything? Would what happened count?”
        
          Briana sees another important difference between the #MeToo movement, which allows supporters to take a stand against whatever any one person deemed to be sexual harassment and assault, and the Kavanaugh allegations, which are particular stories about a particular man seeking a particular position of power. “We’re not just asking, ‘Is he a criminal or not a criminal’—we’re asking if a man who is capable of doing this should be responsible for shaping our laws,” Briana said. The Supreme Court seat Kavanaugh has so angrily claimed America owes him stands in for all the accomplishments and opportunities women have watched the entitled boys in their lives, now entitled men, take as their right.
        
          The long-term effect of the Kavanaugh fight is likely to be far more political than that of #MeToo, too. Though traditionally “liberal” in its goals and shunned by conservatives, #MeToo was essentially nonpartisan; its first offender, Weinstein, was a prominent Democratic fundraiser, and the movement has identified and censured plenty of non-politicians as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. But the Kavanaugh nomination has revealed one party as far more motivated to punish and deter sexual exploitation than the other. The Republican right, in its vehement defense of Kavanaugh’s alleged behavior and equally vehement contention that he couldn’t have perpetrated it, against any and all corroborating evidence, is refusing to confront sexual violence as a moral issue. Instead, in their repeated calls for due process and a presumption of innocence—and in the scolding Sen. Lindsey Graham gave a rape survivor protesting Kavanaugh (“You should have told the cops,” he said)—Republicans have used Kavanaugh’s nomination as a new front for their fight to constrain responses to sexual assault to the very criminal justice system that has proved incapable of holding rapists accountable for their crimes. Women are unlikely to forget that.
        
          Both the reckoning that came with #MeToo and the one Kavanaugh has provoked feel like essential steps in understanding the breadth and diversity of sexual violations women tote around, usually in silence, their entire lives. And yet somehow, for the women I spoke to, they’ve left completely different emotional wakes. One was a moment of coming together, of empowerment, of strength in numbers; the other was a raw show of male power that resurfaced a painfully recognizable high school milieu that, as the Kavanaugh hearings demonstrated, never really dissipates. “#MeToo made me feel safe, validated, and heard,” Lynn*, a 26-year-old software developer, told me, describing several instances of sexual harassment, assault, and coercion from her college years. “This bullshit brings back all of the anxiety, fear, and trauma of not only what happened, but my fears of not being believed—of shame, guilt, hurt, pain, everything.” The year Lynn was born, Anita Hill testified that then–Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her. Lynn has recently been revisiting that case, digesting the morbid symmetry between Hill, who was insulted to her face by the senators who questioned her, and Ford, who was treated with perfunctory respect—but who, it seems, will be neither respected nor believed enough to derail a drunken teenager’s path to power. “I’ve always been angry,” Lynn said. “But now I’m fucking furious.”

          On Thursday, as Senators read through the report from the FBI background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, thousands of protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court in large numbers for a “Cancel Kavanaugh” march organized by the group behind the Women’s March, among other groups.
        
          After a demonstration with signs, chanting, speeches, and songs, the crowd moved to the Capitol and to the Hart Senate Office Building, where they entered the atrium and began chanting and calling for legislators to reject Kavanaugh’s nomination. According to Time reporter Charlotte Alter, hundreds were arrested—in a peaceful, polite way.
        
          Among those arreested was comedian Amy Schumer, who, in a video posted by conservative writer Benny Johnson, can be seen saying “yes” when police asked her if she wanted to be arrested. In the video, she is holding a “We believe Anita Hill” sign.
        
          In another video posted to Twitter,  she addressed a fan and fellow activist’s daughter. “Hi Zola, I’m here with your mom. She loves you very much,” she said. “I think we are going to get arrested and we’re so proud of you.”
        
          Before they entered Hart, the demonstrators had gathered outside to chant and listen to speeches and songs.
        
          It wasn’t long after the demonstration reached Hart that the crowd seemed to overwhelm the space.
        
          Meanwhile, outside the Capitol building Thursday, a different feminist group had set up a giant screen dedicated to showing, on a loop, the 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which Donald Trump bragged that his fame allowed him to “grab them by the pussy.” According to Roll Call, the video will air for 12 hours.
        
          It wasn’t the only one. A super PAC for Democratic candidates called American Bridge 21st Century plans to show a loop outside the Trump International Hotel on Thursday night, according to HuffPost.
        
          The video has recirculated during the public discussion of sexual misconduct allegations by a prominent political figure in part because Trump himself has reminded the public of the allegations against him. At a press conference last week at the United Nations, when asked about his own history of being accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women and how it influences the way he views Kavanaugh’s accusations, Trump didn’t dodge the question. “Well, it does impact my opinion. You know why? Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” he said. “So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting at home watching television.”
        
          On Tuesday, Trump, who has been steadfast in his support for his nominee, told reporters that it was a “very scary time for young men in America.”
        
          The Senate will hold a procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination Friday, and a final vote could happen as early as Saturday. To defeat the nomination, Democrats would need every Senator in their party and two Republicans to vote against him. Given the comments by two of the three Republican swing votes, things are not looking promising for anti-Kavanaugh protesters.

          Senators are getting their first look Thursday at the results of the FBI’s limited-in-time-and-scope investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged sexual misconduct. With Republicans promising to plow ahead with a confirmation vote, likely as early as Saturday, all eyes are on a handful of potential swing votes that are expected to decide this thing. Below, we’re rounding up reactions from them, and others of note, as they trickle in from Capitol Hill.
        
          The most crucial votes will come from the three Republicans who banded together to force their party to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations in the first place: Arizona’s Jeff Flake, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, and Maine’s Susan Collins. Republicans hold a narrow 51–49 advantage—with Vice President Mike Pence as the potential tiebreaker—so they need just two of those three to confirm Kavanaugh along party lines. The early returns from this group suggest Mitch McConnell has good reason to believe he’s got the votes:
        
          Collins:
        
          Flake:
        
          Murkowski:
        
          Sitting below that trio on the confirmation watch list are a pair of red-state Democrats who are up for re-election in states that Trump won by landslides in 2016: Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both of whom voted to confirm Donald Trump’s previous SCOTUS pick, Neil Gorsuch. If the GOP ends up with the votes to confirm Kavanaugh along party lines, it’s possible that Heitkamp and/or more likely Manchin break ranks to prove their independence to Trump voters back home, but it’s nearly unthinkable either would be willing to be the deciding vote on her or his own.
        
          Heitkamp:
        
          Manchin:
        
          Then a good ways below them sit a handful of other Republicans who could theoretically jump across partisan lines to vote against confirmation if Flake, Murkowski, and/or Collins jump first. Among them: Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.
        
          Capito:
        
          And then there is the rest of the Senate, which—surprise, surprise—is reacting exactly how you’d expect to an FBI report that Democrats were always afraid would not be thorough enough and Republicans claimed would be more than adequate.
        
          GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee:
        
          Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee:
        
          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell:
        
          Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer:
        
          GOP Sen. John Kennedy, member of the Judiciary Committee:
        
          Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, member of the Judiciary Committee:
        
          Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez:
        
          And finally, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, member of the Judiciary Committee:
        
          We’ll continue to update this post with additional reactions of note throughout the day.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-fbi-report-investigation-witnesses-confirmation-vote.html,"
          In the early hours of Thursday morning, the Senate announced that the FBI had concluded its background investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and that it had received the results.
        
          Here is what we know about that investigation ahead of the Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh:
        
          The White House has made up its mind about the findings. In a statement issued at about 2:30 a.m., White House spokesman Raj Shah said the White House had taken a look and sent the report to Capitol Hill. “This is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents,” he said. “With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.”
        
          According to the Wall Street Journal, the White House found no corroboration of the allegations. But it’s unclear if it has yet fully reviewed the material. And it’s not much of a surprise. President Donald Trump has maintained his belief in Kavanaugh’s truthfulness, casting doubt on Christine Blasey Ford’s account and going as far as to openly mock Ford at a rally this week.
        
          Senators will begin reviewing the report Thursday. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced less than two hours later that the committee had received the background file and that he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein agreed to “alternating EQUAL access” for the two parties.
        
          So, according to the Washington Post, Senate Republicans will spend an hour with the report, then Democrats will have an hour, and it will rotate throughout the day, and possibly into Friday. Senators and 10 committee staffers cleared to view the material can review it at a secure room in the Capitol Visitor Center, where only one physical copy of the report will be available.
        
          The investigation was limited to two allegations. The investigation only looked into allegations of sexual misconduct made by Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her in high school, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused him of exposing himself to her in college. The FBI apparently did not look into allegations by a third accuser, Julie Swetnick, who is represented by Michael Avenatti. Senate Democrats have not focused on Swetnick’s claims, as she is considered by some to be less credible.
        
          The investigation was also not permitted to question witnesses about Kavanaugh’s drinking habits, which came up in the allegations and in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, and which some who knew Kavanaugh have said the Supreme Court nominee lied about under oath.
        
          The FBI talked to nine people. According to reports from sources who have been briefed on the findings, the FBI contacted 10 potential witnesses and spoke to nine of them. It’s unclear who the 10th person was and why that person wasn’t interviewed.
        
          We don’t know who all nine of those people are, but we do know most of them. Initially, the FBI interviewed the three people Ford said were at the party where she was allegedly assaulted: Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and Leland Keyser. The three had said publicly before that they did not remember the party, though Keyser noted that she believed Ford. The bureau also initially interviewed Ramirez.
        
          After Democrats criticized the White House for restricting the FBI to those witnesses, the investigation was allowed to expand, and according to the Journal, two high school friends named in Kavanaugh’s 1982 calendar were also questioned: Tim Gaudette and Chris Garrett, known in the calendar as “Squi.”
        
          The FBI has not explained why it limited itself to nine people.
        
          The FBI didn’t talk to Ford or Kavanaugh. Republicans have contended that an interview would have been unnecessary because the two already were questioned before the Senate, but Democrats have countered that an FBI investigation is different and that it would be considered standard for the FBI to talk to them.
        
          An attorney for Ford criticized the bureau Wednesday, saying an investigation that didn’t include his client and “the witnesses who corroborate her testimony cannot be called an investigation,” according to the Journal. “We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward, those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.”
        
          Agents did speak to one accuser, though. Ramirez told the New Yorker that last weekend, two agents drove from Denver to Boulder, Colorado, to interview her. She gave the FBI a list of names of people she thought could help corroborate her story, but she says she believes the bureau did not contact them.
        
          Some potential witnesses tried to contact the FBI but couldn’t. NBC News reported that dozens of people who said they had information about Kavanaugh contacted FBI field offices, but agents were not allowed to talk to many of them.
        
          According to a Wednesday night report from the New Yorker, several potential witnesses who wanted to speak as part of the investigation ended up sending unsolicited statements to the FBI and to senators. One former classmate told the New Yorker that he believed that no one who lived in the dorm where Kavanaugh lived and the alleged incident occurred was interviewed.
        
          A former classmate from Georgetown Prep who remained anonymous submitted a signed declaration but told the New Yorker he didn’t hear back from the FBI. In the statement, sent also to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, he described Kavanaugh as a high school bully. He recalled Kavanaugh drinking heavily, boasting about sexual conquests, and inventing a cruel rhyme about a female student, Renate Dolphin. A former classmate of Dolphin’s said in a statement also submitted to the FBI that at a party with Georgetown Prep boys, a friend had “warned me not to go upstairs, where the bedrooms were, cautioning me that it could be dangerous.”
        
          One witness who said he wasn’t interviewed claimed to remember hearing about the incident at Yale. According to the New Yorker, Kenneth G. Appold, who was a suitemate of Kavanaugh’s when the alleged incident at Yale occurred and was quoted anonymously in an earlier New Yorker story, decided to come forward publicly. Appold, now a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, had previously said he heard of the allegation a day or two afterward and that he was “100 percent certain” he was told it was Kavanaugh. He had told his roommate about the incident at the time, and that roommate told the New Yorker he remembered Appold’s account, as they had both been shocked by it.
        
          He also depicted Kavanaugh as sometimes studious and shy, and sometimes belligerent, with a tendency to drink to excess. He tried to reach out to the FBI but instead resorted to submitting a statement through an FBI web portal.
        
          It’s unlikely the public will see the report anytime soon. An agreement between the Judiciary Committee and the White House bans the sharing of contents of a background file by the committee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the report would be kept confidential, and Chuck Grassley agreed on Wednesday, but some senators in both parties said this week that the importance of the background check should allow for some kind of redacted release.
        
          What might more predictably happen, though, is that senators selectively leak parts of the report. Republicans have considered some sort of “public statement” or “summary,” according to Slate’s Jim Newell. There’s also the possibility a senator could try to steal it and read it—or just summarize it—into the Congressional Record on the Senate floor.
        
          A vote is going to happen soon. Late Wednesday, before the FBI report was delivered from the White House, Senate Republicans set up a Friday procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, saying that the timeline would give senators enough time to review the investigation’s findings. A final vote could happen as early as Saturday.
        
          Republican Sens. Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski—all of whom have said the FBI report will factor into their decision—are the votes to watch. If two of them vote against Kavanaugh, along with all Democrats, his nomination would be defeated. In pretty much any other scenario, he gets through.

          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell strode onto the Senate floor around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday night to do what observers had been waiting for all day: file cloture to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. By getting it done before midnight, McConnell was able to fulfill the pledge he made on Monday that the Senate would vote on the nomination “this week.” The first procedural vote will come on Friday.
        
          Here’s how the rest of the schedule will play out: When a cloture petition is filed, an “intervening day” must be observed before any further action. This will encompass all of Thursday. The Senate can then vote on cloture—whether to end debate—one hour after the Senate convenes the following day. Expect that vote, then, about one hour after the Senate convenes on Friday. After that, and absent any time agreement with the Democrats that I don’t believe the Democrats would ever make on this nomination, the Senate is required to burn another 30 hours before the final confirmation vote. That will come as soon as Saturday.
        
          Thursday will be decisive. With the FBI’s supplemental background check due to arrive at the Capitol later Wednesday night—weird coincidence that the FBI is able to wrap it up just in time to meet McConnell’s scheduling preferences!—senators will be able to look at it all day Thursday through a fittingly stupid process. One (1) hard copy of the report will be transmitted to the Capitol and kept in a secure reading room. Senators, but not their staffs, will have the opportunity to read it in the following order: Republicans from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., Democrats from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., Republicans from 10 to 11, and so on. That’s not a joke. It’s just where we are.
        
          The report won’t be made available to the public, but some senator could always try to steal the report and read it on the Senate floor. Or not steal it and just paraphrase it on the Senate floor. But the former would be more exciting.

          The Capitol Police arrested a 27-year-old former congressional staffer, who appears to have worked for a handful of Democrats on the Hill, for allegedly doxing Republican senators and editing their Wikipedia pages to include personal information, including their home addresses. Police identified Jackson Cosko as the suspect Wednesday night and accused him of posting “private, identifying information (doxing) about one or more United States Senators to the internet.”
        
          During the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, which erupted into a national brawl last week with the airing of sexual assault allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, the home addresses, home phone numbers, and cellphone numbers of three Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee of Utah, were posted on their respective Wikipedia pages. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s home addresses, in Washington and in Kentucky, were published on his page.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/trump-mockery-ford-testimony-sanders-conway-graham.html,"
          President Trump’s surrogates are defending his latest attack on Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. They’re claiming that Trump’s mockery of Ford, delivered at a political rally on Tuesday night, was “factual.” You may not like the president’s tone, the argument goes, but everything he said about Ford’s testimony was true.
        
          No, it wasn’t true. Trump lied about Ford. And his supporters, in defending him, are doing the same.
        
          At the rally, Trump mocked Ford by pretending to re-enact a question-and-answer session with her:
        
          Trump’s allies say this depiction of Ford’s testimony was accurate. On Wednesday morning, at a forum hosted by the Atlantic, Sen. Lindsey Graham declared, “Everything he said was factual.” In an interview with Fox News, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway insisted, “The president is pointing out factual inconsistencies.” At an afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders claimed that Trump’s re-enactment “wasn’t anything other than the president stating facts. … He was stating facts that Dr. Ford herself laid out in her testimony.” Sanders referred reporters to a memo released Sunday in which Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor who interrogated Ford on behalf of Senate Republicans, summarized Ford’s testimony. “Each of the things that he called out were things that were laid out in that memo,” said Sanders.
        
          The press says these arguments miss the point. What matters, reporters argue, is Trump’s tone. “You said he was stating the facts,” a reporter told Sanders at the White House briefing. “But this was so much more than stating the facts. This was a full-scale campaign-rally assault on a woman who says she’s a victim of sexual assault.”
        
          Yes, Trump’s mockery of Ford was contemptible. But let’s not lose sight of the fundamental dishonesty of his remarks. What he said at that rally wasn’t more than stating the facts. It was less. It was full of lies.
        
          Ford doesn’t recall exactly when the alleged assault happened or how she got there. She has described the interior of the house, but she doesn’t recall whose house it was. That much is true. But the rest of Trump’s riff was sheer fabrication. It misrepresented Ford’s testimony, Kavanaugh’s testimony, and Mitchell’s memo.
        
          Start with Trump’s claim that Ford said she didn’t know in “what neighborhood” the attack occurred. In her testimony, Ford described the location as “a house in the Bethesda area … somewhere between my house and the [Columbia] Country Club.” Kavanaugh, in his testimony, added the address: “Dr. Ford has said that this event occurred at a house near Columbia Country Club, which is at the corner of Connecticut Avenue in the East-West Highway in Chevy Chase, Maryland.” Mitchell’s memo repeated Ford’s description.
        
          You could argue that when Trump joked about Ford not knowing the neighborhood, he was using a strict definition of neighborhood. But that would be absurdly generous, especially after Kavanaugh specified an intersection. Let’s be real: The reason Trump made the joke is that he didn’t pay attention to Kavanaugh’s testimony, Ford’s testimony, or Mitchell’s memo. He just made it up.
        
          Trump’s next line was about where in the house the attack occurred: “ ‘Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ” Here, there’s no interpretation that can rescue the president’s lie. In her initial letter, her interview with the Washington Post, and her testimony, Ford explicitly said the attack happened upstairs. Mitchell, in her memo, repeated that point. Anyone who has paid attention to Ford’s story, sympathetically or skeptically, knows that the upstairs/downstairs distinction is central to her description of the attack and to witness testimony for or against her. There are only two possible explanations for Trump joking that she didn’t know on which level the attack took place. One is that he didn’t read the memo or watch the testimony. The other is that he doesn’t care.
        
          Trump’s last line—“I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember”—is false on its face. It’s a dismissal of everything Ford recalled in her testimony. It’s also a brushoff of Mitchell’s memo.
        
          So when Graham says “everything [Trump] said was factual,” he’s lying. When Sanders says Trump’s riff “wasn’t anything other than the president stating facts,” she’s lying. When Sanders says “each of the things that he called out were things that were laid out in [Mitchell’s] memo,” she’s lying again. And when Conway says Trump was just “pointing out factual inconsistencies,” she’s lying, too. Nothing Trump cited in his riff was an inconsistency. Everything he said was either a fabrication or a caricature of vagueness in Ford’s testimony.
        
          It’s true that Ford can’t recall important details about place and time. It’s true that she can’t recall how she got to the house or how she left. It’s true that every accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence. But Trump’s portrayal of Ford’s testimony wasn’t true. It was a pack of lies. And people who defend it, like Lindsey Graham, are liars too.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/rachel-mitchell-christine-blasey-ford-report.html,"
          When prosecutor Rachel Mitchell was hired by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct the questioning of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager, it seemed odd.
        
          As a state prosecutor for three years and a federal prosecutor for 25 more, I knew that job to be about holding a person who committed a crime accountable and finding the truth. But that was not Mitchell’s job last week. Her job was to attempt to dent a victim’s credibility and serve as a “female assistant” cut-out for the all-male, all-white Republican side of the committee.
        
          By most impressions, Mitchell failed to do any significant damage to Ford’s account of events during Thursday’s Senate testimony. In an apparent effort to change that perception, Mitchell issued a report on Sunday that was addressed not to the full Judiciary Committee, or to the Senate at large, but instead to “All Republican Senators.”
        
          In her report, Mitchell does what no prosecutor should do—she attempts to discredit the victim of a sexual assault. Her effort is so misleading, it approaches farce. Mitchell begins her offensive by falsely claiming that Ford “struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name.” She relies on the fact that notes from a 2012 therapy session, when Ford disclosed that she was sexually assaulted, did not include his name.
        
          What Mitchell fails to mention is that Ford told her therapist that her attacker was “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and a high-ranking member of society in Washington.” Ford’s description fits Brett Kavanaugh to a T. More importantly, an “experienced sex crimes prosecutor” like Mitchell should understand that Ford may have done what many sexual assault victims do—made a considered decision not to identify her attacker by name. Later in 2012, Ford told her husband that Brett Kavanaugh was the person who had assaulted her.
        
          Next, Mitchell falsely claims that Ford “changed her description of the incident.” The “change” that Mitchell says undermines Ford’s credibility was Ford having once described the Kavanaugh incident as “sexual assault” and once as “physical abuse.” Would you call a witness a liar because he recounted an event by once saying he was going to his “house” and once saying he was going to his “home?” This is what Mitchell seeks to do.
        
          Her next allegation is that Ford does not remember “key details of the night in question.” Details like who invited her to the party, how she got there, and what method of transportation she used to get home.
        
          As Ford describes the assault, Kavanaugh forced her into a bedroom, covered her mouth when she tried to scream, and attempted to remove her clothes so he could rape her. In the context of an attempted rape, who invited Ford to the party hardly seems like a “key” event. And any prosecutor who deals with victims of crimes knows that the mind often recalls the trauma itself, leaving the insignificant details blurred in its wake.
        
          In her next line of attack, Mitchell claims that the other people at the party where the alleged assault occurred do not support Ford’s version of events. Ford has identified at least three other people at the party. Ford has said that two of the people, Leland Keyser and Patrick Smyth, would have had no idea the assault occurred because they were on a different floor of the house and would not have been able to see or hear the assault. From their perspective, there was nothing that would distinguish that party from any of the countless other parties they may have attended in their teens.
        
          Mitchell includes part of a statement from Keyser in her report, but she edits out the part where Keyser says that although she does not remember the specific party from 36 years ago, she believes Ford and thinks she is telling the truth.
        
          According to Ford’s description of events, the third person at the party, Mark Judge, was an eyewitness to the assault. In a written statement to the Judiciary Committee, Judge said both that he has no memory of, and never saw, the incident Ford describes.
        
          Witnesses often say “I don’t remember” when they do not want to provide evidence against a friend or family member. Even so, in his 1997 book Wasted, Judge acknowledged that he was frequently blackout drunk; Ford said that Judge and Kavanaugh were very drunk when the incident occurred.
        
          It is possible that Judge witnessed the assault but was too drunk to remember. However, that would be very different from Judge saying that he has a clear memory and is confident the assault did not take place. A prosecutor knows this distinction well, but it is missing in Mitchell’s assessment of the question.
        
          In addition to disparaging Ford’s memory of the sexual assault, Mitchell alleges that there is something defective with Ford’s memory of “important recent events.” Mitchell says that Ford cannot remember if she provided the Washington Post with a copy of her therapy notes or a summary of the therapy notes that she made after reviewing them.
        
          That’s it? Perhaps Mitchell should have asked Ford what she was wearing, or what she ate for breakfast, when she spoke with the Washington Post. If she did not remember those things, would it be additional proof that Ford was lying? No. And I have no doubt that in her 25 years as a sex crimes prosecutor, Mitchell has more than once argued to a jury that victims of sexual assault should not be disbelieved because they cannot remember every detail.
        
          During Thursday’s hearing, Mitchell asked Ford a seemingly endless series of questions about her fear of flying. Perhaps in an effort to justify what was widely criticized as a waste of time, Mitchell has included an analysis of Ford’s statement that she flies for work and vacation in her report. Mitchell’s report also makes the point that Ford’s hearing testimony was delayed because of Ford’s fear of flying. Both can be true. Someone can fear flying and yet still fly. And one can easily imagine that flying to a vacation destination would be less stressful than flying to testify before Congress about your sexual assault at the hands of a Supreme Court nominee, after the same members of Congress, and the president of the United States, have publicly called you a liar.
        
          Mitchell wraps up her efforts at undermining Ford by suggesting that Ford is not credible because on one occasion she said that Kavanaugh’s sexual assault “caused” her psychological problems, and on another occasion she said that the assault “contributed” to her psychological problems. Again: That’s it?
        
          In her report, Mitchell comes to a “bottom line” conclusion that “no reasonable prosecutor” would charge the case. That may be true based on what was presented, but Ford’s allegation had never been investigated by any law enforcement agency. No prosecutor would charge any case without a full investigation by law enforcement. Further, Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing is a job interview, not a trial. Mitchell’s conclusions, in absence of a full and thorough investigation, expose her as the Republican mouthpiece she was hired to be.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/ex-boyfriend-christine-blasey-ford-polygraph.html,"
          Senate Republicans, through less brash methods than the president’s, have ramped up their effort to discredit Christine Blasey Ford with a sworn statement from a man professing to be Ford’s former boyfriend and contradicting answers she gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          In the statement obtained by Fox News on Tuesday, the ex-boyfriend claims Ford had helped her close friend prepare for a polygraph test, despite Ford’s statement to the Judiciary Committee that she had never “given tips or advice” to anyone preparing to take a polygraph test.
        
          The redacted statement by the ex-boyfriend, who has remained anonymous, also claims that Ford had not, in the six years the two dated, expressed a fear of flying or of “closed quarters, tight spaces, or places with only one exit.”
        
          Ford stood by her testimony, and a source told Politico that she “is not going to get into a tit-for-tat.”
        
          The friend mentioned in the statement, Monica McLean, denied the polygraph claim. “I have NEVER had Christine Blasey Ford, or anybody else, prepare me, or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time,” she told Politico in response.
        
          The ex-boyfriend said he had dated Ford from 1992 to ’98, and he said he “found her truthful and maintain no animus towards her.” According to the New York Times, the ex-boyfriend is Brian Merrick, who said, in an article in the Wall Street Journal, that he met Ford while she was pursuing a master’s degree at Pepperdine University and found her “sweet, cute and with a good attitude.”
        
          He wrote in the letter that Ford had never mentioned Kavanaugh to him, which is consistent with her testimony that she did not tell anyone about the alleged assault until 2002. He told the Journal he found it odd Kavanaugh had not come up in their relationship, “but I would never try to discredit what she says or what she believes.”
        
          He also said he broke up with Ford when they were dating long-distance and he found out she had been “unfaithful” while she was living in Hawaii. He said she continued to use a credit card they shared nearly a year after the breakup. “When confronted, Dr. Ford said she did not use the card, but later admitted to the use after I threatened to involve fraud protection,” he said. He said they had not been in contact much since.
        
          The part of his statement that Kavanaugh supporters seized on related to an anecdote about McLean, whom he described as Ford’s “life-long best friend” and who was allegedly interviewing for a job with the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office at some point in the 1990s. “I witnessed Dr. Ford help McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam,” he wrote. “Dr. Ford explained in detail what to expect, how polygraphs worked and helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam. Dr. Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology.”
        
          Here is the exchange from the hearing between her and outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell that Kavanaugh supporters have pointed to as being potentially a lie:
        
          The second question, while not completely unrelated to the topic at hand, seemed strange at the time, and some speculated that she was setting Ford up for a perjury trap that was never triggered. It now appears Mitchell, who has since released a report aimed at discrediting Ford, knew something about the statement, or at least was guided to ask about Ford advising someone about a polygraph.
        
          Kavanaugh supporters on Wednesday promoted the story as evidence of Ford’s lack of credibility, and in a letter Tuesday evening, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley cited the statement and demanded Ford’s lawyers hand over therapist notes, recordings from the polygraph, communications with reporters, and other materials to assess her truthfulness, indicating he believed Ford had lied under oath to the committee about the polygraph test. “Your continued withholding of material evidence despite multiple requests is unacceptable,” he wrote.
        
          On Tuesday night, President Trump openly mocked Ford at a campaign rally, mimicking her inability to remember details about the party where she was allegedly assaulted.
        
          The FBI report on the allegations against Kavanaugh could be handed to the Senate committee as early as the end of Wednesday. Democrats have asked for a redacted version to be released to the public, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked for the FBI to brief the Senate on the report. Republican leaders have ignored these requests, according to Politico.

          Whether or not Trump’s mocking and misrepresentation of Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were part of a planned strategy, his rhetoric has quickly become the de facto talking points of the Republican Party and White House as the world awaits the FBI supplement background check on the Supreme Court nominee.
        
          “He’s pointing out factual inconsistencies. Do you have corroboration for her claims? Can you fill in her memory gaps, her factual inconsistencies?” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday outside the White House, after saying that Ford had been “treated like a Fabergé egg by all of us.”
        
          Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders parroted the point later in the day: “The president was stating the facts.”
        
          Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has emerged as one of Trump and Kavanaugh’s loudest defenders, said Wednesday at the Atlantic Festival: “President Trump went through a factual rendition, and I didn’t like it. I would tell him to knock it off—it’s not helpful.”*
        
          Trump’s comments Tuesday night go beyond “pointing out factual inconsistencies” in Ford’s story. While he dwelled on Ford’s admitted lapses in memory, like not knowing the exact house she was at during the alleged assault and how she got home, Trump also said that she didn’t know if she was upstairs or downstairs when the alleged assault happened—”Upstairs, downstairs, where was it? I don’t know, but I had one beer. That’s the only thing I remember.” This is false: She has always said that the attack took place in an upstairs bedroom, and there are plenty of other details she recalled consistently as well.
        
          While Senate Republicans made a big point of listening to Ford’s testimony and not directly challenging her during Thursday’s hearing itself, they raised questions about her reliability and memory both before and after the session. But they’ve also hinted that Trump’s comments are unwelcome. “There’s a lot of time expiration in memory here. I think it would have been better left unsaid,” Sen. Orrin Hatch told reporters, essentially backing up Trump’s claims while acknowledging that he probably shouldn’t have said them: “I wish he would just stay out of it.”
        
          Questioning Ford is not a new tack for Hatch: He was one of the earliest proponents of the mistaken identity theory so disastrously taken up by Kavanaugh’s friend and conservative judicial activist Ed Whelan.
        
          One group of Republicans hasn’t gone after Ford’s claims: the three who do not support Kavanaugh’s nomination (yet). Susan Collins told CNN on Wednesday that Trump’s comments about Ford “were just plain wrong.” Lisa Murkowski said they were “wholly inappropriate and entirely unacceptable.” Jeff Flake told NBC, “I wish he hadn’t done it, and I just say it’s kind of appalling.”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/republican-senators-tired-of-protesters-reporters.html,"
          Here’s a striking image:
        
          That’s the floor that Republican Maine Sen. Susan Collins’ office is on. Collins, of course, holds one of the key swing votes that will determine whether Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, and as such is of great interest to reporters/constituents/protesters at the moment. Her staffers say they didn’t tell Capitol Police to block such individuals from having access to the hallway above, but they also didn’t “contest” the decision. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell complained this morning about protesters “harassing” his “members” at airports, which was seemingly a reference to the two self-identified sexual assault survivors who approached Georgia Sen. David Perdue at D.C.’s Reagan National Airport; when one extended her arm to shake his hand, he told her not to touch him, then ducked into a men’s bathroom.
        
          Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, who was appointed to John McCain’s seat, is also sick of the badgering:
        
          It does seem like one option to avoid being harassed and targeted by vicious mobs consisting of, uh, two sexual-assault survivors, would be to not insist on confirming an individual who faces multiple credible allegations of sexual assault to the Supreme Court. Just a thought!

          GoFundMe, the popular website that monetizes public sympathy, is full of campaigns for both Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. The Ford pages are heartening—well, except for how critics have used them to imply that Ford made her accusations to score big donations from loose-hearted liberal strangers. But if you live in a lefty online bubble, like I do, the Kavanaugh pages are disturbing and fascinating counterweights. Why would anyone want to give more money to a federal judge and graduate of Georgetown Prep, Yale, and Yale Law, who has worked with power brokers and socialized with country clubbers all of his life?
        
          There are some funny things going on here. One campaign, started on Tuesday, proposes to use its $100,000 goal to “brew a KPA: a Kavanaugh Pale Ale,” an effort to “show the world that enjoying beer doesn’t make someone a criminal.” The appeal ends with an exhortation: “Renate Brewius!” Just another heartfelt expression of respect for Renate Schroeder Dolphin, no doubt. Another page straight-up copied the most popular fundraiser’s intro text (I hear this is not uncommon in GoFundMe world).
        
          That popular campaign, the most funded by far, comes from John Hawkins.Hawkins, who runs the website Right Wing News, writes articles with headlines like “Diversity Is a Weakness, Not a Strength,” “The 6 Big Ways Liberals Are Destroying America’s Culture,” and “There Are No Oppressed People in America.” His campaign—for “a good man who has been treated very, very badly”—is currently funded at more than $500,000 and climbing.
        
          Hawkins has updated his campaign’s introductory text eight times, and those updates tell quite a story. He’s self-consciously transparent about his failed efforts to reach Kavanaugh “via multiple sources including his office and his lawyer.” “He may just have too much going on right now to deal with this and we may not get an answer until after the vote,” Hawkins writes.  Multiple times, Hawkins offers his personal contact information for anyone skeptical he will get the money to Kavanaugh.
        
          But the most interesting update, to me, is the first one. “I have heard some people say that Brett Kavanaugh is rich and so his family doesn’t need the money,” Hawkins writes. “That’s actually not correct”—and here he links to a MarketWatch post on Kavanaugh, titled “Brett Kavanaugh May Become the ‘Poorest’ Supreme Court Justice.”
        
          To his credit, Hawkins retained the quotation marks around “poorest.” Compared with the average American, Kavanaugh earns plenty: His family’s yearly income is about four times the median household income in the United States. But it’s worth recalling that the judge’s finances—given his salary and his age—should be in better shape than they are. In another post on MarketWatch, which dates to July, economics writer Tim Mullaney reported that Kavanaugh’s financial disclosure report “left personal-finance mavens scratching their heads.” Why would the judge have only $15,000 to $50,000 in savings, no investments, and a small 401(k)? “He’s miles behind where a normal person’s finances should be at 53,” Mullaney wrote. Then there are those mysterious vanishing credit-card debts and that odd down payment for his Chevy Chase, Maryland, house, which seemed to come out of the ether and may have been from his parents or in-laws (in which case, he’s not obligated to report the help). “The White House has worked hard to frame Kavanaugh as a mainstream fellow,” Stephanie Mencimer wrote in Mother Jones. “Publicly disclosing the extent to which his parents or in-laws may be subsidizing his high-end lifestyle could probably undermine that portrayal.”
        
          These financial irregularities, the forgotten controversy of Kavanaugh’s nomination, now haunt Hawkins’ GoFundMe, where commenters are battling it out about whether Kavanaugh and his family merit their financial sympathy. (Well, they were battling it out, until Hawkins closed the page’s comments because of “horrible human beings smearing the judge and saying grotesque things”; see update No. 8.) There are naysayers, full of sarcasm. User Timothy wrote: “The poor guy makes only $220,600 a year! I feel so sorry for him.” User Brian added: “We need to make sure to keep this rich family rich. These donations are amazing.” User Julia: “Wow, a charity for millionaires. Fascinating.” Others argued that Kavanaugh’s wealth was, in the scheme of things, really nothing. User Cathy wrote: “1 mill house these days is like a 30K house when I was young. 1 mill is nothing really in income. Inflation to be rich you have to have far more than 1 million in these times. He is a humble man plain and simple.”
        
          Then there are the saddest comments in the world—nominally supportive but so tragic as to make one want to burn everything down. On GoFundMe pages, it’s not uncommon for people to comment with requests for readers to visit their own campaigns. It’s a practice that risks opprobrium from fellow commenters; perhaps for this reason, the people reframing Kavanaugh’s plight in relationship to their own did it in a roundabout way. “This would be great for one to get this much money,” user Catherine commented. “My daughter is in liver failur[e] and have done good making it to 500 in about 20 days. Great for his family to have so many on his side.” User Candace wrote: “Unable to donate disabled on fixed income can’t even afford to fix my vehicle. I have a GoFundMe page but no donations on it…I pray this family gets justice I’m sick of the SJW feminazis terrorizing people and destroying property. They are like rabid animals.”
        
          Much of users’ sympathy for the judge’s financial woes seems to come from the perception that, after this event, he will be utterly ruined—and that the forces arrayed against him are devious and deeply funded. Another campaign, run by Richard Mitchell, the editor in chief of Conservative Daily News, had only $6,380 raised as of Wednesday. But it captured the sentiment. “Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an amazing human being, fantastic dad, great husband, respected Jurist, and heralded member of his community,” Mitchell writes. “Defending his good name against George Soros-funded groups will be expensive.”
        
          Although the judge didn’t mention Soros by name when he spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the idea that Soros has funded Kavanaugh’s accusers is everywhere. It’s the ugliest face of the “Democratic revenge” conspiracy theory that Kavanaugh himself helped stoke at the hearings. This is how people who seem to have so little could have sympathy for a man with so much. If you believe that #MeToo has infinite power, and that the left wing is funding the movement with its gobs of money, Kavanaugh’s privileged position in American life is going to look small in comparison. This is how a D.C. insider with elite credentials can show up on a platform that usually raises money for uninsured people’s medical bills. Poor little rich judge!

          Of all the things that have torn the country apart since we began our national experiment in governance by rotten pumpkin, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court might be the worst. For most of the country, Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony was searing, credible, and horrifying; for a significant minority, it was stand-up fodder. We know how this will play out, whether Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not: Eventually, people will stop talking about whether or not they believe Ford’s allegations without ever agreeing on a shared set of facts. That’s no way to hold a nation together, but since it’s a foregone conclusion that no evidence would convince Republicans to drop Kavanaugh, it doesn’t seem avoidable. Unless, that is, we adapt this brilliant plan from The Daily Show’s Mike Kosta, and get Kavanaugh completely and utterly shitfaced:
        
          Kosta’s legal theories aside—we’re pretty sure that “Sober Brett” is still legally responsible for “Drunk Brett’s” actions—this is absolutely right, and absolutely genius:
        
          In retrospect, it’s amazing no one thought of this sooner. There was no way we were gonna make it out of this unscheduled deep dive into 1980s fraternity culture without a good old-fashioned, sticky-floored keg party. And who knows, maybe a Chug-a-Lug House-style Bacchanalian on the floor of the Senate would help heal some of the country’s divisions; at this point, it’s not like it could make things any worse. So let’s pop our collars, crank up the Kenny Loggins, and wait for the credits to roll. They surely won’t be long now.

          During a rally Tuesday night in Southaven, Mississippi, President Donald Trump dramatically changed course and, after days of being restrained in his response to Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations, mocked her Senate testimony outlining an alleged sexual assault at the hands of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Before a partisan crowd, Trump put on an affected voice and dismissed and attempted to discredit Ford’s accusation by highlighting the gaps in her memory about the evening, now, 30-plus years later.
        
          Here’s Trump on the stump:

          As the FBI investigates sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Americans are getting a fuller picture of Kavanaugh’s conduct in high school. On Tuesday, the New York Times added to the composite of Kavanaugh as a young man, including a 1983 letter written by Kavanaugh to seven of his friends at Georgetown Prep about a weeklong trip to Ocean City, Maryland, an end-of-the-year pilgrimage made by many prep school students in the greater Washington area.
        
          In the handwritten letter organizing logistics of the house rental for the friend group, Kavanaugh jokingly made references to heavy drinking and possible eviction from the rented house if they didn’t keep things under control. “It would probably be a good idea […] to warn the neighbors that we’re loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us. Advise them to go about 30 miles,” Kavanaugh quipped. “The danger of eviction is great and that would suck because of the money and because this week has big potential. (Interpret as wish.)”
        
          The Times story adds to the growing body of information about Kavanaugh’s time at Georgetown Prep. “Recent interviews with more than a dozen classmates and friends from that time depict Judge Kavanaugh as a member of a small clique of football players who dominated Georgetown Prep’s work-hard, play-hard culture,” the Times reports. “His circle celebrated a culture of heavy drinking, even by the standards of that era.” The emphasis on Kavanaugh’s drinking habits has come to the forefront because of the judge’s denial of heavy drinking during his Senate testimony, a characterization that has been refuted by a number of former classmates and acquaintances.
        
          “One night during his senior year, according to classmates who witnessed it, Judge Kavanaugh triumphantly hoisted an empty beer keg above his head, in recognition that he and his friends were well on their way to reaching their goal of polishing off 100 kegs during the academic year—an achievement they later boasted about in their yearbook,” the Times reports. “Four Georgetown Prep classmates said they saw Judge Kavanaugh and his friends partake in binge-drinking rituals many weekends in which other partygoers saw them inebriated, even having difficulty standing.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-ub40-concert-yale-gregory-magarian-bar-fight.html,"
          On Monday, news broke that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in a bar fight after a UB40 concert in 1985, when he was a junior at Yale. Kavanaugh and his friends—including future NBA player and unlikely character witness Chris Dudley—went to a local bar called Demery’s, where they mistook another patron for UB40’s lead singer Ali Campbell. According to the police report, words were exchanged, then ice, then Dudley allegedly smashed a glass into the hapless Ali Campbell doppelgänger’s head, sending him to the hospital. (Dudley, who was arrested after the incident, denied this to police, while Kavanaugh refused to say whether or not he threw the ice.)
        
          The incident raises many fascinating questions about the future of the Supreme Court, the elite prep-school-to-Ivy-to-power pipeline, and Kavanaugh’s misleading testimony about his drinking. But with all the hullaballoo in Washington, we risk losing sight of the most important question of all: How was the UB40 concert?
        
          To find out more, I spoke to professor Gregory Magarian, who teaches constitutional law at Washington University in St. Louis. Although he did not know Brett Kavanaugh during his time at Yale, Magarian is eminently qualified to discuss his suitability for the Supreme Court: Not only did he clerk for John Paul Stevens, he also headed an American Bar Association reading group that helped evaluate Elena Kagan’s legal writings when she was nominated to replace Stevens. But his single most important qualification is that on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 1985, Magarian shelled out $15.50 for a ticket to the UB40 concert at New Haven’s Palace Theatre.
        
          Magarian’s feelings about the UB40 show are well-documented, although the concert itself is not. The Friday after the show, the Yale Daily News ran a negative review by Paul Muenzen in the “After Hours” pull-out section. That particular issue is missing from Yale’s digital collection, and Muenzen, who has since become a Buddhist monk and now goes by the name Hyon Gak Sunim, did not respond to a request for comment. But it’s possible to reconstruct parts of his lost review from a letter Magarian wrote to the Yale Daily News after reading it. Muenzen apparently thought UB40 had no business singing about poverty now that they’d made it, as this quote Magarian pulled from Muenzen’s review shows:
        
          But Muenzen didn’t like UB40’s big pop hits either, leading Magarian to ask what was left:
        
          I spoke to Magarian by phone on Tuesday and discussed his memories of seeing UB40 in 1985. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
        
          Matthew Dessem: The first thing I noticed is that the letter that you wrote is full of UB40 facts. Were you a fan before the show? What’s your musical background?
        
          Gregory Magarian: I’m a lifelong music nerd, and actually, in that time, starting late in high school—this is my first month of college. My dad was a newspaper guy, so I had been writing record reviews, and maybe by that time some concert reviews for the Milwaukee Journal as a freelancer. So I was a music nerd, and I wrote some about music. And so this was my most comfortable idiom, to sort of geek out about this stuff. But I was definitely a fan of UB40 for a few years, which at that point in my life was a long time. Enjoyed their music very much.
        
          You mentioned it was your first month—that’s such a fluid social environment. Do you remember how or when you decided to go to that concert or who you went with? Buying tickets?
        
          Well, actually, it’s the only time in my life, other than a few times when I was on assignment for the Journal, that I ever went to a concert alone. It just, in my first month, I believe, I’d have to check the calendar, but my recollection is it was a weeknight. And I just didn’t know anybody yet who wanted to go.
        
          Yeah, it was a Wednesday.
        
          Yeah. So I didn’t know anybody who wanted to go. I’m sure I asked around, my roommates, and nobody was interested, so I just said the hell with it. I really loved a lot of music, but I certainly was a good-sized UB40 fan, and so, “I never got to see this band, I’ve got a chance to see them now, the hell with it, I’m just going to go.” If I remember correctly, this theater was a bit of a schlepp from my residential college, and so I probably just went on the night of the show and got a ticket at the box office.
        
          That’s a sort of classic freshman year decision, too, “I’m going to this concert by myself!”
        
          It totally is. That’s why I remember this reasonably well, because it was one of those moments where it’s like, “Wow, I’m in college. I’m going to a concert alone. This kind of sucks, but it’s kind of cool.”
        
          Did you have a seat or was it general admission? What was it like in the venue?
        
          I believe I had a seat. I don’t know if that venue is still there, but it was a theater venue, it wasn’t like a club setting. Probably one of those shows where you’ve got assigned seats, and then when the music starts people were standing.
        
          Did you run into anybody else that you knew from Yale there? I mean that wouldn’t have been many people, I guess, at that point freshman year. 
        
          It wasn’t many people! If I did, I don’t remember. It’s not impossible that I would have, but I don’t have any recollection of seeing anybody else.
        
          Let me remind you, you’re not under oath.
        
          No, I mean it’s a really interesting exercise in light of—there are so many layers of irony to this, one of them being that I’m a constitutional law professor, and I clerked on the Supreme Court, so the fact that I’m getting calls about Brett Kavanaugh to talk about something I wrote in the Yale Daily News about UB40 is sublimely weird. And the other thing about this is that it’s an exercise in the incompleteness of memory, which is obviously a really important theme in this whole story as well. But you’re quite right, I really didn’t know that many people. And so it would have been unlikely that I would have run into anyone I knew.
        
          Did you know Brett Kavanaugh, by chance?
        
          I don’t remember him at all. But I remember that when I became aware of him in public life, the name seemed familiar. I overlapped with him for two years, but based on everything that we are learning about him, there’s almost no conceivable social circle where I would have run into him, unless maybe there’s a little bit of time when I did some debating at the Yale Political Union, he might have been involved in that, so I might have been aware of him there. But I don’t remember ever meeting him.
        
          Did you notice anyone being disruptive at the UB40 concert?
        
          You know, to the extent—that seems like something I might remember, and no. I just remember it as, other than being by myself, a pretty ordinary concertgoing experience.
        
          One thing that Muenzen wrote in his review that you agreed with him about was that there were a surprising number of teenage girls there. What was the crowd like, was that a striking thing?
        
          Honestly, I don’t have a primary memory of this. But it sounds from the context—I reread the thing I wrote—it sounds like somewhere in the review, he said, “Oh, this is a band that caters to prepubescent girls.” And I was saying, “Yeah, there were a lot of prepubescent girls there, younger girls.” And that would make sense. This was at the point when that band was at the height of its popularity and had had some big hits. So it would have been sort of an MTV-age crowd, and I was a little bit beyond that. So I don’t have any memory of that, but that obviously made an impression on me, enough to write it.
        
          The opening band was a ska group from Los Angeles called the Untouchables. Did you know them? 
        
          The Untouchables! Oh yeah, yeah, I loved the Untouchables.
        
          I was going to say, you were a music writer, so…
        
          Yeah, I was. And I’m sure that that was an added inducement for me. Their first album, Wild Child, I think, would have been in ’84, ’85, they were terrific. That would have been a sweetener for me, I like them a lot too.
        
          Reviews of other shows on that tour say that one of the problems was that there was such a difference in energy between the Untouchables and UB40, with the Untouchables being really energetic and UB40 being laid-back reggae. Was that your experience?
        
          That sounds right. And I’ve been trying to see if I can get any kind of sense [or] impression in my head of the bands, and I don’t have much but the Untouchables—exactly what you said, the Untouchables were a ska band and UB40 were a reggae band. And I’ve continued to love both of those styles of music my whole life, and that’s entirely predictable. Some of the most frenetic concerts I’ve ever seen have been the handful of ska shows I’ve seen. This band called Fishbone that I saw a couple years later in college just went completely berserk on stage. And this was a bigger venue. So for the Untouchables it would have been a challenge in a venue that size to put the energy over. I think they did, based on what little I can remember. So UB40 would have come out, and they’re still in a big auditorium, and they’re sort of just grooving along in more of a roots/reggae vein. But from my standpoint, that’s great, ’cause I know both of those bands, I know what I’m getting with both of them. It is kind of weird for the opener to be high energy and for the headliner to be more in a mellow groove. But if you like all the music, it’s all good.
        
          So that UB40 tour was to support Geffery Morgan, which was—their big hits were from Labour of Love, a covers album. Do you remember anything about what they played, if you thought it was a good mix of old and new?
        
          You know, I was looking, and again, I’m getting this memory from the review, I would love to be able to get a setlist from that show. UB40 had sort of, in my sense, three distinct periods in their career. There was the sort of pre-Labour of Love era, when they were in a very dubby vein, more murky sound and more political sounds. And then their sort of pop heyday, which was Labour of Love and Geffery Morgan and a couple of the next albums, Rat in the Kitchen and UB40. And then, after that, they went off the pop deep end and really did start to suck, in kind of the way it sounds like this reviewer was saying they did. So I just think he was premature. But for me, in retrospect, this was the best possible moment to see them. Because they’d just had these two big hit albums, but they were still playing—I think I mentioned “One in Ten.” They had an EP called Little Baggariddim that had a duet with Chrissie Hynde* on “I Got You Babe,” and that was a big hit. But they had a remix of “One in Ten” on there. So I know that they would have played “One in Ten.” And I’m sure that they were still playing some of the things that had been hits off their earlier albums. So it would have been that mix, I’m sure of that.
        
          Do you have any memory of the mood of the show?
        
          My main recollection is I’m sure I was pretty far back, because I wouldn’t have gotten an expensive ticket, and I’m sure I got my ticket on the day of the show. I would have experienced it as, it’s a big venue—a theater, an auditorium show is always a little bit distant. And I don’t have any specific memory of how the audience reacted—that reference to prepubescent girls is the most interesting thing, because even in my subsequent experience, I see a lot of shows, but not a lot of shows with teenagers. I took my daughter to a Taylor Swift show a few years ago, and that was different, that was really interesting. So it sounds like my experience of this was probably, “Wow, some screaming teeny-boppers! And obviously, there are a bunch of college students around here and I don’t know them.” I was probably a little bit focused on the singularity of the experience, of being at the show by myself. On one hand, I would have been just completely focused on the music, and on the other hand it might have felt slightly awkward, socially, and I might have cocooned a bit mentally. I’m not looking for people I know because I don’t know anybody, because I couldn’t find anyone to go to the show with me. So I’m probably not focused on, “Gee, I wonder how many fellow Yale students are here.”
        
          And also you’d done that professionally or semiprofessionally, written about shows, right?
        
          Yeah. So it was very easy for me just to sort of sink into the music and enjoy it for what I was expecting. And I think the show was what I was expecting. Like I said, I knew both bands and I knew what their styles were. I think I came away very satisfied.
        
          Do you remember what you did after the show?
        
          Probably just went back to my room. This is a funny thing to document in the context of all the things Kavanaugh’s been saying: I don’t drink. I’m very much a left-wing guy, but I basically have the personal life of a Mormon. So I wouldn’t have gone out after the show because I wouldn’t have had any place to go. The people I knew were back home, and I’m kind of a homebody anyway. So probably I would have had class work to do, that I would have put off a little bit, which would have been uncommon for me, because I was going to a show on a Wednesday night. So I would have gone home and done anything that I’d left undone to prepare for class the next day.
        
          So you didn’t run into UB40’s lead singer out around New Haven?
        
          I did not run into the lead singer, or his unfortunate nondoppelgänger, or Brett Kavanaugh. I mean, the bar that they went to, Demery’s had a little bit of a reputation for being sort of a, not a place where fights were breaking out every night but more of a rough place. Not a happy little cheery student bar, but a little bit more boisterous.
        
          I did notice that Demery’s had—some bars have ads in the Yale Daily News, but they don’t. They’re in the list of campus events. And that night was Senior Night and they had free hors d’oeuvres. I guess if you didn’t drink, you might not have been there much.
        
          No. I don’t think I ever went.
        
          Well, it says “hors d’oeuvres,” it’s not, like, “Free Food!” it’s “hors d’oeuvres.” So I was wondering what those might have been, if you had any idea.
        
          Oh, God, I have no idea. What’s funny, the striking thing about that is everything fits. Like the fact that they wouldn’t have had ads—again, it’s kind of, by New Haven and Yale campus standards, a little bit of a rougher place. But it’s still Yale, and so the rough place is serving hors d’oeuvres rather than, I don’t know, free nachos or something, which is kind of amusing. But no, I couldn’t be sure, but I doubt I ever set foot in Demery’s.
        
          Is there anything else you remember about that show or that night? Or Brett Kavanaugh, for that matter?
        
          Nothing else. I’ve been pondering it, and it’s a pleasant but distant memory.
        
          Well, break out your old UB40 records. 
        
          I think I may.

          On Friday, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake was confronted in an elevator by Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher. What happened next went viral, in part because it seems to have been a contributing factor to Flake insisting on an FBI investigation, but also because it was an emotional and compelling interaction. The women, who identify as sexual assault survivors, held the door and held him to account. One thing that stuck out specifically to me was when Archila said, “The way that justice works is that you recognize hurt, you take responsibility for it, and then you begin to repair it.” Referring to Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh’s other accusers, she told Flake that he was wrong to vote for a man who “is unwilling to take responsibility for his own actions, unwilling to hold the harm he has done to one woman, actually three women, and repair it.”
        
          This part of the encounter has received little coverage, perhaps because the media has not known what to make of it. Archila was speaking in terms that are likely foreign to many: She was speaking the language of restorative justice. Our Anglo-American legal system is about affixing guilt and meting out punishment. By contrast, restorative justice is about addressing harm in a way that heals victims, offenders, and communities that have been torn apart. It is about reparation. Its face-to-face open dialogue process focuses on personal accountability; the victim and offender share deeply personal experiences with the least likely person in the world—each other. They decide together how they will move forward. It is a reckoning of a different sort than the cage match Americans are accustomed to.
        
          As I watched the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings I found myself thinking, what if? What if, instead of using our clearly broken and highly politicized process to assess these claims, the parties had been offered a restorative justice process? Both Ford and Kavanaugh spoke openly—and in Kavanaugh’s case, ragefully—of the personal hell they had experienced and the tremendous pain inflicted upon their families. But the hearing was not, as advertised, about “getting to the truth.” Indeed, the politicized process wasn’t even a reasonable example of how America’s justice system is supposed to work. Some members of the judiciary committee used Ford and Kavanaugh’s anguish to score political points and make headlines for themselves. Rather than providing a resolution, it sowed outrage and confusion. In the process, the harm described by Ford and Kavanaugh spread to millions of people who watched the hearings and found themselves in tears as they listened to both sides and relived their own traumas.
        
          Imagine how differently it might have played out if Ford and Kavanaugh had met in a private room with a trained facilitator instead of making separate appearances under the klieg lights of a nationally televised hearing that many saw as a kangaroo court. In a restorative justice process, Ford could have asked Kavanaugh questions; she could have described the particulars of her suffering, how she had come to this point in her life, and what she needed to move forward.
        
          Kavanaugh could have asked his own questions, and at the same time, he could have faced up to what many perceive to be established facts—his pattern of drunk, boorish behavior as a teenager. Digging deeper, he might have finally been able to move past his flat, repetitive denials and, as Archila suggested, “hold the harm he has done.” In this process, they—and we—could have moved away from a world of sides: innocent and guilty, winner and loser. Survivors of sexual assault might have finally received some real justice, and seen some real recognition and grappling. Those who perpetrate sexual misconduct might have realized there was a way to be held accountable without being sent into permanent exile.
        
          There has been a heated debate about whether Kavanaugh should be punished for what he may or may not have done as a teenager. But I agree with Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern that the real question, in judging Kavanaugh’s fitness and character for a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court, is whether he is willing to come to grips with his past conduct and show remorse and insight. A person who is willing to reflect and change is qualitatively different than someone who is not. A restorative justice process would have offered Kavanaugh that chance to show us—and Ford—whether he was up to doing that difficult, humbling work.
        
          Of course, this will never happen. In America, we adhere firmly to our adversarial model and to our vision of “winners and losers,” no matter how ill-suited to the dispute. It is the language of our playgrounds, our sports teams, and our politics. It is the language favored by our current president.
        
          So we will lurch forward, continuing to flail and inflicting more damage. With the FBI’s investigation in its infancy, the news cycle is already consumed by finger-pointing, accusations, and counterpunches as politicians and pundits fight over procedures and parameters. It is hard to envision an outcome that will be anything other than unsatisfying and infuriating to many if not most of us. Kavanaugh may ascend to the nation’s highest court or see his nomination derailed and defeated. Either way, he is unlikely to engage in the crucial self-examination that comes with true accountability. Ford will go back to her life in California without a dialogue with the one person she needed most to understand her pain, and so in a fundamental sense, she will not have been afforded the opportunity to have been heard or healed. Whatever the outcome, there will be no real reckoning for them or the rest of us. And we will all be the worse for it.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/aclu-jcn-kavanaugh-manchin-capito-sullivan-gardner.html,"
          The available evidence says that Brett Kavanugh’s confirmation now rests with just three Republican senators: Arizona’s Jeff Flake, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, and Maine’s Susan Collins, all of whom joined forces last week to demand the GOP give the FBI a week to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans hold a narrow 51–49 advantage—with Vice President Mike Pence in their back pocket as the potential tiebreaker—so they can’t afford to lose more than one of those three and still confirm Kavanaugh along party lines.
        
          And yet as the Senate waits for the FBI report, it’s noteworthy that Flake, Murkowski, and Collins aren’t the only senators being targeted by heavy-spending outside groups pressuring them to vote one way or the other on Kavanaugh. A half-dozen other senators have also found themselves the subject of at least one big-dollar ad blitz announced in the past two days alone.
        
          The American Civil Liberties Union, which is opposing Kavanaugh, unveiled a $1 million campaign on Monday with a target list that includes Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Republicans Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.
        
          And then on Tuesday, the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has reportedly already spent more than $10 million supporting Kavanaugh, announced its own plan for another $400,000 in advertising to keep the pressure on Manchin and fellow red-state Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both of whom voted to confirm Donald Trump’s previous SCOTUS pick, Neil Gorsuch, and both of whom are up for re-election in states Trump won in landslides.
        
          So what, exactly, is going on here? Are there really that many senators who could be the deciding vote for whether Kavanaugh is confirmed?
        
          Barring a major surprise in the FBI’s findings, the answer is almost certainly not. If the GOP ends up with the votes to confirm Kavanaugh along party lines, it’s possible that Heitkamp and/or more likely Manchin break ranks to prove their independence to Trump voters back home, but it’s nearly unthinkable either would be willing to be the deciding vote on their own. (Manchin, for one, has already reportedly discussed voting as a bloc with the GOP trio.)
        
          Meanwhile, while the four other GOP senators on the ACLU’s list have claimed that they’ll wait until the investigation is done before they make up their minds, each has happily taken a back seat to Flake, Murkowski, and Collins. There’s no reason to suspect that’s going to change. Gardner is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, for instance, and Fischer is up for re-election in a dark-red state. (The ads targeting Capito and Sullivan, meanwhile, can be explained in part by the ACLU trying to get the most bang for their buck. If you’re going to pay for airtime in Alaska to reach Murkowski, you might as well make it a two-for-one by tacking on Sullivan’s name to the kicker.) Even if the FBI uncovers something more damning than the current allegations against Kavanaugh, no one expects any of the four to jump ship before Flake, Murkowski, and/or Collins do.
        
          Still, this 13th-hour ad blitz isn’t just about running up the score, or scoring a few early points ahead of 2020. There is safety in numbers in politics, and it would be far easier for Flake, Murkowski, and Collins to vote to confirm Kavanaugh if Manchin and Heitkamp are right there with them. (Likewise, it’d be easier for Heitkamp to vote for Kavanaugh if Manchin does, and vice versa.) On the flip side, voting against confirmation gets a little bit easier for the GOP trio in the unlikely event another Republican or two are willing to defect as well. Don’t expect any of these six senators to be the swing vote, then—but should any of them be willing to break with their party, that might help swing Flake, Murkowski, and Collins in one direction over another.

          Anthony Kennedy is worried about American democracy.
        
          “Perhaps we didn’t do too good a job teaching the importance of preserving democracy by an enlightened civic discourse,” said Kennedy on Friday, speaking to high-schoolers in his hometown of Sacramento, California. “In the first part of this century, we’re seeing the death and decline of democracy.”
        
          Kennedy didn’t mention Brett Kavanaugh in this address, but it’s difficult to imagine his concerns weren’t tied to the furor over President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill his seat on the Supreme Court, especially given Kennedy’s relationship to Kavanaugh, who clerked for the former Supreme Court justice early in his career.
        
          If Kennedy is thinking about the Kavanaugh nomination, that offers another reason to worry about its implications for our democratic discourse and institutions. But if the fight for Kavanaugh is a democracy destabilizing event, then it’s only the latest in a long series of democracy destabilizing events in the United States. As an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, Kennedy has played a significant part in that story. From Bush v. Gore to Citizens United to Trump v. Hawaii—where the court upheld the president’s transparent Muslim travel ban—Kennedy has been a key figure in America’s democratic backsliding. And against that backdrop, Kennedy’s concern is hollow.
        
          Kavanaugh’s nomination has put stress on an already-stressed democracy. Controversial from the start, multiple allegations of sexual assault have made his Supreme Court bid among the most toxic political conflicts in recent American memory. That toxicity increased on Thursday, after Kavanaugh’s startlingly angry testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Denying the account of his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh raged against a “calculated” political attack “orchestrated” by Democrats and “left-wing opposition groups” purportedly looking for “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.”
        
          Kavanaugh’s bullying performance had its intended effect. Republicans rallied to the Supreme Court nominee just as Democrats stood behind his accuser. Eighty-four percent of Republicans said they believed Kavanaugh, versus just 5 percent of Democrats, according to a Quinnipiac survey conducted in the days since the hearing. Likewise, 86 percent of Democrats believed Ford, versus just 10 percent of Republicans. (Independents broke 46–38 in favor of believing Ford versus Kavanaugh.)
        
          But as much as the Kavanaugh furor is corrosive, it’s not yet a serious threat to American democracy, even as it suggests dangerously high levels of cultural bitterness and partisan mistrust. Actual threats to American democracy range from voter suppression and unaccountable “dark money” to explicit efforts to engineer “minority rule” in Washington and racialized policymaking meant to burden historically disfavored minorities. The threat is voter purges aimed at black Americans and rigid gerrymandering meant to dilute the votes of Hispanics; it’s a campaign finance regime that gives anonymous holders of accumulated wealth the power to flood elections with untraceable cash; it’s a president trying to shape the institutions of government to serve the interests of him and his family. Some of these are recurring threats to American democracy—others are novel. But during his time on the Supreme Court, Anthony Kennedy has either worsened the problem or unleashed the danger outright.
        
          In 2010, Kennedy authored the court’s opinion in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, obliterating decades of campaign finance law and allowing unprecedented levels of outside spending in elections. Writing for a 5–4 majority that split the court along ideological lines, Kennedy affirmed the claimant’s view that businesses held the same free speech rights as individuals. “When government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought,” wrote Kennedy.
        
          Citizens United opened the door to “super PACs,” groups that can accept unlimited donations from individuals or corporations and spend them on behalf of candidates, provided they don’t coordinate with the actual campaigns. And although super PACs have disclosure requirements, donors have circumvented them by routing contributions through entities that don’t require disclosure, yielding a torrent of completely unaccountable money. We saw the results of this last year, when these donors threatened to close the spigot on Republican politicians if they didn’t pass their favored tax policies.
        
          In 2013, Kennedy joined the majority on Shelby County v. Holder, invalidating a section of the Voting Rights Act requiring states and localities with a history of voting discrimination to clear new election or voting laws with the federal government. The decision didn’t preclude “preclearance” but asked lawmakers to develop a new formula for determining its scope. Congress, held by Republicans since 2015, has yet to step forward. In the meantime, conservative lawmakers in states across the country have pushed restrictive laws for voter identification, placed new limits on voter registration, and slashed ballot access by closing precincts and polling places. These policies have burdened the groups the Voting Rights Act was meant to protect: the poor, the elderly, foreign-language speakers, and people of color. In states like North Carolina, where lawmakers were found to have targeted black voters with “almost surgical precision,” that was the point.
        
          If Citizens United has been an invaluable tool for the maintenance of entrenched wealth, Shelby County has been similarly vital for those who want to preserve a white voting majority in American politics. Republican lawmakers unwilling or unable to win blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, and other groups have used the leeway of Shelby County to institute voter purges and sharply gerrymander their electorates on racial lines. And the Supreme Court, with Kennedy in the majority, has affirmed those moves as well. Before retiring, Kennedy voted to uphold sweeping voter purges in Ohio and racial gerrymandering in Texas.
        
          On similar lines, Kennedy joined conservatives on the court in Trump v. Hawaii to uphold Trump’s “travel ban,” with a short concurrence urging federal officials to “adhere to constitutional guarantees” of freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, while simultaneously granting the administration power to restrict movement into the country in a way that clearly targeted a particular religion, as evidenced in part by the president’s statements of religious animus.
        
          This gets to the most galling aspect of Kennedy’s stated concern for American democracy. In the final paragraph of his concurrence, Kennedy looked forward to the future: “An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.” He then retired, leaving Donald Trump to name his replacement—the same Trump who operates in contempt of those constitutional liberties and seeks to degrade the nation’s democratic institutions, who defines citizenship in racial terms, and seeks to remove those who fall short, from undocumented migrants to legal residents and actual American citizens.
        
          Kennedy gave Trump, who faces criminal investigation for obstruction of justice and potentially other felonies, a chance to secure a favorable majority on the Supreme Court, one which may weigh in on that investigation. And Kennedy recommended a replacement, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, who proposed “temporary deferral of civil suits and criminal prosecutions and investigations” for sitting presidents in a 2009 law review article. Kennedy punctuated his brief for America’s democratic ideals by giving the president a path to legal impunity. And a Justice Kavanaugh who ruled for Trump in those circumstances would do tremendous damage to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, as well as our democracy.
        
          That prospect, of Kennedy’s chosen successor doing untold damage to the institution he served, would be a fitting capstone to Kennedy’s career. Eighteen years ago, Kavanaugh was working to win the White House for George W. Bush after a tight election and contested result in Florida. Kavanaugh worked on Bush’s legal team to halt a state-mandated recount and secure the crucial swing state for the Republican presidential nominee. That case went to the Supreme Court, where Kennedy joined a partisan majority of GOP nominees to end the recount and deliver the race to Bush, circumventing Florida law and the Florida Supreme Court. The court even put an asterisk over the decision, writing that “Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities.” This was a one-off that just happened to be decided by Republican appointees for the benefit of a Republican presidential candidate.
        
          Bush v. Gore tarnished both the new president, who only secured a sense of legitimacy in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and the Supreme Court itself. The court’s conservatives appeared nakedly political, willing to abandon judicial restraint when it conflicted with factional advantage.
        
          It’s evidence of irony in history that we see something similar in the present. In testimony challenging allegations of sexual assault, Brett Kavanaugh condemned the Democratic Party in harsh, belligerent terms, threatening retribution for the accusations. He spoke as a lifelong Republican operative, not as an impartial judge. Kavanaugh doesn’t need to rule for Trump to threaten the legitimacy of the court; at this point, his confirmation itself would spark a legitimacy crisis, as millions of Americans reject his presence on the basis of the allegations (which he addressed with misleading testimony) and his aggressive partisanship.
        
          The line from Bush v. Gore to Brett Kavanaugh should put Anthony Kennedy’s stated concern for American democracy—his fear that it has entered a cycle of “death and decline”—into its proper context. Kennedy had 30 years on the nation’s most powerful court to defend democracy—to build equitable institutions and shape a level playing field for discourse and deliberation. He did just the opposite. His legacy is a weakened democracy and a damaged Supreme Court.

          “It’s a very scary time for young men in America if you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of,” Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House as part of an impromptu defense of Brett Kavanaugh. “My whole life I’ve heard you’re innocent until proven guilty, but now you’re guilty until proven innocent.”
        
          This was not the first time Trump has used the allegations against Kavanaugh as a jumping off point for worrying about the broader effects of women being more willing to go public about their sexual abusers. In a press conference last week at the United Nations, Trump said that he had been accused of sexual misconduct several times, as have many of his friends and associates, and that this had affected how he viewed the allegations against Kavanaugh. “Well, it does impact my opinion, you know why? Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” Trump said. “So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting at home watching television.”
        
          And as he more succinctly put it Tuesday: “This is a very difficult time. What’s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of the Supreme Court justice. It really does.” On this, Trump and his feminist critics certainly agree.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/seth-meyers-looks-at-trumps-defense-of-kavanaugh-during-yesterdays-press-conference.html,"
          Late Night’s Seth Meyers takes a closer look at the press conference Trump held yesterday, in which he defended Brett Kavanaugh. After last week’s hearings, the Senate decided to allow for an independent FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee. Starting with stats, remarking that only 35 percent of Americans believe Kavanaugh, while only 34 percent agree with his nomination. The host is not surprised that the nominee is so unpopular—after all, “he looks like the kind of guy that yells at six-year-olds, you have to have a permit for this lemonade stand!”
        
          But during the press conference, which started discussing the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, several female reporters attempted to ask the President about Kavanaugh and, “he shot them down in super demeaning and sexist ways,” remarks Meyers. “It’s almost like he saw someone else getting attention for acting like a maniac on TV and thought, I can top that.” Then Trump went from questioning the credibility of one of the three of Kavanaugh’s accusers, to calling the press “loco” for treating him unfairly, to an unrelated rant about how he’s never had a drink in his life, asking the press, “Can you imagine if I had? What a mess I’d be.” Meyer thinks he’s “basically saying, if you think I’m an ashole now, imagine if I had a few beers.”
        
          After the decision to allow a one-week delay for the FBI investigation to take place, Senator Lindsey Graham seemed particularly upset that he’d be the one who would have to explain the situation to Trump. But Meyers doesn’t buy it, “you love being the Trump whisperer because it keeps you on the Sunday morning talking shows.” The host discusses the limited range of the investigation, which doesn’t include questioning the women accusing Kavanaugh, and compared it to “going on a trip to Paris and saying, I don’t want to see the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, or Notre Dame.”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-lies-guilt-just-security.html,"
          In the rush to send the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the full Senate for a vote, the Judiciary Committee’s chairman, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley allowed only hours, not even a full day, to assess Thursday’s testimony. Hardly anyone, not even President Donald Trump, could deny the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford’s gut-wrenching testimony. And what was plain to those who had been closely tracking publicly available information before the hearing is that Kavanaugh gave several false statements. Even friends and early endorsers, much to their horror, observed this. Some have chosen to remain publicly silent following Thursday’s hearing; others have not.
        
          By Friday morning, a systematic analysis of Kavanaugh’s testimony was still lacking. Nobody could perform such a task in so short a period of time. The surprise last-minute move by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, however, provided the breathing room for that kind of detailed examination to follow.
        
          But what question should such an examination hope to answer? The solemn inquiry of whether an individual should be placed on the Supreme Court involves, in significant part, a risk assessment. For example, if there were specific reasons to determine a real risk exists that a nominee has an ongoing substance abuse problem, then the nation could not entrust that person with life and death situations, including emergency requests that sometimes need to be handled in the middle of the night. Or if there were specific reasons to determine a serious risk existed that a nominee had recently engaged in morally depraved acts, then we as a nation could not entrust him or her to decide questions of right and wrong over the fate of the country. That is, if there were specific reasons to determine a real risk.
        
          That standard of probability is not designed to protect the rights of the nominee, to be sure: It is to safeguard the nation’s core interests by making every effort to guarantee the proper functions of the highest court in the land. It’s another way of describing the exercise as a job interview, not a criminal trial, with an understanding of the stakes. Think of it as a job interview with a very strict national security background check for a lifetime appointment in which removal from office, even if new information emerges, is almost inconceivable.
        
          How should this apply to the assessment of Kavanaugh? The question is not simply whether Kavanaugh engaged in sexual assault 36 years ago, nor whether he gave false testimony about it last week. If just the first or both of those were true, it would mean Kavanaugh dragged a victim of his sexual assault (and her family, and his) through an unfathomable re-traumatizing experience in front of the world. That would amount to nothing less than an unforgivable and morally depraved act—committed not over three decades ago but rather last week. What’s the probability this happened?
        
          Let’s turn to the evidence. Ford’s testimony is not just evidence, it is highly credible evidence. And Kavanaugh’s testimony contains several instances of false evidence.
        
          How much weight should you apply to Ford’s testimony alone? Rebecca Hamilton, an assistant professor at American University Washington College of Law, described it well:
        
          In addition to several indicia for credibility, Ford’s testimony is also corroborated to some extent by Kavanaugh’s own calendar, the dates of employment of his friend Mark Judge that summer, the yearbook entries of both young men at the time, and witnesses to their drunkenness.
        
          How should you assess Kavanaugh’s testimony? If you want to get to the ground truth, Nathan Robinson provides a near-definitive account. The article is over 10,000 words, and I highly recommend spending the time it takes to read every one of those words if you seek the truth and want to understand the scale of the Kavanaugh’s falsehoods big and small. It is the kind of meticulous analysis that was only possible with the benefit of time that Flake, intentionally or not, provided. Even more information has come to light since his article was published, but Robinson provides a sort of capsule summary of his analysis at the end:
        
          Some of these lies were so outrageous that even some conservative/Republican commentators seemed stunned. Former FBI Director James Comey made his views known implicitly in a tweet that quoted a standard jury instruction: “If a witness is shown knowingly to have testified falsely about any material matter, you have a right to distrust such witness’ other testimony and you may reject all the testimony of that witness.”
        
          Comey drew the line specifically to Kavanaugh. “Small lies matter, even about yearbooks,” he wrote. Something similar happened with Lawfare’s Ben Wittes, who had earlier (long before sexual allegations surfaced) admonished liberal critics, “One of the reasons to oppose him is not that he’s some kind of terrible person. He’s a thoroughly decent and honorable person.” But in the aftermath of the testimony, Wittes retweeted his friend Comey and added a caption stating, “Once upon a time, a judge I very much admired”—notice the past tense—signed a judicial opinion setting forth a similar principle of evidence, which Wittes added “has been haunting me all day.” That judicial opinion, which Wittes excerpted, affirmed “the well-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence – often strong evidence – of guilt.”
        
          How then to evaluate Kavanaugh’s lies? This is not just a question of the jury instructions and principles of evidence that Comey and Wittes cite. Even more damning in Kavanaugh’s case are that several lies—including about yearbook references to sexual conquest, whether real or not, and about high school and college alcohol consumption—don’t just go to the question of his overall truthfulness. Those lies relate directly and materially to the question whether he participated in sexual assault under the influence of alcohol.
        
          Unless some surprising exculpatory evidence for Kavanaugh emerges from the ongoing FBI investigation or other sources, he does not pass the standard for elevation to the Supreme Court.
        
          We have lost sight of so many things in this hyperpoliticized atmosphere. However we got to this point in the process—by hook or by crook—which can be investigated later, vital information has emerged and it now casts a dark shadow over Kavanaugh’s potential role on the Supreme Court. On Friday, conservative thought leader Bill Kristol wrote, “If I had to vote today, I think I’d be a No. … [G]iven where we are, wouldn’t a future Court with a different constitutionalist justice be healthier for the nation—and for constitutionalism?”
        
          The answer is a resounding yes, and perhaps Democrats should negotiate a fast consideration of another Supreme Court nominee to replace Kavanaugh and help bring the country back from this abyss.
        
          Where we’ve also lost perspective is how the question at hand has been framed. The allegations against Kavanaugh are so serious and credible, and the number of people who have directly contradicted his testimony are now so vast, that the central question cannot simply be whether he should be made an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but rather whether he should continue to serve on the bench at all. That’s not just because of what he may have done 36 years ago, but because of what he may have done over the past few weeks including to Ford and in providing testimony before the Senate.
        
          Whether he should remain on the bench turns on a different and more onerous standard of proof. And it should be answered by a thorough investigation with no artificial time limits. If more exculpatory evidence does not emerge in that process, however, then Kavanaugh is in deep trouble. The two strongest pieces of evidence that now weigh against him are Ford’s testimony and his own. “False exculpatory statements are evidence – often strong evidence – of guilt,” Kavanaugh once acknowledged in a judicial opinion. Those words have rightfully come back to haunt him.

          One of the individuals who has been recently vouching for Brett Kavanaugh’s character in the press is Chris Dudley, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s who went on to play in the NBA. From CNN:
        
          Kavanaugh himself cited Dudley during last Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in the course of arguing that he’d never been a blackout-level “sloppy drunk,” as another classmate had alleged in a Washington Post piece. “I do not think that’s a fair characterization,” Kavanaugh said. “Chris Dudley’s quoted in that article, and I would refer you to what Chris Dudley said. I spent more time with Chris Dudley in college than just about anyone.” (Said Dudley to the Post: “I went out with him all the time. He never blacked out. Never even close to blacked out.”)
        
          Well, the New York Times reported Monday night that Kavanaugh and Dudley were questioned by New Haven, Connecticut, police after a 1985 bar fight, which a witness said that Kavanaugh instigated by throwing ice at another patron who’d cursed at him. (Yale’s campus is in New Haven.) Dudley then allegedly smashed a beer glass on the man’s head, opening a wound on his ear that required treatment at a hospital. (At the time, Dudley denied to police that he’d attacked the man and Kavanaugh declined to say whether he’d thrown ice.)
        
          The Times said in its report that it could not find any indication that anyone was arrested or charged with a crime related to the incident, but on Tuesday, CNN reported that Dudley was, in fact, arrested and taken to jail:
        
          There’s still no indication that Dudley was charged with a crime for the alleged attack; he doesn’t appear to have yet commented on the Times or CNN reports.
        
          In responding to the allegation by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party, Dudley has also said that Kavanaugh was never “disrespectful or inappropriate with women” during their time together. A fourth classmate, Lynne Brookes, told CNN that’s not true either, describing an incident in which she saw Dudley and Kavanaugh intentionally interrupt a sexual encounter to “embarass” the woman involved:
        
          (Of note: Both Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her and Ramirez’s allegation of indecent exposure involved other men in the room who were laughing at/egging Kavanaugh on.)
        
          Chris Dudley might have been the wrong choice as a character witness.

          In an email Monday night, Harvard Law School announced that Brett Kavanaugh will not teach a class at this school in the winter, saying the Supreme Court nominee had decided he could not longer commit to teaching.
        
          The announcement followed several protests by students at Harvard, where Kavanaugh had taught since 2009. Hundreds of graduates from Harvard Law School signed a letter calling on the school to rescind Kavanaugh’s appointment as a lecturer.
        
          “Now more than ever, HLS must send a clear message that it takes sexual violence seriously,” the letter reads. “The accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, including those by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, are credible and grave. They seriously call into question his character and morality, and should disqualify him from a lifetime appointment as a Supreme Court Justice. They likewise should disqualify him from any position of esteem, including lectureships at HLS.”
        
          Law school students sent letters calling for a Harvard-led investigation, according to the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, and about 300 first-year law students signed them. Other law students wrote to professors, and on Sept. 24, hundreds of Harvard students walked out of class to stand in solidarity with Kavanaugh’s accusers. During the hearing three days later, students continued to protest, carrying anti-Kavanaugh signs. And, according to the Crimson, the Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to ask the university to investigate the allegations before Kavanaugh be allowed back to the law school to teach.
        
          At Yale Law School, where Kavanaugh studied, students and faculty have also spoken out against the nominee. Last week, the law school’s dean joined the American Bar Association in calling for another investigation.

          Brett Kavanaugh’s drinking habits in high school and college have been called into question, fundamentally because they could mean he engaged in behavior while drunk that he did not and does not recall, such as a sexual assault. But also because Kavanaugh, under oath, appears to have grievously misrepresented the nature of his drinking that gets at general credibility issues for the potential Supreme Court justice. To the growing corpus of unflattering anecdotes about Kavanaugh’s drinking comes a New York Times report Monday that Kavanaugh was involved in a late night barroom melee at Yale that led to the then-junior being questioned by the New Haven Police Department over what the police report described as “an assault.”
        
          The incident dates back to September 1985 at the New Haven bar Demery’s. The police report filed at the time said that a 21-year-old man at the bar accused Kavanaugh of throwing ice on him “for some unknown reason.” Chad Ludington, a classmate of Kavanaugh who has recently refuted the judge’s characterization of his drinking habits, was with Kavanaugh the night of the altercation, as was Yale basketball player and future NBA journeyman Chris Dudley.
        
          From the Times:
        
          Chris Dudley denied hitting the man in the face with a glass, who was later treated at the hospital for “bleeding from the right ear,” and Kavanaugh did not want “to say if he threw the ice or not,” the police report said.

          The White House, on Monday, said it would authorize an expansion of the FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, allowing investigators to interview whomever they see fit. Senate Democrats on Monday night remained dubious that the investigation was now finally on the level. Confidence is a feeling that no longer exists in the dreary procedural hell that the Senate has become over the past three months.
        
          “I’d like to see something in writing,” Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono told me when asked if she was pleased with the news. “I’d like to. I don’t necessarily expect to. But if the investigation is not complete and done in a professional way without these limitations that we’re hearing being placed by either the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee or by the White House, it will be a sham.
        
          “And we don’t want this to be a sham,” she said. Noted.
        
          “What do they mean by expand?” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. “Going from four witnesses to six witnesses? Is that their idea of ‘expanding’ it?”
        
          On Monday, Judiciary Committee Democrats released their own list of 24 witnesses whom they think FBI should investigate, and Blumenthal said that each witness could have additional leads. He compared the work to reporting.
        
          “When somebody says to you, as a reporter, ‘You know, I don’t know that much about this, but my buddy Blumenthal—or somebody—might,’ you call the buddy,” he said. For FBI investigators not to follow up on these leads, then, would be the journalistic equivalent of never calling the buddy, giving up, and writing a hot take instead.
        
          A theme emerged that, even if the White House had authorized the FBI to investigate every student in Maryland and Connecticut from the 1980s, there wouldn’t be nearly enough time to complete it given the strict one-week limitation that expires Friday.
        
          “Take the time to do it right,” Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy advised. “We’re talking about a week or two extra? Do it right. Get everything. You’re talking about a lifetime appointment.
        
          “Certainly the majority leader had no worry about keeping the seat vacant for over a year [over] Merrick Garland, a man who would have sailed through here,” he continued.
        
          Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy too noted that “it’s tough to do an exhaustive investigation given the time limitation.” He did concede that he was “glad to see [the investigation is] expanding rather than contracting.” Small victories.
        
          In his opening remarks Monday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made “a small prediction” about the conclusion of the investigation: “Soon enough, the goal posts will be on the move once again.”
        
          In other words, this Senate week began the same way that every Senate week has begun since Kavanaugh was nominated in July: with a procedural dispute that political incentives ensure will never be resolved.
        
          After Kavanaugh’s nomination, the chamber spent two months bickering about how many of his textual records from his tenure in the George W. Bush White House should be made public. Republicans requested just enough—though through a nontraditional vetting process—to appear as though they were acting in the ballpark of good faith. Democrats griped that those hundreds of thousands of pages were still a small percentage of what was available.
        
          After Christine Blasey Ford’s identity became public and she agreed to testify, a week of the people’s time was consumed by haggling over the parameters of the hearing. Who would testify first? Would an FBI investigation be conducted ahead of time? Would there be witnesses? When would it be?
        
          And now we have this debate over the scope of the FBI investigation. Either Senate Republicans or the White House—they blamed each other on Monday, because why not?—tried to tailor the FBI’s inquiries to a handful of witnesses. The White House now says those constraints have been lifted. But who believes that Donald Trump, who hates the FBI, is really giving the agency free rein to go wherever it wants to investigate his prized Supreme Court nominee? Why wouldn’t the fix be in?
        
          The same DNA runs through all of these procedural arguments. Democrats want maximal investigation and disclosure of anything relating to Brett Kavanaugh because they want to defeat his nomination. Republicans—with the temporary exceptions of Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Jeff Flake—want as little investigation and disclosure of Brett Kavanaugh because they want him confirmed. McConnell would have had them vote in July based on a CV and a headshot, but optics required at least a theatrical performance of “due diligence.” Some documents. An engineered she-said, he-said hearing. Asking the FBI to call up four extremely lawyered-up witnesses, again.
        
          It will never be possible to reconcile these two positions. Democrats will always be hungry for more information on Kavanaugh. (And why not? After his livid, blubbering, accusatory performance before the Judiciary Committee last week, it feels like we’re only just getting to know the guy.) Republicans believe they’ve already embarrassed themselves by giving Democrats this much control over the process.
        
          McConnell said in his floor remarks Monday that the Senate would vote on Kavanaugh “this week,” shortly after the FBI investigation is complete or reaches its deadline. Will that happen? It wouldn’t jibe with rule No. 1 of procedural hell: It never ends.
        
          “He said that they’d vote last week, too,” Leahy told reporters.

          Just before the Supreme Court kicked off its new term Monday morning, Solicitor General Noel Francisco popped into the courtroom to make the rounds. Francisco beamed as he greeted spectators near the front of the room, then glad-handed attorneys with a chummy bonhomie. He had good reason to smile. Francisco will seize control of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, allowing him to hobble or scrap the probe. Last term, Francisco turned the solicitor general’s office into an organ of the conservative legal movement, scoring major blows against unions and voting rights while bolstering expansive presidential power. Now, with Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation looming, Francisco is poised to continue his extraordinary winning streak, persuading a new five-justice conservative majority to create a brave new world of reactionary jurisprudence that will entrench Republican power for decades.
        
          It all was set to start on Monday with a frog.
        
          Not just any frog, though—the dusky gopher frog, a charismatic little critter that, like Roe v. Wade, is teetering on the edge of extinction. There are only about 135 dusky gopher frogs left in the wild, and they all live near a small pond in Mississippi. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has plans to expand the frog’s territory into neighboring Louisiana. Their efforts spurred a lawsuit that pits the timber industry against the Endangered Species Act in a case that was supposed to give Kavanaugh his first opportunity to kneecap environmental regulations. As his nomination remains stalled in the Senate, however, Weyerhaeuser v. Fish and Wildlife Service may evenly divide the court and produce a stalemate that buys the little frog an unexpected shot at survival.
        
          Weyerhaeuser reads like a case designed to drive conservatives into a blind rage, and it has done precisely that. Fox & Friends produced a segment on the issue that was so misleading it spurred the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue a rebuttal. A lower-court judge was so incensed by her colleagues’ decision in favor of the FWS that she accused them of “play[ing] dead” just like the frog. The case began in 2012, when the FWS designated a swath of Louisiana land as “essential critical habitat” for the species. It doesn’t live there now, but it used to, and the land contains rare “ephemeral ponds” necessary for the frog to breed. The FWS asserted that, with “reasonable efforts,” the area can be restored to suit the species’ needs.
        
          Part of that land is leased by Weyerhaeuser, a timber company that would prefer to harvest the trees for profit. It sued the FWS, arguing that the area could not be “essential critical habitat” for the frog because it currently lives in other places and could not occupy the land in question without improvements. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Weyerhaeuser, deferring to the Fish and Wildlife Service’s interpretation of the word “habitat.” That decision was doubly infuriating to conservatives because it combined environmental preservation (bad) with judicial deference to a federal agency (even worse).
        
          The 5th Circuit’s decision also happens to be correct under a straightforward reading of the Endangered Species Act. As Justice Elena Kagan pointed out to Timothy Bishop, who represents Weyerhaeuser, the anti-frog argument makes little sense. It’s “counterintuitive,” she told Bishop, that the law “would prefer extinction of the species to the designation of an area which requires only certain reasonable improvements in order to support the species.” And it “does not seem a result that’s demanded at all by the statutory language,” since the ESA “contemplates that habitats will exist even beyond the areas where a species currently resides.” Indeed, the law defines “critical habitat” as areas both “within” and “outside” the “geographical area occupied by the species.” There’s no textual basis on which to conclude that land unoccupied by the dusky gopher frog today cannot be designated a critical habitat .
        
          Justice Samuel Alito was not only unconvinced—he was irritated by Kagan’s questions. “Now this case is going to be spun … as a choice between whether the dusky gopher frog is going to become extinct or not,” he said—a clear rebuke to Kagan. “We’ve already heard questions along this line.” But that, he insisted, is “not the choice at all.” The real question is “who should pay for the preservation of this public good.” In other words, why should a corporation suffer just because some tree-huggers in the federal government want to keep this frog alive?
        
          “Now it may be very difficult for a lot of people to shed tears for a big corporation like the one in this case,” Alito continued. But imagine Weyerhaeuser were “a family farm” instead. Wouldn’t it be tragic if Old Macdonald couldn’t raise his ducks because the dusky gopher frog had to breed in his ephemeral ponds?
        
          Justice Stephen Breyer, always eager to play peacemaker, tried to bridge the gap between Kagan and Alito by identifying what, exactly, Weyerhaeuser would need to do to let the frog live on its land. (Or let somebody else do: Typically, a corporation just invites an environmental group to figure it out.) Could the FWS ask a landowner to “drain the swamp?” Breyer asked twice, with no apparent sense of irony. Or “make a canopy?” Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, defending the FWS, asserted that the landowners need only make “reasonable efforts.” That spurred Justice Neil Gorsuch to pester him about the phrase. “Where do you get ‘reasonable efforts’ in the statute?” he demanded. “Can you show me where?” Gorsuch then answered his own question—“It’s not there!”—with a triumphant smirk.
        
          There’s little doubt that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas will side against the FWS with Alito and Gorsuch. But without Kavanaugh’s fifth vote, they’ll still lose: So long as the liberal justices vote as a bloc, the case will deadlock 4–4, leaving the 5th Circuit’s pro-frog ruling in place. Kavanaugh was supposed to be on the court by now, but late-breaking sexual assault allegations have held up his confirmation. That delay may have saved the dusky gopher frog from annihilation.
        
          Francisco wasn’t the only conservative celebrity in the courtroom on Monday. Ginni Thomas was also present in the seats reserved for friends and family of the justices. A Republican activist and consultant who’s married to Justice Clarence Thomas, Ginni is a fierce defender of both Trump and Kavanaugh. Monday’s arguments may be some of the last before Kavanaugh joins the court, empowering Thomas to turn his once-fringe views into the law of the land. Was Ginni there to witness the final days of her husband’s marginalization before he reshapes the court in his image? Like Francisco, she had every reason to smile. The dusky gopher frog may live. But nearly every liberal precedent of the last century will soon be on death’s door.

          Republican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake has developed a reputation as someone who is willing to criticize Donald Trump and his party enablers in unusually blunt terms—but not generally willing to use his status as a potential swing vote in a narrowly divided Senate to initiate investigations into administration corruption, protect Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation, or achieve any of the other good-governance goals he might be expected to support given his feelings on Trumpism.
        
          That was Flake’s reputation, at least, before he announced a dramatic effort last Friday to delay Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote until the FBI could conduct a weeklong review of sexual assault accusations against the Supreme Court nominee. When it became clear that fellow Trump-skeptic GOP senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski supported Flake’s position, the White House almost immediately agreed to order just such an investigation. (Without those three senators, Republicans would only have 48 votes to confirm Kavanaugh.)
        
          Over the weekend, though, there was some grinding in the gears. NBC reported, and other outlets confirmed, that the White House had set narrow limits on which individuals the FBI was allowed to contact. The bureau was reportedly told to interview just four specific people with connections to two of the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, an order which seemed to shut down several other potentially fruitful avenues of inquiry into Kavanaugh’s past conduct and trustworthiness that had been raised by his Senate testimony and in news reports. It appeared that Flake et. al had done little more than create a process by which Kavanaugh’s confirmation could be made slightly more palatable to middle-of-the-road voters.
        
          On Monday, Flake said at an event in Boston that he and unnamed Senate colleagues were pushing back against the White House counsel’s office and asking to give the FBI discretion to conduct a “real investigation” into Kavanaugh—one that would involve gathering any information and speaking to any witnesses it chooses. Was this just another case of Jeff Flake talking the talk? Well, maybe not:
        
          That’s from the New York Times, whose scoop was soon confirmed by NBC.
        
          Jeff Flake, walking the walk? What a world!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/charles-grassley-refers-rhode-island-tipster-fbi-false-statement-about-kavanaugh.html,"
          The Senate Judiciary Committee takes very seriously when people lie to it. That’s why it referred a man in Rhode Island who told committee member Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse “that in August of 1985, Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a close acquaintance of Mr. [redacted] on a boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island,” for prosecution by the feds.
        
          You may think that Whitehouse, who received the original tip, was outraged about being lied to and brought forward the referral to committee Chairman Sen. Charles Grassley. But no, it was Grassley, who said in the letter that Kavanaugh had “categorically denied” the claim and that the original tipster had recanted it on social media after the committee released portions of its interview with Kavanaugh last week. Grassley made the referral in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray on Saturday.
        
          “When individuals provide fabricated allegations to the Committee, diverting Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations, it materially impedes our work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal. It is illegal to make materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements to Congressional investigators. It is illegal to obstruct Committee investigations,” Grassley said in his letter.
        
          Whitehouse’s spokesman told CNN on Sunday that Grassley’s referral was “meritless” and that the “deliberate outing” of the tipster and the referral itself was “causing a cascade of abuse” and was “meant as a threat to discourage the cooperation of others with the FBI investigation.”
        
          Earlier last week, Whitehouse said in a letter that he had asked the committee staff not to reveal the accuser’s name to Kavanugh in its interview. The committee staff revealed the name anyway, Whitehouse said, and what’s more, they asked Kavanaugh about “unrelated statements on the constituent’s social media account.”
        
          “I was not in Newport, haven’t been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat, nor all those three things combined,” Kavanaugh said in his interview with committee staff members. “This is just completely made up, or at least not me. I don’t know what they’re referring to.”
        
          The staffers then said the tipster “appears to have a Twitter account … [that] identifies the account holder as a ‘hippie … from Rhode Island’ ” and asked Kavanaugh, “Are you aware that on June 27th of this year, the account tweeted, ‘A question, when will the United States military decided to do what they have vowed and remove the domestic threat to the Constitution that lives in the White House?’ “
        
          Whitehouse said in the letter last week, “it is not clear what legitimate investigative purpose this served and raises additional concerns that the steps being taken by your staff have been driven by political interests.”
        
          Before Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified last Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee released a range of documents from its investigation, including two further claims of Kavanugh assaulting unknown victims, which some people saw as an effort to muddy the water around the claims by Ford and Deborah Ramirez. That same night, the man who called in the Rhode Island tip recanted his accusation on Twitter.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/michael-avenatti-julie-swetnick-self-promotion.html,"
          Democratic lawyer and prospective 2020 presidential candidate Michael Avenatti represents a woman named Julie Swetnick who’s made grave accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Swetnick says she attended parties with Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in the early ’80s at which the pair targeted girls with spiked drinks and then took advantage of them sexually; she says she was raped by multiple people at one such gathering. (Kavanaugh and Judge deny any involvement in such activities, and to be clear, Swetnick did not say they were among the individuals who raped her, merely that they were “present” on the night she was attacked.)
        
          Avenatti is handling these timely and serious allegations as if he’s marketing a new Cloverfield movie:
        
          The woman on the right is NBC’s Kate Snow, which makes this what is likely the first-ever instance of a cryptic, hashtag-saturated promotional still being used to hype a news interview about being drugged and sexually assaulted.
        
          Avenatti’s tweet—which, for a time, appeared on his Twitter feed just below his “pinned” list of seemingly 2020-minded campaign positions—is not just in poor taste; it also highlights the tactically questionable way he’s handled Swetnick’s allegations. Avenatti first publicized her account last Wednesday by posting her sworn declaration on Twitter; while such a formal document is credible in and of itself, NBC appears to be the first media outlet that Swetnick has spoken to at length, and a source told CNN’s Brian Stelter that the network is still verifying details related to her story. That means at least five days will have passed between the announcement of her allegations and the first independent reporting that includes an interview with her—five days during which Kavanaugh’s nomination passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the FBI reopened a background check into him that doesn’t appear likely to address her claims. In the meantime, though, Avenatti did find time to tweet confrontationally at Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sen. Chuck Grassley, Fox News’ Laura Ingraham (he said he’d “enjoy” embarrassing Ingraham by bringing more information about Swetnick to light), and NBC’s Megyn Kelly.
        
          Wait, did I say five days? That’s just who Avenatti has tweeted at since Sunday morning. Before that, he also picked fights related to Swetnick’s charges with Sen. Ted Cruz, Fox News legal pundit Alan Dershowitz, Fox News host Tucker Carlson, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, and Donald Trump Jr. This openly partisan approach has had the predictable result of incentivizing Republicans, who are calling the shots on the FBI investigation, to ignore Swetnick’s allegations as the work of a “porn lawyer.” They would have wanted to ignore the allegations anyway, of course—but consider that Kavanaugh’s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who went public via a New Yorker story that featured material supporting the plausibility of her story, subsequently was included on the list of witnesses to be contacted during the reopened FBI investigation. (Ramirez, who lives in Colorado, has been represented by Boulder attorneys John Clune and Stanley Garnett and D.C. attorney William Pittard.) Public pressure to hear out Kavanaugh’s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford—who is represented by Democratic attorney Debra Katz but who came forward by speaking to the Washington Post—was strong enough that Republicans invited her to testify before Congress.
        
          Not everything about the timing of Swetnick’s case is under Avenatti’s control, of course: She may have felt compelled to speak up in part to support the other women making allegations. But Avenatti does have discretion over the way he discusses Swetnick’s claims in public, and the way he’s doing so indicates that he sees them in large part as an instrument with which to rally his liberal Twitter fans against Fox News and the Republican Party. In a confirmation process that hinges on the votes of moderate Republican senators like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski—who are more likely to care about the opinions of independent voters than MSNBC loyalists—that’s not just tasteless. It’s self-defeating.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-rachel-mitchell-memo-christine-blasey-ford.html,"
          On Monday, the Washington Post published a memo that Rachel Mitchell, the sex crimes prosecutor who questioned Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday, sent to Senate Republicans with her analysis from the hearing.
        
          During Ford’s testimony, observers noted how even-handed Mitchell’s questioning seemed to be given the partisan nature of her role. Her questions to Ford often appeared to probe for inconsistencies intended to undermine Ford’s credibility. But, as Ford was careful with her words, so was Mitchell, and she stopped short of shaping those questions into fully realized arguments that could have made her appear to be attacking an alleged sexual assault victim. Her tone toward Ford was respectful and patient. And for the brief period she was allowed to question Kavanaugh, she made a show of being willing to question his account, too—to the point that some Republicans complained that she was working for the wrong side.
        
          Some observers were surprised, then, to find a dramatically different version of Mitchell in the memo she sent out to Senate Republicans—one much more prosecutorial and partisan. In the five-page memo, Mitchell focused only on Ford’s testimony, ignoring the second half of the hearing that involved Kavanaugh facing questions. She emphasized that she was acting as an independent professional, not motivated by party politics, despite having been hired by Senate Republicans.
        
          She wrote:
        
          She then went on to outline what the gaps in Ford’s memory and the inconsistencies in Ford’s accounts—from her testimony, her communications with reporters, her records from therapy sessions, her statements during a polygraph test, and her confidential letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein—that Mitchell considered potentially troubling.
        
          But as Mitchell stipulated in her memo, her assessment of Ford’s allegations were primarily held to standards she would use in a criminal case. Just as Democrats have repeatedly emphasized that a confirmation hearing is a job interview, rather than a criminal prosecution, Mitchell emphasized that she was working within a legal context and could not speak to the standards of a political procedure like a Supreme Court nomination. The suggestion, therefore, is that her legal opinion should not be considered as an official conclusion. It will likely still be touted by Republicans before the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.
        
          Each of the points she brings up in the memo easily could be challenged on its own. They include:
        
          • Slight inconsistencies about the time frame in which the alleged assault occurred and the number of people at the party;• Ford’s inability to remember some details about the party, including how she got home;• Her delay in naming Kavanaugh when talking about the assault in therapy;• The statements by alleged witnesses saying they did not remember the party;• Her decision not to provide her therapy notes to the committee;• Her claims of having a fear of flying, while also having taken flights for vacations; and• Questions about her reasons for disclosing her allegations against Kavanaugh.
        
          But beyond protests against these points, critics were more baffled by the absence of Kavanaugh from the memo itself. He was only mentioned in reference to Ford’s testimony, and while Mitchell was pulled from questioning Kavanaugh early in his turn before the committee, she was able to ask him some questions about the substance of his account—questions that touched on inconsistencies.
        
          The memo does seem intended to provide validation for any Republican senators with doubts about casting their votes with the party, but there is always a chance—admittedly a relatively small one, given the tight restrictions—that a reopened FBI background investigation could provide evidence to counteract some of the pro-Kavanaugh messaging of this dubiously independent outside prosecutor.

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-female-blackout-messages-campaign-domestic-violence-kavanaugh.html,"
          Over the weekend, you might have received a Facebook message asking you to participate in something called a “female blackout.” Or perhaps Monday morning you noticed a few blacked-out profile pictures in your Facebook feed. Or maybe you didn’t see either and all you caught was the backlash to the blackout. Whatever the case, here’s what’s going on.
        
          On Saturday, women began circulating the following instructions through Facebook messages:
        
          As with many chain letters (and this one has gone around before), it was unclear who started this project or exactly what it was about—for example, did it relate to the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, an issue that has galvanized women nationwide over the past few weeks, or was the timing just a coincidence? Blackouts, the kind that involve alcohol, have certainly been part of the discussion surrounding Kavanaugh. As Jezebel pointed out, there’s frequently a link between drinking and domestic violence. But the text of the message kept things vague, only mentioning “a project against domestic abuse.”
        
          Though the message, or at least the version of it that I got in my own inbox and saw screenshots of, did not explicitly mention that women should keep mum on social media in addition to blacking out their profile photos, some commenters read the message that way—and took issue with it.
        
          It’s a fair point: Why should women attempt to raise awareness about an issue by being silent? Shouldn’t a campaign like this be an occasion for women to speak up? Silence is also a particularly ineffective tactic for a social media campaign: In order to see that a woman has blacked out her avatar, she must be posting and participating in the social media conversation.
        
          Social media campaigns are of course not useless—just look at #MeToo—but this one seems more likely to confuse people or simply be ignored. Its hazy provenance should probably also invite skepticism, particularly given the recent history of foreign trolls faking social-justice campaigns. Between that, its imprecise goals, and its apparently underthought strategy, it’s no surprise that the female blackout amounted to barely more than a flicker.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-interview-heidi-schreck-play.html,"
          As a teenager, Heidi Schreck saved up money for college by winning debate competitions on the importance on the U.S. Constitution in American Legion halls across the Pacific Northwest. As an adult—an acclaimed playwright, actor, and writer for TV shows like Billions and I Love Dick (the landmark episode “A Short History of Weird Girls,” with fellow playwright Annie Baker)—she’s come back to the subject of the nation’s founding document with a considerably more skeptical eye.
        
          In What the Constitution Means to Me, which opened Sunday at New York Theatre Workshop and runs through Oct. 28, Schreck takes the stage surrounded by wood-paneled walls and endless rows of white men in military uniforms, attended by a stopwatch-wielding legionnaire as she runs through a re-creation of her prize-winning teenage talk. (The original is lost, although she remembers that it hinged on the idea that “the Constitution is like a crucible” and climaxed with a citation from “The Hollow Men.”) Schreck warns the audience at the beginning that she’s not going to do anything to make herself seem like she’s 15, and that’s because the adult Heidi keeps stepping to the fore, pointing out how the Constitution’s purportedly equal protections have often failed to apply in practice, especially for anyone who doesn’t look like the white men who wrote it. Encompassing the history of sexual assault and domestic violence in Schreck’s family as well as her own, constitutionally protected (for now) abortion—which, like any good Gen Xer, Schreck relates to Dirty Dancing—the play floats between dramatic re-creation and first-person monologue, climaxing with a nightly debate between Schreck and a teenage constitutional scholar. A few days before opening night, Schreck sat down with Slate to talk about the 14th Amendment, debating teenagers, and why you can’t be neutral on a moving train.
        
          Sam Adams: Not counting your stint as a teenage orator, you’ve been working on pieces of What the Constitution Means to Me for 10 years, but it’s coming to fruition in a period—even a week—where the future and the legitimacy of the Constitution is very much under debate. Is that why you decided to do it now?
        
          Heidi Schreck: It was not, no. I first performed a version of the piece in 2015, when Obama was still president. It honestly has changed very little since then. It simply has become, sadly, more relevant. But all the things I was exploring in the play have been in the play since the beginning—things having to do with women’s bodily autonomy, and the history and legacy of violence in my own family, and sexual assault in my own family. It just happens to be dominating the national conversation right now.
        
          The fact that you’re talking about sexual violence and domestic abuse also aligns the play with the #MeToo movement, but there too it’s odd to talk about it being “timely,” as if these issues just started existing last year.
        
          I’m thrilled to support #MeToo in whatever way I can, but the play is about the intersection of a lot of different constitutional issues, and that is one of them. My mom is a sexual assault survivor, and she was very open about it when we were growing up. At one point—this was in the ’80s—she published a letter to the editor supporting a girl who’d been sexually abused and stated her own history. So from my perspective, women have been telling these stories for a really long time, and it’s just no one has been listening the way they are now. I think that’s clear even if you think about Tarana Burke starting this movement back in 2006. What’s changed is the fact that people are taking these stories seriously now.
        
          One of the things about approaching this as theater, particularly the kind of theater you’re doing, is that it feels like there’s the potential for the play to be different every night. There are moments when you’re on-script or even reading from index cards, and moments when you could be talking about what happened earlier that day. 
        
          I have the ability to change as I go along. It’s a living, breathing document. I’m working with two constitutional scholars, so as things come up in the news, I’ll call them and ask them for advice, questions, and I will change my synthesis of some ideas night by night, based on what new understanding that I have. But, actually, the index cards in the show serve a very particular purpose, which, because I’m telling a story of sexual trauma, I read it simply because it’s easier for me. That story, obviously, I know—I’ve known it since I was a teenager. It’s one of the most important stories in my family, and I just don’t want to have to completely relive it night after night, and so I read it.
        
          You’re an actor as well as a writer, so it’s too easy to assume that what you’re performing isn’t what you’re really feeling, but when you get emotional on stage, it doesn’t feel like, “And now we have arrived at the part of the play where I start to cry.”
        
          Right, no. I find the stories affect me differently every night, and my only goal is to get through it and speak the stories out loud, because I think there’s great power in that, and however I’m responding emotionally that night is affected by whatever is happening.
        
          You’ve said that during the first workshop performance last year, you actually walked offstage because you had to compose yourself.
        
          I did. It was interesting for me, because like I said, my mom’s been very outspoken her whole life about her abuse, but I didn’t realize how deeply I’d internalized the taboo about talking about violence against women. I didn’t realize how much I’d internalized the taboo about talking about abortion. I didn’t realize until I tried to speak publicly that that was scary for me.
        
          The title What the Constitution Means to Me seems self-explanatory, but because you’re playing both yourself as a teenage and yourself as an adult, the “me” isn’t fixed. It makes the play a dialogue about what you thought then and what you think now. How has that changed?
        
          I was an idealistic 15-year-old. I was a debate nerd. My dad is a history teacher. I grew up in a conservative town. I believed deeply in the genius of this document. To be clear, I still do, but I was a teenager in the ’80s, and I had a very whitewashed understanding of our history, and a very idealistic vision of our history. I grew up, went to college, learned a lot, read Howard Zinn. But when I started to make this piece, I didn’t know where it was headed. I just thought it would be interesting to take the prompt of the contest seriously and look at the Constitution now, try to understand how it affects my life, how it has affected my life and the life of my ancestors, just take that as far as I could go.
        
          In doing that, I became even more disillusioned about some aspects of our country than I had been. I also learned things about my own family history that were troubling and difficult to grapple with. That progression from idealistic 15-year-old to a 40-year-old really struggling to understand my place as a woman in this culture, and in relationship to this document, is a real struggle. It’s something I’ve actually gone through while making the piece. I think that that’s what gets represented onstage as the 15-year-old me becoming fortysomething-year-old me.
        
          You end the performance by debating a teenage girl on stage, which is a little like coming face to face with your old self.
        
          My idea was to bring in someone who was my age when I started doing this contest, and truly just to find out what they’re thinking about our country and the Constitution. And they had to be a champion debater, because I wanted to have this live debate on stage. That has been one of the most gratifying things about the whole process. We spent weeks in a room with these two teenage debaters, we did practice debates, we would split into three groups, we had dramaturgs and stage managers, everyone would join a think tank, we would come up with our ideas. Thursday Williams, who you saw, she’s actually practiced constitutional debate, she interned at the Sonia Sotomayor institute. She actually knows more about the Constitution than I do.
        
          The judge you picked from the audience the night I saw the play chose you, but I have to say, I think Thursday kind of crushed you.
        
          Oh, that was terrible! That was the first time she got a loss. That was so devastating. She came back the next time, and she just decimated me. I’ve actually just learned a lot from her. She’s thinking about these issues at a very deep level, way deeper than I was at 17.
        
          You end the play with what amounts to an up-or-down vote on the Constitution: Should we keep it or abolish it and start over? Do you have a favorite side in that debate?
        
          I mean, I love arguing that we should abolish it. I don’t believe we should abolish it. But I find it interesting and fun talking on that side.
        
          I found myself swayed in both directions while the two of you were talking.
        
          Oh, good, I’m so glad. Yeah, I was surprised now … so that was the first time that Thursday lost, but since then, both Rosdely [Ciprian] and Thursday have lost a couple times, which I never expected, and I’m kind of excited by that.
        
          So much of looking at the Constitution now is thinking about its promises unfulfilled, but you have to ask as well which of those promises were ever meant to be fulfilled. 
        
          I mean, it does use the phrase, “We the people.” They just didn’t intend most of us to be part of that. I learned so much creating this, and one thing I didn’t understand before I started working on it was the difference between positive and negative rights, and it’s been a revelation to me that many countries, in this century and the 20th century, made positive rights constitutions, including countries with similar histories of violence and oppression, like Germany and South Africa. This idea that you can have a document that enshrined the right to health care, public education, basic standard of living, I find that thrilling, and it does make me question our document in a new way.
        
          You spend a lot of time on the 14th Amendment, which contains the Equal Protection Clause, but also on Castle Rock v. Gonzales, where the Supreme Court ruled that a police department could not be sued for failing to enforce a restraining order, which allowed a woman’s estranged husband to kidnap and murder three of their children.
        
          That was a big discovery for me in making the piece, the understanding that the Constitution did not require that kind of positive protection. It seems clear to me that violence against women is one of the biggest human rights violations in our country, probably in the world. What does it mean that our Constitution doesn’t protect us from that?
        
          You say in the play that “If your stance is neutral, then you are perpetuating violence.” Can you talk about that idea?
        
          I’ve been going to these workshops called Undoing Racism, which I really recommend. And one of the underlying principles is that, if you’re a white person, unless you’re actively doing something to undo racism, actively participating in trying to undo those structures, you are in fact perpetuating it, just by sitting in your role as a white person. I found that very meaningful, and it made me think about the Constitution and this idea of negative rights, and the people who are originalists, in terms of the Constitution saying, “Well, the idea is that it protects all of us equally.” So you can say the Warren court, the activist court, went too far. But I believe that stance that says, “Oh, it protects all of us equally,” assumes that there’s some kind of equality in our culture, assumes that it was born out of equality, which it wasn’t. The document excluded so many people from the beginning, because our culture is set up to exclude so many people, and to give power to one group of people—obviously, white men—that a neutral [view of that] document just perpetuates that problem.
        
          To go back to original intent, it’s not like the founders overlooked women or people of color. They specifically meant for the Constitution to not represent them.
        
          Yes. So my increasingly passionate view is that the law, and perhaps the Constitution, or maybe an equal rights amendment, needs to take active steps in order to rectify the inequality that is at the heart of our society. And if it’s not taking active steps, then it’s perpetuating violence and misogyny and racism.
        
          And you feel that way as an artist, too?
        
          I do. And I will say, I had the luxury, for many years … I was a woman playwright, a cis woman playwright, but I thought of my whiteness as some sort of neutral state, which it’s not. In the last decade, I’ve come to understand deeply how I’m writing from a very particular perspective, and that if I don’t question my assumptions about that perspective, I’m perpetuating inequality.
        
          Your first play, Creature, was about Margery Kempe, a medieval Englishwoman who believed she had conversations with God, and What the Constitution Means to Me is about faith as well, albeit a secular kind. What brings you back to that subject?
        
          Faith was a hot topic in my family growing up. My mom was an atheist, my dad taught Bible study, and now my mom goes to church, and my dad wrote his dissertation on Kierkegaard. So it was a constant topic of discussion and argument in my family. And in college, I became really interested in medieval women writers, who, of course, are all religious. So I just always had a fascination with people’s relationship to divinity or God or whatever you want to call it. I’m agnostic myself. And I guess, with this play, the Constitution, people do worship it. It has a kind of biblical status. It’s like liturgy. I became agnostic as a teenager, and didn’t necessarily believe in the Bible, but I did believe in the Constitution, so, for me, it is kind of the book I have to question.

          Ordinarily, Last Week Tonight devotes its main segment to some obscure, complex topic like felony disenfranchisement or astroturfing. Occasionally, though, a news story will be so dominant that host John Oliver will devote a full half-hour to unpacking it, as he did on Sunday night’s episode. True to the name of the show, Last Week Tonight dug into the most important event of last week, and no, it wasn’t the introduction of the terrifying new Philadelphia Flyers’ mascot, Gritty. Instead, Oliver weighed in on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to address allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          Oliver goes over the hearing in detail, offering play-by-play commentary and jokes about how Kavanaugh’s testimony at one point sounded a lot like “Mambo No. 5.” Of course, every minute of Kavanaugh and accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony has already been scrutinized and picked apart a hundred times over, so what Oliver is offering is more catharsis than any revelatory insight. Still, he does a good job of recapping the exhausting, daylong event and the arguments that followed it, and he makes some solid points about Kavanaugh’s performance being “positively Trumpian.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-fbi-investigation-witnesses.html,"
          The New Yorker reported Sunday that several people who have tried to contact the FBI with information about Brett Kavanaugh and his behavior in high school and college have said they were unable to reach FBI agents to give their accounts.
        
          The potential witnesses include an anonymous Yale classmate and Elizabeth Rasor, a former girlfriend of Kavanaugh’s high school friend Mark Judge. Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyer has also said that, as of Sunday, her client has not been contacted by the FBI. “We’ve tried repeatedly to speak with the FBI, but heard nothing back,” she said.
        
          Rasor was quoted in an earlier New Yorker story from September contradicting Judge’s assertion that there was no “rough-housing” with girls during high school. She said Judge had told her about an incident in which he and other boys at Georgetown Prep took turns having sex with the same drunk girl.
        
          But Rasor’s lawyer has said that, despite her client “repeatedly ma[king] clear to the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the F.B.I. that she would like the opportunity to speak to them,” the only response she received were emails confirming her emails had been received and advice from one agent that she try calling an 800-number tip line.
        
          Similarly, an unnamed Yale classmate seeking to corroborate Deborah Ramirez’s account of Kavanaugh exposing himself to her at a party in college has said he repeatedly and unsuccessfully tried to contact the FBI. He told the New Yorker he is certain he heard about the account around the time of the alleged incident, but when he tried to reach the FBI, he was redirected multiple times to different offices and phone numbers until he simply left a tip through an online portal. According to the New Yorker, he had also been in contact with other classmates who wanted to provide information supporting Ramirez’s story.
        
          On Sunday, a former Yale classmate came forward to challenge Kavanaugh’s depiction of his drinking habits. Charles Ludington, who said Kavanaugh often became belligerently drunk in college, has said he will try to reach the FBI at their field office in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Monday. Ramirez spoke with the FBI on Sunday and gave them a list of potential witnesses, though it’s unclear if the FBI would reach out to any of them.
        
          The report, which comes from Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow, the same duo behind other major stories about the allegations against Kavanaugh, follows a weekend of confusion about the scope of the FBI background investigation launched by President Trump on Friday. On Saturday, multiple sources reported that the White House had severely limited the scope of the investigation, telling the FBI to interview only four witnesses. The White House later rejected the assertion that they were tightly managing the investigation, arguing they were only following the guidance of the Senate. Some Republicans argued that a limited scope would be appropriate for a background investigation, which is less exhaustive than a criminal investigation, but Senate Democrats demanded the White House provide the committee with a copy of the directive it sent to the FBI.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/devils-triangle-rules-brett-kavanaugh-drinking-game.html,"
          Of all the depressing and enraging things to come from Brett Kavanaugh’s depressing and enraging confirmation hearing, the Supreme Court nominee’s shady, dissembling explanations of the slang in his high school yearbook stand alone. Let’s take a trip back to slimetown:
        
          In Kavanaugh’s defense, once he made the decision to pretend that “Beach Week Ralph Club” referred to his problems with spicy food, the rest of the disgraceful performance became as mathematically inevitable as the parabolic arc a gout of vomit traces through the air on its way toward a dorm room floor. Here’s the splash:
        
          It’s not hard to find examples of people using the phrase “Devil’s Triangle” to refer to relatively innocuous things, if you have a reason to lie about what it means. Perhaps Kavanaugh and his social circle were obsessed with musical history, and Squi built a replica of the Devil’s Triangle , as described in the Interior Journal of Stanford, Kentucky on Feb. 3, 1882:
        
          Or maybe PJ was a big Ralph Bellamy fan who dragged the whole gang to see Almost Married, an adaptation of Andrew Soutar’s 1925 novel The Devil’s Triangle:
        
          Or Kavanaugh could have gone with the obvious choice: the independently-produced 1970 TV special The Devil’s Triangle, which made its way across the country in the early 1970s before eventually being released as a (52 minute long!) theatrical feature. The trailer is a blast, because the distributor clearly couldn’t get narrator Vincent Price to record any new audio:
        
          The only area of human endeavor where you can’t find anyone using the phrase “Devil’s Triangle” (until a few days ago) seems to be drinking games. It is not listed in any edition of the definitive reference book on the subject, The Complete Book of Drinking Games, published in 1984 by “Chugger Downs” and “E.Z. Buz,” both of whom presumably make appearances in Kavanaugh’s calendar. Narrowing the scope won’t help: you won’t find it in any version of The Complete Book of Beer Drinking Games (And Other Important Stuff) by Andy Griscom and Scott Johnston either. All record of the well-known and universally beloved drinking game “Devil’s Triangle” has vanished into thin air, as cleanly as if it had sailed into the diabolic geographical area enclosed by a three-sided shape with vertices at Miami, San Juan, and Bermuda, or disappeared in a puff of gay panic after accidentally making eye contact with another man during a threesome. So how the hell do you play it? Here’s our theory.
        
          1.    The game requires three players: the Dealer, the Kavanaugh, and the Public.
        
          2.     The players are seated at the vertices of an equilateral triangle that has been drawn on a circular table using masking tape.
        
          3.     The Dealer and the Kavanaugh are each given a 14-oz. crystal Pilsner glass in Waterford’s Lismore pattern.
        
          4.     The Public is issued a red solo cup.
        
          5.     All three glasses are placed just inside the triangle, within easy reach of the players.
        
          6.    The Butler, who is not a player but is probably around given the players, fills the crystal glasses with Sapporo Space Beer, made from barley that was grown on the International Space Center. (1980s editions of the game substituted Westmalle Trippel.)
        
          7.    The Public gets Natural Light in a can. Under no circumstances is it to be chilled.
        
          8.     Play proceeds clockwise, beginning with the Public.
        
          9.     On the Public’s turn, the player takes a quarter from his or her pocket and hands it to the Dealer.
        
          10. Play then passes to the Dealer,  who takes the quarter, puts it in his pocket, drinks his beer, and is served another.
        
          11.  When play passes to the Kavanaugh, he also drinks his beer and is served another.
        
          12.  The Public is not allowed to touch his or her beer under any circumstances.
        
          13.  Play proceeds in this fashion until the Public runs out of money.
        
          14.  The Kavanaugh is summarily awarded a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.
        
          15.  The Dealer throws a single quarter into the Public’s red solo cup filled with Natural Light and instructs him or her to “Slurp it up, poor-o!”
        
          16. The Public fishes the quarter out of the cup of warm beer, goes to the nearest pay phone, randomly dials a local number, and fruitlessly attempts to find anyone else on the planet who is dumb enough to believe that “Devil’s Triangle” is a drinking game, in hopes of beginning another game as the Dealer.
        
          17.  The Kavanaugh overturns Roe v. Wade.
        
          Maybe there are other rules for playing The Devil’s Triangle that don’t end in utter disaster for the nation. Maybe Brett Kavanaugh will share them with us. But until he does, the healthiest response to being asked to keep a straight face for this bullshit is an obliteratingly stiff drink. Anything but beer.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/chad-ludington-says-kavanaugh-mischaracterized-drinking-habits-to-lawmakers.html,"
          Another former classmate is calling Brett Kavanaugh’s bluff. Chad Ludington told the New York Times that the Supreme Court nominee wasn’t exactly honest when he described his drinking habits during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week. In fact, Ludington said Kavanaugh carried out a “blatant mischaracterization” of his drinking during his college years, noting he often saw the nominee “staggering from alcohol consumption.”
        
          Ludington said Kavanaugh played down “the degree and frequency” of his drinking and had seen the judge often become “belligerent and aggressive.” The professor at North Carolina State University said he plans to take this information to the FBI. “It is truth that is at stake, and I believe that the ability to speak the truth, even when it does not reflect well upon oneself, is a paramount quality we seek in our nation’s most powerful judges,” Ludington said.
        
          Ludington is hardly the first former Yale classmate to contradict Kavanaugh’s claims about his drinking. Shortly after the Thursday hearing, Lynne Brookes told ABC News that she often “drank to excess” with Kavanaugh. “We were in the same social circles,” Brookes said. “When he would drink, he would get obnoxious.”
        
          Although the FBI’s Washington field office told Ludington to head to the bureau’s Raleigh office on Monday morning, it’s unclear whether any statement he makes will be included in the newly reopened investigation into Kavanaugh. Reports are making it clear that the FBI’s probe has a narrow scope, which Demcorats complained Sunday could turn the whole thing into a “farce,” as Sen. Mazie K. Hirono warned on ABC.

          Former FBI chief James Comey is weighing in on the FBI investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh with a New York Times op-ed that amounts to an all-out defense of agents and their ability to do their job fairly. Even though “it is idiotic to put a shot clock on the FBI,” Comey insists that the probe won’t be “as hard as Republicans hope it will be.” The ground rules of the investigation seem in part designed to prevent answers from emerging, but FBI agents “are experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow with additional interviews.”
        
          In one of the most interesting passages of the op-ed, Comey said that the “obvious lies” regarding words in his yearbook (detailed here) amount to a “flashing signal to dig deeper.” The reason is simple: “Little lies point to bigger lies.”
        
          Although Republicans have defended Kavanaugh by saying that the alleged assaults happened long ago so there’s no way the incidents could be remembered clearly, Comey insists that’s far from the truth. “Agents know time has very little to do with memory. They know every married person remembers the weather on their wedding day, no matter how long ago,” Comey wrote. “Significance drives memory.”
        
          Agents won’t actually reach a conclusion about who is telling the truth but that doesn’t mean their reports won’t point the way. “Their granular factual presentation will spotlight the areas of conflict and allow decision makers to reach their own conclusions,” he wrote. In the end, those carrying out the probe know that whatever they say, they’ll be criticized by one side or the other. But that may not necessarily be a bad thing. “There is freedom in being totally screwed,” Comey wrote. “Agents can just do their work. Find facts. Speak truth to power.”

          During interviews Sunday, in the wake of Trump’s announcement that he was launching a one-week FBI background investigation probing allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, Republicans argued the case for an investigation into the Democrats and their behavior surrounding the Kavanaugh allegations.
        
          Speaking on ABC’s This Week, Lindsey Graham, the most impassioned of Kavanaugh’s defenders in the Senate, called for an investigation into how Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations came to light.
        
          “We’re going to do a wholesale and full-scale investigation of what I think was a despicable process,” Graham said. He listed the issues he wanted to look into: “Who betrayed Dr. Ford’s trust; who in Feinstein’s office recommended Katz as a lawyer; why did Ms. Ford not know that the committee was willing to go to California?”
        
          These questions were not new: Graham raised similar ones repeatedly in a tirade Thursday in which he also demanded to know who paid for her polygraph test. (Her lawyers did, Ford had said earlier in the hearing.) “She can’t tell me the house. She can’t tell me the city. She can’t tell me the month of the year,” Graham said, ignoring Ford’s answers about the location and her suggestion that Mark Judge be interviewed, possibly providing more answers.
        
          During the hearing, Graham raised questions about how the confidential letter containing Ford’s allegations came to the attention of the Washington Post after it was given to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Some Republicans have suggested someone in Feinstein’s office leaked the information against Ford’s will, and others have criticized her for being aware of the allegations for weeks and not bringing them forward—a decision Feinstein said she made to honor Ford’s request for confidentiality. Feinstein has maintained she did not leak the allegation, and the journalist who first reported on the letter has said he did not obtain it from her office.
        
          The other questions have to do with the ways Ford was put in touch with her lawyer (raising the question of whether the Democrats hand-selected someone ideal for their cause, pointing to the political motivation behind the hearing and accusations) and why Ford was not aware of offers from the committee staff to come out to California to interview her.
        
          Graham, who called the hearing a “sham” and condemned it as a disgrace, has insisted that Democrats merely called for an investigation to stall Kavanaugh’s vote until after the midterms. And while he changed his tune when it became politically necessary for his party to support the one-week FBI background investigation, he had said repeatedly after the hearing that he believed “that he didn’t do it, that he’s the right guy to be on the court, that Ms. Ford has got a problem, and destroying Judge Kavanaugh’s life won’t fix her problem.”
        
          Sen. Tom Cotton, speaking on CBS’s Face the Nation, made a similar statement Sunday. “Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leaked that,” he said. He also said Feinstein betrayed Ford by not sharing the letter with the committee sooner.

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/kavanaugh-wikipedia-devils-triangle.html,"
          If the rest of the internet is lawless, Wikipedia stands out. Over the past 17 years, the community of Wikipedia editors has established a formal framework of policies, guidelines, and explanatory supplements to advance the goals of the project. Dutiful Wikipedians often refer to one of these rules when they remove something inappropriate from the site. If you “listen to Wikipedia” for a few minutes, you’ll see that edits like this happen all the time. What is unusual—and heretofore unprecedented—is for the objectionable content to play a role in a hearing about allegations that a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court committed sexual assault while in high school. The subject came up on Wikipedia after Thursday’s Senate hearing, in which Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse asked Kavanaugh a series of questions about “Devil’s Triangle,” a reference in his high school yearbook that had raised eyebrows. Kavanaugh claimed that Devil’s Triangle was a “drinking game” played with “three glasses in a triangle.” He said that “it’s a quarters game,” i.e., a drinking game where players bounce 25-cent pieces off the table and into cups of beer. It was an answer that many dismissed as unbelievable.
        
          Soon after Kavanaugh offered his definition, an anonymous Wikipedia editor added the following text to the Devil’s Triangle disambiguation page,  which lists and describes various meanings for a given topic: “Devil’s Triangle, a popular drinking game enjoyed by friends of judge Brett Kavanaugh.” The text was quickly removed with this warning for potential editors: “DO NOT ADD the hoax about a ‘drinking game’, especially as related by Brett Kavanaugh. We do not dignify such hoaxes with mention.”
        
          Outlets such as CNN and USA Today covered the Wikipedia story as yet another anecdote from a bizarre and disturbing confirmation process. But it’s perhaps worthwhile to reflect on the Wikipedia principles involved in deleting this content, and how specifically they apply to the “case” of the Devil’s Triangle.
        
          The policy known as What Wikipedia Is Not defines by counterexample. The list includes “Wikipedia is not a newspaper,” “Wikipedia is not a blog,” “Wikipedia is not a battleground,” and “Wikipedia is not a soapbox or means of promotion,” which specifically disallows political advocacy. At least one fact from the incident suggests the Devil’s Triangle edit was politically motivated: The edit was made anonymously from an IP address on Capitol Hill, as captured by congress-edits, a Twitter bot that tracks Wikipedia updates from congressional IP addresses.
        
          Another policy that was breached in this case is known as biography of living persons. “BLP” was specifically cited by the Wikipedia administrator who removed the Devil’s Triangle edit from the public archives. Drafted after the 2005 John Seigenthaler biography incident, in which the esteemed journalist was the target of a hoax article claiming that he was a suspect in the JFK assassination, the gist of BLP is that editors must take special care when adding information about living persons to any Wikipedia page because it could negatively affect subjects during the course of their lives. BLP also states a presumption in favor of privacy for living people—one of many reasons why it was completely inappropriate for an anonymous Wikipedia user to add Sen. Lindsey Graham’s phone number and home address to his page earlier this week.
        
          Then there’s the policy of verifiability, which gets to an essential question: What is the Devil’s Triangle, really? The main entry points to the Bermuda Triangle, where aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared mysteriously. Alternative definitions include a sexual threesome and an episode of NCIS. Even if Brett Kavanaugh and his high school friends referred to their quarters drinking game as Devil’s Triangle, that alone would not justify adding the content to Wikipedia. Under the principle of verifiability, reputable third-party sources would also need to use the same name in their regular coverage.
        
          The edit also violated the Wikipedia principle of notability. At first, one might think that the notability standard was met because the Supreme Court confirmation hearing was a high-profile event. But notability on Wikipedia means something slightly different, requiring “significant coverage” of subjects with long-term significance. Many in the Wikipedia community are adamantly opposed to a phenomenon known as recentism—the skewing of content toward recent events. The long-term focus of core Wikipedians was illustrated by a humorous debate earlier this year about the word Tinder. Some editors felt that Tinder should direct users to the popular dating app because that’s what most people were researching, by a margin of roughly 10 to 1. But the community ultimately decided that Tinder should continue to direct to the material used to start a fire because the latter usage had more long-term significance.
        
          Most people have an intuitive sense that Wikipedia should not have an entry for Devil’s Triangle that describes the “drinking game enjoyed by friends of judge Brett Kavanaugh”—it just feels wrong for an encyclopedia. But why is it wrong? Whether it’s on-Wiki or off, we are increasingly being asked to defend basic policies and processes. Although it’s sometimes exhausting, it’s helpful to think through the underlying reasoning. To push back on so many bad faith arguments, we must know the principles and why we have them.

          Saturday Night Live returned for its 44th season this week, but fans hoping NBC’s venerable sketch show would get out of the celebrity-cameo rut it settled into last year were in for a Matt-Damon-sized disappointment. The show kicked off with a Brett Kavanaugh cold open that either promised a thrilling return to form or indulged all of SNL’s laziest comedic instincts, depending on how you felt about last year. As Kavanaugh, Damon joined Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Stiller, and Stormy Daniels in the long list of A-listers and Stormy Daniels who’ve cameoed on SNL as bit players in Trump’s orbit. Meanwhile, Rachel Dratch popped up as Senator Amy Klobuchar, a reassuring reminder that we can expect plenty of surprise appearances from former cast members, regardless of Fred Armisen’s availability. And although this wasn’t the first time Kate McKinnon played Lindsey Graham—check out this 2016 Republican debate sketch for a trip back to the pre-Baldwin days—her brief appearance makes it clear that the makeup department has laid in plenty of prosthetic jowls for the long winter ahead. Continuity with change:
        
          But whatever work the cold open is doing to set Saturday Night Live’s tone, it doesn’t accomplish anywhere near as much as a satire, probably because Kavanaugh is his own caricature. The writers pick up the paranoid style in Kavanaugh’s thinking by giving Damon this line:
        
          But that is actually less paranoid than what Kavanaugh said. Damon’s Kavanaugh names actual people who he alleges have done specific, verifiable things, while the genuine Kavanaugh blames dark, shadowy forces:
        
          That’s just unimprovable. Damon’s best moments come when he gets weepy remembering workout sessions with Mark Judge, P.J., Squi, Donkey-Dong Doug, Handsy Hank, and Gang Rape Greg, but even here, he has the same basic problem with the source material. A Supreme Court nominee named “Brett” who had friends nicknamed “Squi” and “PJ” when they were all in prep school together is not the kind of gag that can be improved by adding “Donkey-Dong Doug” to the mix. Kavanaugh, like Trump himself, is a cruel but perfect joke the universe is making about America. No one can make this any funnier than it already is.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-fbi-investigation-limited-trump-swetnick-ramirez-blasey-ford.html,"
          Following Senator Jeff Flake’s dramatic call for a week-long FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the entire nation speculated as to what shape that investigation might take. Who should the FBI talk to? How would the logistics work? How easy would it be to buy a calendar from 1982 on eBay? On Saturday, NBC News gave us our first glimpse at the answer: The FBI seems to be taking a fast-moving, fluid approach to the case, in the sense that their investigation will assume the shape of whatever bullshit-shaped container Donald Trump pours it into.
        
          According to multiple sources, the White House has given the bureau a list of witnesses it is permitted to interview and topics it is permitted to ask about. Christine Blasey Ford and Debbie Ramirez’s allegations will be investigated; Julie Swetnick’s will not. What’s more, the FBI will not be investigating Kavanaugh’s college drinking or the way he described it in his testimony, despite the fact that his Yale classmates are coming out of the woodwork to tell the country that he was a “sloppy drunk” who is lying about his past. Kavanaugh has categorically denied all of the sexual assault allegations, and has also testified under oath that the phrase “Beach Week Ralph Club—Biggest Contributor” in his high school yearbook referred to his difficulties with spicy food.
        
          The White House’s constraints on the investigation will have real consequences when it comes to the legitimacy of whatever information it digs up. For example, while the FBI will question Mark Judge, who Christine Blasey Ford alleges was in the room when Kavanaugh assaulted her, they won’t be allowed to seek corroborating evidence like Judge’s employment records. (Ford recalled running into Judge at his job at Safeway after the assault; determining when he was working there might help put a date on the party she describes.) It’s also unclear what recourse would be open to investigators if one of the witnesses they are allowed to interview gives them a promising lead to follow up on. This sounds very different from the investigation GOP senators initially described:
        
          It also sounds very different from the investigation Donald Trump described on Saturday, about an hour after the NBC story broke:
        
          The FBI referred questions about the investigation to the White House, where spokesperson Raj Shah denied micromanaging the investigation, telling NBC News that “the scope and duration has been set by the Senate.” This is true, in the sense that the Senate said that the investigation must “be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today,” but doesn’t square with the White House apparently making the unilateral determination that Swetnick’s claims were not credible. It also doesn’t square with their decision that “allegations against the nominee” refers only to sexual assault, and not allegations that Beach Week Ralph Club’s biggest contributor might have perjured himself on national television as to the exact nature of his contributions to the Beach Week Ralph Club. It’s too early to draw any definitive conclusions, but it’s beginning to look like Jeff Flake might have been wrong to trust Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell to do the right thing!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/trump-officially-launches-fbi-investigation-ford-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-allegations.html,"
          Following a dramatic reversal at the conclusion of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s day-long exploration of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegation, the committee, spurred by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake’s change of heart on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, agreed, in principle, to allow a one-week FBI investigation into the matter. Suddenly lacking the votes to ram through their guy, the GOP Senate leadership acquiesced to the demand. But would Trump, a president accused of multiple sexual assaults order an FBI investigation into a Supreme Court nominee accused of multiple sexual assaults? No matter what course the Senate charted, the executive branch needed to formally request the probe, meaning Trump himself would need to order the investigation by an institution he rails against almost daily in an effort to discredit its investigation into his Russia-links.
        
          On Friday afternoon, the White House had Trump signed off on the investigation and later Friday evening Trump tweeted the investigation was underway.
        
          The exact parameters of the federal inquiry remain vague, although Trump, like his fellow Republicans in the Senate, is calling for an investigation “limited in scope and completed in less than one week.” The Judiciary Committee said the probe would cover “current credible allegations,” which appears to mean the accusations made by Ford and, the New York Times reports, the claims made by former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to her at a party in college. (Here’s a list compiled by Slate of people involved in the incident that any credible FBI investigation would need to interview.)
        
          In response to Trump’s order, the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination out of committee by a 11-to-10 party-line vote Friday night. But what comes next remains fluid and the nature of the investigation remains negotiable. Attorneys for Ford, for example, signaled support for the investigation that had originally been part of her conditions for participating in the confirmation hearing, but said that “no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation.” That seems unlikely with Republicans committed to completing the nomination—one way or another—before next month’s midterms potentially upend the balance of power in Washington. Kavanaugh, as expected, said he would cooperate with what Republicans are calling a “supplemental” background check; Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI background checks as part of his roles in the White House and judiciary. “I’ve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate,” Kavanaugh said.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/joe-fain-washington-state-senator-rape-investigation.html,"
          A woman who said she was inspired watching Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday has publicly accused a prominent Washington state legislator of raping her 11 years ago.
        
          Candace Faber, in a tweet sent out Thursday afternoon, alleged that moderate Republican Joe Fain, the minority floor leader of the state senate, assaulted in her in 2007 on the night she graduated from a master’s program at Georgetown University.
        
          Fain has denied the allegation and called for an investigation, according to the Associated Press.
        
          In a statement published late Thursday night on the west coast, Faber repeated that she was “inspired by Dr. Ford’s courage” but said the decision to name Fain felt “like a decision I have been building up to for a long time.”
        
          Faber claims she has spoken with people about her assault, and she has written about a sexual assault by an unnamed person. She said in her statement that she withheld his name even in private conversations. She wrote:
        
          In an earlier post published on Medium, Faber described walking back with a man to his hotel, after she had met him at the Capitol and the two had been drinking, dancing, and kissing. In her account, he pins her to the bed, pulling down her dress with enough force that the straps tore. She wrote that she tried to push him away with her foot.
        
          In the essay, she says that after the man raped her, she contemplated going to a hospital but decided that the questions she would face would be too difficult.
        
          According to KUOW in Seattle, Faber had to leave a job in Seattle city government in 2017 because of a mental health breakdown. She told KUOW that her mental health issues stemmed from several traumas, including the rape.
        
          She told KUOW that she met Fain in 2007, when she was graduating from a Georgetown master’s program in foreign service. She scheduled a tour of congressional buildings for her parents and found their way into a reception, where she met Fain. She invited him to a party after her graduation ceremony.
        
          Faber’s parents and colleagues told KUOW that she told them about the rape. Her mother said she identified the assailant as Fain after Trump’s election in 2016.
        
          According to the AP, a spokeswoman for Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he “believes this is a very serious allegation that unquestionably deserves a full investigation by law enforcement officials.” The statute of limitations for serious sex crimes in Washington, D.C., is 15 years, according to the AP.

          By the end of Thursday’s Senate hearings over Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, Senate Republicans had engineered a shrewd narrative. Ford wasn’t lying, GOP senators insisted, but she must have confused Kavanaugh for someone else. The Supreme Court nominee was just too convinced of his own innocence, too swell a guy to commit such a heinous crime. In fact, Republicans insisted that Kavanaugh himself was the real victim—a reframing that the nominee all but demanded in his defiant and seething opening statement. If you vote against me, Kavanaugh declared, you are smearing me with a false claim, assassinating my character at the bidding of Democrats, “the Clintons,” and “left-wing opposition groups.”
        
          When Sen. Jeff Flake, the Republican swing vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced on Friday morning that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, this stratagem seemed to have succeeded. And then, as Flake walked to the committee room to cast his vote, something extraordinary happened: Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher confronted him in an elevator and condemned his decision. Both women spoke of their own history of sexual assault and explained what Flake’s vote meant to them. “I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me,” Gallagher said, holding open the elevator door so Flake would hear her. “I didn’t tell anyone, and you’re telling all women that they don’t matter.”
        
          A few hours later, after conferring with a handful of centrist senators, Flake announced a surprise: While he would vote Kavanaugh out of committee, he would not support a final vote on the Senate floor unless the FBI could have one week to look into Ford’s accusations. It’s difficult to know if Archila and Gallagher’s dramatic confrontation changed Flake’s mind, though the senator did note the impact of “interactions” he had with people “walking around the Capitol.” But it’s entirely plausible that their fervent pleas—which swept through social media Friday—helped to undo the damage of Kavanaugh’s self-pitying testimony, moving victims back to the center of the debate where they belong.
        
          In a sense, Archila and Gallagher picked up where Ford left off on Friday. The Kavanaugh confirmation has become a pivotal moment in the #MeToo movement, pitting the allegations of a few women against the flat denial of an incredibly powerful man. It poses the question of whether America’s lawmakers are willing to believe these women—and, in particular, Ford’s highly credible testimony—or defer to the furious entitlement of the man they’ve accused. Ford’s appeal on Thursday was not political but moral: The Senate must know how Kavanaugh “damaged my life,” she said, and “take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed.”
        
          Archila and Gallagher took this statement a step further. Ford expressly declined to oppose Kavanaugh’s confirmation, telling the committee: “It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court.” Archila and Gallagher told Flake what it would mean for sexual assault survivors if he voted to confirm the nominee. “What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court,” Archila, executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, told Flake. “This is not tolerable.” She continued:
        
          Gallagher was equally forceful. “You’re telling me my assault doesn’t matter,” she said.
        
          Finally, the subtext of the Ford hearing burst into the open in the halls of the Senate, where Flake could not ignore it. He could no longer walk into the committee room and insist that, in light of all the “doubt,” he couldn’t bear to sully Kavanaugh’s good name by voting against him. The real stakes of the vote had been laid bare—the stakes for survivors across the country, and for Ford herself. As Archila told Flake, this isn’t just about the Supreme Court. “This is,” she said, “about the future of our country.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-fbi-background-check.html,"
          On Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination to the full Senate on a party-line vote. In a surprise move, the committee also requested that the FBI conduct a supplemental background investigation of “current credible allegations against the nominee” after Sen. Jeff Flake seemed to come to a last-minute agreement with Democrats that he would not vote for Kavanaugh on the Senate floor without the probe being renewed. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that President Donald Trump had accepted this request and ordered the investigation reopened.
        
          The demand came one day after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school in the early 1980s, which was followed by calls from the American Bar Association and the Dean of Yale Law School for a new investigation. Democrats on the committee spent much of Thursday’s hearing practically begging their Republican colleagues and Kavanaugh to request a reopening of the probe, with the judge repeatedly demurring and committee chairman Chuck Grassley arguing that he didn’t control the FBI.
        
          The investigation carries pitfalls for those who wish to see Judge Kavanaugh confirmed following his highly public raging against what he claimed was a broad Democratic conspiracy to bring down his nomination and his often untruthful testimony. But it could also be a boon to those Kavanaugh supporters, offering the slimmest patina of legitimacy to a Supreme Court nominee who spent the previous day essentially telling half of the country to go to hell.
        
          Ford, and a pair of other women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault or abuse, have all asked that their allegations be investigated by the FBI. It is unclear, though, what the scope of the probe will be. There were multiple reports on Friday that the parameters would be established by the FBI. Presumably that was done to mollify Flake, along with some combination of Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Joe Manchin, who all praised the move and are currently undecided. The only public parameters established so far were that the investigation would be completed “no later than one week from” Friday and be “limited to current credible allegations.”
        
          Again, if it is conducted properly, the investigation could present pitfalls for the nomination. Ford’s testimony was highly credible and Kavanaugh’s was full of evasions and outright holes. While both have answered questions before the Senate on Thursday, they will now have to face questions from putatively impartial investigators who won’t have five-minute time limits to their questioning. Other key witnesses, including Kavanaugh’s close high school friend and alleged accomplish, Mark Judge, will also presumably be questioned. Lying to the FBI is a federal crime.
        
          Judge, through his lawyer, agreed on Friday to cooperate with any law enforcement probe so long as it is done “confidentially.” (Given that he is being accused of a separate state felony without a statute of limitations, that may be an unrealistic expectation.) During his testimony on Thursday, Kavanaugh insisted that Judge shouldn’t be made to testify, citing previous illness and drug problems. Just before the announcement was made, Sen. Ted Cruz argued that there would be no point in interviewing Judge because he would merely plead the fifth, a seeming acknowledgment that he is perhaps not the most reliable character witness in the world.
        
          The FBI will be able to go down other lines of inquiries as well, though, such as interrogating the facts of Kavanaugh’s 1982 calendar and looking at floor plans for local homes to see if they match the description of those very specifically detailed by Ford in her testimony. “They’re going to sit down with all of those individuals, they’re going to have the existing factual record of what’s already been pulled together from the hearing and documentation of what’s been submitted in past testimony, and they’re going to pick through the story a bit,” said attorney Bradley P. Moss, who works on security clearances for government employees and sometimes for political appointees.
        
          “There’s going to be an interesting question of whether and to what extent they’re going to really harp on details, like they would in a normal vetting, or if this is going to be more of a ‘checking the box’ type of investigation,” he added.
        
          In a criminal investigation, FBI investigators would be able to look through those large number of discrepancies in Kavanaugh’s Congressional testimony to verify or falsify claims, and test whether he committed perjury. That doesn’t appear to be this type of investigation, though.
        
          This points to the pitfalls for those who oppose Kavanaugh’s nomination. It’s very possible that the investigation turns up little that adds to the factual record, or that whatever it turns up with be revealed behind closed doors and subject to partisan spin. If that happens, we’ll be right back where we started in one week, with the fate of the court and the country to be decided by fewer than a handful of Senators.

          It’s almost like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake didn’t enjoy getting screamed at by sexual assault survivors.
        
          That’s what happened as he was cornered in a Senate office building elevator shortly after announcing that he would support Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, citing a lack of corroborating evidence for Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations. Over the course of the next couple of hours in the committee hearing room, Flake sat glumly as one Democrat after another delegitimized Kavanaugh’s pending advancement: Not all stones had been unturned in trying to get to the bottom of what happened in 1982. Very few of them, really. If Kavanaugh made it to the Supreme Court before whatever other evidence that could be collected was collected, there would always be a shroud of illegitimacy hanging over him, and the country further ripped apart.
        
          So Flake huddled with Judiciary Committee Democrats in the committee antechamber to cut a deal, emerging to say that he would not feel “comfortable” voting to confirm Kavanaugh on the Senate floor without an FBI investigation of Ford’s allegations, lasting no longer than one week. He did, however, agree to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination out of committee.
        
          Flake spoke like someone who had the numbers to block Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and sure enough, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said shortly after the hearing that she supported Flake’s position. Mitch McConnell can count, and that left him with, at best, 49 votes. McConnell must not have seen it as a bluff, because a couple of hours after the hearing disbanded, an “accord” was struck.
        
          “The Senate Judiciary Committee will request that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental FBI background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court,” a statement from Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley read. “The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today.” The Senate opened debate on the nomination on Friday, but McConnell, according to Flake, won’t set up a vote to end debate while the week-long investigation is pending.
        
          Most Republicans are surely furious at the additional delay, but they should direct that ire towards their leaders’ impulse to rush in the first place. If Grassley had just requested an FBI investigation early last week when Democrats requested it, it would have been completed by now and the nominee’s fate not conditional on a retiring Arizonan’s crisis of conscience.
        
          It would be nice to believe that the FBI will either find corroborating evidence or won’t, and that the Senate will coolly look at it, arrive at a reasonable consensus conclusion, vote 100-0 in whichever direction the evidence points them, and disband until after the midterms (or, preferably, forever).
        
          Now let’s chart a realistic course. The FBI updates the background file. Democrats claim either that the investigation was prematurely cut off by an artificial deadline or that the file contains explosive new evidence that calls for further investigation and hearings. Republican leaders say that there’s still no corroboration and Judge Kavanaugh is a good church man, so eat it, and set up the vote. Democrats lose their minds and once again beg Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski not to support Kavanaugh and this outrageous process. After another week that feels like 100 years, we’re likely to end up right where we started.

          Sen. Lindsey Graham’s public fury dissipated Friday afternoon, however briefly.
        
          After unleashing one television tirade after another for the previous 24 hours, claiming that Democratic calls for the FBI to investigate the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were nothing more than a partisan ploy to smear Kavanaugh and derail his nomination, Graham finally relented after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake lent his name to the cause.
        
          “I think the people in the country who are going to feel differently a week from now, you can probably put in a phone booth,” Graham told reporters after Flake secured a handshake agreement with GOP leaders to delay a final floor vote to allow the FBI to conduct a time-limited investigation. “However, if Jeff feels better about it, I feel better about it.”
        
          Graham’s about-face wasn’t a shock. Republicans needed Flake’s vote to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination out of the Judiciary Committee on Friday, and they’ll need it again, along with other moderate Republicans like Sen. Lisa Murkowski, to confirm Kavanaugh. Graham and the rest of the GOP just can’t afford to alienate Flake or anyone else in their own party. Still, Graham’s abrupt change of tune—from Democrats should be ashamed of themselves to My fellow Republican makes a fair point—was nonetheless stunning.
        
          A quick refresher.
        
          Early Thursday afternoon, only moments after Christine Blasey Ford finished testifying, Graham stepped in front of the cameras outside the hearing room to deliver a four-plus-minute rant. “All I can say is that we’re 40-something days away from the election, and their goal—not Miss Ford’s goal—is to lay this past the midterms so they can win the Senate and never allow Trump to fill the seat,” Graham said. He added: “That’s the facts I’m left with—a nice lady who has come forward to tell a hard story that’s uncorroborated. And [if] this is enough, God help anybody else that gets nominated.”
        
          A few hours later, Graham offered a repeat performance inside the hearing room, a moment that marked an inflection point for many Senate Republicans, who up until then had largely ceded their time to Rachel Mitchell, a veteran sex crimes prosecutor the GOP had flown in to do the questioning. “What you want to do,” Graham told Democrats on the panel, as Kavanaugh sat in the hot seat, “is destroy this guy’s life, hold open this seat, and hope you win in 2020.” (After Graham spoke, no Republican on the panel gave their time to Mitchell again.)
        
          The affirmations from Trump world were enough to make you wonder if that was Graham’s intended audience the whole time:
        
          Graham then offered up an encore performance that same evening on Fox News. “I am now more convinced than ever that he didn’t do it, that he’s the right guy to be on the court, that Ms. Ford has got a problem, and destroying Judge Kavanaugh’s life won’t fix her problem,” he told Sean Hannity.
        
          A night’s sleep didn’t change Graham’s mind, either. On Friday morning, as the judiciary panel was getting ready to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, Graham offered up another indignant lecture, this one lasting a quarter-hour. “I know I’m a single white male from South Carolina and I’ve been told I should shut up,” Graham began, “but I will not shut up.” As Republicans did several times on Thursday, Graham then used an old Joe Biden quote—misleadingly—to suggest that an FBI investigation would be worthless. “This has never been about the truth, this has been about delay and destruction,” he said, adding later: “If I am chairman next year … I’m gonna remember this. There’s the process before Kavanaugh and the process after Kavanaugh.”
        
          The anger and warnings, though, were conspicuously absent a few hours later, after Flake secured a “gentlemen’s and women’s agreement,” in the hot-mic words of Chairman Chuck Grassley, to have the FBI perform a time-limited investigation into Ford’s claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school. “Thirty-five years ago—you know what you know and have heard what you are going to hear,” Graham told reporters. “Having said that, this is called democracy.” He continued: “This is Jeff Flake being very sincere and what he is trying to do—I respect the hell out of this—is trying to get some Democrats to buy in.”

          At this moment of feverishly intense partisanship, it takes a great deal of courage to tiptoe away from your own tribe. Sen. Jeff Flake has not yet announced that he is willing to part for good; in the end, he may yet betray his professed principles and cast his vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh. And yet, we should not underestimate how much strength it took for him to demand an investigation into Christine Blasey Ford’s serious allegations of sexual assault and delay the judge’s confirmation by at least a week. For now, he has proved to be one of the few people in the Senate—and perhaps one of the few in the whole country—who have insisted on taking Ford’s allegations seriously even though he actually shares most of Kavanaugh’s judicial views.
        
          For the sake of our country, all of us should now hope that the FBI manages to uncover conclusive evidence that either supports or dispels Ford’s accusations. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely. So the big risk we now face is that the same hell we have lived through for the past 48 hours will be repeated in even more farcical form next week. And that is why it’s very important to use this time to reflect seriously on how judicious people—and perhaps especially senators like Flake who profess to be conscientious conservatives—should vote if they have not made up their mind about the allegations.
        
          It is painfully obvious that most Republican senators will vote to confirm Kavanaugh if the allegations against him are anything short of iron-clad; indeed, one shocking poll suggests that a majority of Republicans voters, and nearly half of evangelicals, would support his confirmation even if they did believe that he is guilty. It is also obvious that most Democrats will vote against his confirmation even in the unlikely case that the FBI should somehow manage to disprove Ford’s allegations; indeed, Kavanaugh’s extreme views on executive power provide a strong reason for any defender of liberal democracy to oppose his nomination. And yet, I think that one very important consideration has largely been overlooked.
        
          Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that Kavanaugh is an innocent man. If that’s the case, the raw anger he displayed during Thursday’s confirmation hearing is certainly understandable. While we might wish for a public figure to keep his poise even when his reputation is being impugned, it is perfectly human to lose your countenance under such circumstances.
        
          But even under that charitable interpretation, Kavanaugh’s performance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee makes him eminently unfit to sit on the highest court of the land.
        
          A justice on the Supreme Court has to rule on a whole host of issues that are of huge partisan significance: If he is confirmed, he will have to settle substantive questions of public policy—from abortion rights to the health care mandate—on which Democrats and Republicans have hugely differing preferences. Just as importantly, he will also help to set the parameters that are supposed to ensure that Democrats and Republicans can appeal for the votes of their fellow citizens on fair terms.
        
          But how can somebody who has accused Democrats of a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” be seen as impartial when he rules on a gerrymandering case that could deliver a huge advantage to Republicans? How can somebody who describes serious allegations of sexual assault as “revenge on behalf of the Clintons” be expected to give both sides a fair hearing if the outcome of a presidential election should once again be litigated in front of the Supreme Court? And how can somebody who denounces the “frenzy on the left” to derail his nomination be trusted to ensure that the left’s most vocal enemy, Donald Trump, does not overstep the bounds of his constitutional authority?
        
          Because of Mitch McConnell’s refusal to hold hearings on the confirmation of Merrick Garland during the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency, the current composition of the Supreme Court is already tainted. Now, the confirmation of as nakedly partisan a jurist as Kavanaugh would go a long way toward destroying whatever remains of the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. And this would not only tank the trust Americans have in the last branch of government that has, according to polls, consistently been more popular than secondhand car salesmen; it also significantly raises the likelihood that Democrats will engage in yet another round of tit for tat.
        
          Precisely because partisans need to be able to trust that courts can enforce the rules for fair political competition between them and their adversaries, attempts by a political party to change the ideological makeup of the judiciary are extremely dangerous to the survival of democratic institutions. That’s why (direct or indirect) court-packing schemes have been key elements of the authoritarian takeovers in Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela. And it’s also why the current governments in Poland and Hungary are playing constitutional hardball to ensure that judges they appoint command a majority on the most important courts in their respective countries.
        
          There can therefore be little doubt that any attempt by Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, for example, by expanding its size, would be another step in a tit-for-tat spiral at whose end autocracy awaits. And yet, recent events will make it very hard for those voices within the Democratic Party that recognize this danger to prevail. If one side is so willing to abuse precedent and decency to, as Kavanaugh might put it, screw the libs, it becomes very difficult for the other side not to reciprocate in kind.
        
          This is why Kavanaugh’s confirmation would not just be a disaster in itself; it would also be a strong reason to become even more pessimistic about the future of American politics. The GOP and Trump are now more fully aligned than ever. Our country’s partisan divide is deeper than it has been in living memory. The mutual hatred and incomprehension is more acute than it has been in decades. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, it’s very, very difficult to envisage what path could possibly lead us out of this nightmare.
        
          Jeff Flake has acted with much more courage and decency than most liberals care to admit. But the responsibility that now rests on his—and Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s and Sen. Susan Collins’—shoulders is even greater than he might realize.

          President Trump called Christine Blasey Ford a “very fine woman” and “certainly a very credible witness” on Friday, a day after Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her allegation of sexual assault.
        
          According to reporters at the White House, before the president’s meeting with Chile’s president, Trump declined to weigh in on Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation, saying that senators must do “what makes them comfortable” and that he had no message for them.
        
          The President also said he would rely on the advice of the Judiciary Committee as to whether to reopen an FBI background investigation into Kavanaugh .
        
          “I’m going to rely on all of the people, including Sen. Grassley, who is doing a very good job,” Trump said.
        
          Shortly before Trump’s comments, the Senate Judiciary Committee had voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who had been considered one of the potential swing votes, called for a one-week delay on the final Senate vote to allow the FBI to investigate the sexual assault and misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh—a request that appears to have been agreed upon. According to a statement later released by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee will ask the Trump administration to order the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation. The investigation would be limited to a week and focus only on allegations that have already been made.
        
          When reporters then asked about his thoughts on Ford’s testimony in the first half of Thursday’s hearing, Trump called her a “very fine woman” and said her testimony was “very compelling.” But he added, “I thought that Brett’s testimony likewise was really something that I hadn’t seen before.” He continued: “Incredible. It was an incredible moment in the history of our country.”
        
          Trump continued to stand by Kavanaugh, as he has consistently since the allegations were made public. When a reporter asked him if he had considered replacing Kavanaugh, Trump said, “not even a little bit.”

          All day Thursday, I had an itchy feeling, as if I needed something to occupy my hands while listening to Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testify. I made an elaborate lunch and refreshed Twitter. The artists who created the tributes below channeled that same nervous energy into fan art for Ford.
        
          On Instagram and Twitter, news photos of Ford being sworn in, right arm raised, were transformed—Ford with blooming flowers, radiating behind her head like a nimbus; Ford against a stark red background, with “This is what bravery looks like” outlined above her head in script. Some drew Ford with a phalanx of women behind her. Some created dual portraits of Ford and Anita Hill: two professional women, serious in their poise. And at least one drew Ford’s face in a more intimate close-up, pulling her glasses down her nose while making a point—a characteristic gesture that reminded me of professors I’ve known.
        
          Anita Hill wrote in her 1997 memoir, Speaking Truth to Power, that during the Thomas hearings, she looked often at a handwritten letter she had received from a woman who identified herself as a “black female attorney” with similar professional experience. “I want you to know that you are brave,” the anonymous woman wrote. Hill wrote that she “took solace in finding a comrade” who understood her experience.
        
          I don’t know whether Christine Blasey Ford is looking at the internet right now. For her sake, I hope she has someone filtering it for her. And I hope that person shows her these tributes.

          Friday’s Senate Judiciary Committee session vote promised to determine the future of Brett Kavanagh’s Supreme Court nomination, so naturally some Americans spent their mornings attempting to call their senators and sound off. Only not all of their voices got heard—because some of the callers were greeted with full voicemail inboxes.
        
          So much for the oft-given advice to “Call your representatives!” It won’t do a whole lot of good when you can’t get through to them. The timing is particularly bad today, when voters want to talk about Kavanaugh, who faces accusations of sexual assault. But as the Outline has written, outdated technology is a persistent issue standing in the way of constituents connecting with their representatives: “Most congressional offices have only between four and seven phone lines, and their voicemail boxes close after only 100 or so messages—not a high threshold for representatives who govern thousands, if not millions, of people.”
        
          The problem is particularly annoying considering how relatively easy and inexpensive it would be to fix. We live in an age of cheap data storage. Haven’t these people ever heard of Google Voice? There are seemingly dozens of companies that offer enterprise voicemail services; congressional offices should be at least as well equipped as any corporate customer service system. They may not need abundant voicemail space on most days, but during weeks like this one—when senators’ decisions will impact the makeup of the Supreme Court for the next generation—their technological failure is also a democratic one. They should be able to receive their constituents’ voicemails. Whether the politicians would really be listening, of course, is a whole other question.

          Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court advanced on a party-line vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said he wanted a time-limited investigation into Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations before a vote of the full Senate on final passage for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
        
          “I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but no more than one week,” Flake said. “Let the FBI do an investigation limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there.”
        
          Flake’s commitment is not backed by any legislation, but instead, it seemed, is backed by a threat to withhold his vote for Kavanaugh. To be confirmed, Kavanaugh needs the votes of all the Republican senators except one, assuming no Democratic senators vote yes.
        
          Republicans on the committee quickly pointed out that Flake had no power to legislatively force an investigation and that it would have to be agreed to by leadership in the Senate. “Senator Flake has made clear what makes him comfortable on a majority floor vote, but will be up to Senators Schumer and McConnell,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership, said that Flake “maintains significant leverage” over the final vote for Kavanaugh.
        
          Whether a further investigation will happen or if the subjects of that investigation would provide any new information is, of course, unknown. “I understand witnesses may not want to discuss further,” Flake said.
        
          Update, Sept. 28, 2018, at 2:50 p.m.: Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters that she supports Flake’s demand for an FBI investigation before the final vote. If they were both to vote no on Kavanaugh, along with all the Democrats, his nomination would go down.
        
          Update, Sept. 28, 2018, at 4:04 p.m.: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced that the committee would “request that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental FBI background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.”
        
          The investigation, Grassley said, “would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/ted-cruz-mark-judge-would-take-fifth.html,"
          One of the key points of contention between Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee right now is whether a writer named Mark Judge should be called to testify about Brett Kavanaugh. Judge, a close friend of Kavanaugh’s during high school, is accused by Christine Blasey Ford of having been present in the room where Kavanaugh forced her down and attempted to rape her. Judge has said in brief written statements to the committee that he does not want to testify and does “not recall” the event described by Ford having taken place. If subpoenaed, though, Judge wouldn’t simply be able to issue a blanket denial; he’d be asked to respond to specific questions about the alleged assault and Kavanaugh’s high school conduct more broadly.
        
          Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, speaking at the Committee’s Friday meeting, said such a subpoena would be pointless because even if Judge were called to testify, he’d plead the Fifth:
        
          This is strange for Cruz to acknowledge given that he—and nearly every other Republican—are insistent that it’s been proven that no assault involving Kavanaugh and Judge ever took place, and beyond that that no party like the one Ford describes ever took place. If that’s such an established fact, then how could Judge possibly put himself in legal jeopardy by stating as much at a hearing? What potentially incriminating statement—whether an admission of a criminal act or a perjurious denial thereof—could he possibly make about an event that absolutely, definitely never took place?
        
          Of course, what Cruz might realize is that one of Kavanaugh’s 1982 calendar entries does describe a party with “Judge” that fits Ford’s description and that a passage in one of Judge’s books about working at a supermarket in the summer of 1982 matches Ford’s description of seeing him some time after the assault at a Safeway. A college ex-girlfriend of Judge’s also recently told the New Yorker that he once told her he’d been part of a group of boys that had sex with a drunk woman, though he apparently believed the sex was consensual. So there is, in fact, some reason to believe that Judge engaged in crude and possibly illegal sexual conduct while he was Kavanaugh’s close friend. And there’s thus a hypothetical possibility that Judge’s testimony—in addition to possibly undermining Kavanaugh’s denial that he ever even heard of egregious sexual misconduct taking place when he was in high school—could implicate Judge in crimes.
        
          I still can’t figure out why Ted Cruz would admit this, though! And in any case, a motion to subpoena Judge was voted down Friday morning on party lines.

          When I watched Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate on Thursday, I was impressed with her courage, but not surprised by her graciousness. “Does that work for you?” she asked the senators who were grilling her, as if she were the hostess of her own inquisition. At another point she said, “I’m used to being collegial.”
        
          It’s a graciousness I recognize from the private school world we both occupied in D.C. I went to National Cathedral School, a girls school that has much in common with Ford’s alma mater, Holton-Arms. It was drilled into us: Always say please. Don’t raise your voice. We were raised in a world of ballroom dancing classes, of country club swim meets, of handwritten thank-you notes. We were expected to be smart and athletic, polite and pretty. Eating disorders were par for the course. We were trained to be gracious. Composed. Nice. We faced enormous pressure to succeed (ace our SATs, get As at school, win field hockey games), and on top of that, we were supposed to smile.
        
          In short, it was a world that demanded performance. We had to perform for our parents, our teachers, our college interviewers, our friends. And we performed for the boys, too. We were expected to be fun, we were expected to be game. Just not too game. To be labeled a “ho” was impossible to live down. Word of the slutty girls passed from school to school quickly. And there was the perpetual humiliation of having our attractiveness rated by the boys in our circles, many of whom we counted as friends. “She’s such a box,” boys from our brother school, St. Albans, would say in my era, and we were expected to take it as a compliment. The annual St. Albans yearbook even included a “BABES” page with photos of the NCS girls deemed the most attractive. Did we protest? We did not. Worse, many of us were flattered to be on that page.
        
          We even performed for ourselves. That’s what I was reminded of when I saw Brett Kavanaugh’s calendar from 1982. You see his performance in all caps, scrawled across the second week of June: “BEACH WEEK.” He even counted the days: eight for young Brett, who went to the beach on June 5 (“Sean Feeley drives”) and returned on June 13, after spending one night at his friend Squi’s in Rehoboth. The other seven nights were presumably spent in a Saturday-to-Saturday rental house, without parental supervision, with his friends.
        
          I’m a decade younger than Brett Kavanaugh, and yet I’m sure my experience of Beach Week wasn’t so different from his. There are still stories that get passed around: the girl who got so drunk that she shat her pants in a wicker chair; the guy who pulled a gun and was later expelled from school; the girls who discovered, in the least dignified ways you can imagine, that their boyfriends were cheating on them. Beach Week was where fights broke out and relationships ended, where vomiting was celebrated as proof of a good time. It was a week of sunburns, of drinking games, of aimless wandering between paint-peeling rental houses in search of the next party.
        
          I remember Beach Week as a string of humiliations, not just for me, but for friends. And yet, despite how I hated Beach Week, I pretended it was fun. In fact, I probably wrote BEACH WEEK in giant all-caps on my calendar, too. My NCS friends and I kept planners—portable agendas, not wall calendars—with pages we decorated with colored markers. And in the numbered squares on those pages we recorded not only math tests and term paper due dates, but also social events. Looking at Brett Kavanaugh’s calendar brought it all back: the way those calendars weren’t just for personal convenience, but were, on some unconscious level, another kind of performance. “Come home from beach,” Brett Kavanaugh wrote, as if he was narrating his life. I did the same thing. “Spend the night at K’s,” my agenda probably said. Or “See Silence of the Lambs with C, S, and J.” Or “Party at L’s.” Or “Swim meet at Kenwood.” Or “Drive KC and L to Fort Reno.” Our parents were calling so many of the shots, but in our agendas, we were in charge. Look! our calendars told us. We are hard-working, we are popular, we are going places. We are normal.
        
          My personal diary was a different story. Unlike the agenda I carried at school, my diary was the repository of my secret shame, my melancholy tendencies, my writerly ambitions. I obsessed over my mistakes, my existential dread. In my diary, I was my real self, by turns vulnerable and wry. But in my planner, I performed my adolescence. In my planner, I was just another teenager excited about BEACH WEEK.
        
          And what about Brett Kavanaugh? Did the 16-year-old boy who wrote that calendar also have a secret self? A self that was anxious about the future or scared to fail? A self that lost sleep over mistakes he’d made? A self that sometimes wondered if he had a drinking problem? His belligerent testimony in the Senate reminded me of many entitled prep school boys I knew in high school. But for the sake of our country, and for the Supreme Court on which he may soon serve, I’d like to believe there is something deeper and more self-aware under all that bluster and bullying.
        
          And yet he has proudly held on to his calendars. He offered them as evidence not just of how he spent his time, but of the person he was. Look! he said. I was working out at Tobin’s. I was lifting weights at Prep. I was drinking ’skis with Squi and Judge. I was organized, I was popular. I liked beer. I went to Yale. 
        
          I know I saved my high school planners for a few years. (Perhaps our proximity to the levers of power in D.C. fostered some perverse desire to maintain them for posterity.) But as I got older, the glimpses they offered of my adolescent performance depressed me. I didn’t need to be reminded that I went to BEACH WEEK. I didn’t need to be reminded of all those years I’d been taught to be accommodating, especially to men. Christine Blasey Ford testified that six or eight weeks after Kavanaugh’s alleged assault, she ran into Kavanaugh’s friend and accomplice, Mark Judge, at Safeway. She felt uncomfortable and frightened, but she still said hello. How heartbreaking it was to hear that and recognize my young self: the girl who had to be polite, even to boys who had laughed in my face. I had the luxury of throwing my high school calendar away. Poor Christine Blasey Ford was forced to perform her adolescence again, to return to Washington and say hello to the disrespectful men on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And Brett Kavanaugh? He seemed to relish the performance of his adolescence, perhaps because he’s been playing the same role all these years.

          Late night hosts didn’t have much time to prepare after the all-day Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday. They did manage to vent their frustrations and crack some jokes about the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Jimmy Kimmel, for one, noted the national significance of the event in his monologue, comparing the spectacle to an episode of This Is Us. “People were crying in front of their televisions,” he said. “You’d have thought Milo Ventimiglia got killed by a Crock-Pot.” And that wasn’t the only TV show that Kimmel compared to the hearing: Kavanaugh’s defense of himself, which involved a lot of shouting and indignation, prompted Kimmel to show footage of Meat Loaf screaming at Gary Busey on The Celebrity Apprentice.
        
          Kimmel also had words for his longtime nemesis Donald Trump Jr., who tweeted during the hearing about Ford’s fear of flying:
        
          “I agree, you’re not a psychology professor,” responded Kimmel. “You are a dull-witted human canker sore who shoots baby hippos out of daddy’s helicopter because it’s the only way you can get an erection.”
        
          Over on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined the performance of Judiciary Committee Chairman (and “human cornbread”) Chuck Grassley. “At times, he acted like he was the one who was on trial,” said Noah. “He’s trying so hard not to look like a sexist asshole that he’s coming off as a sexist asshole.” But the most interesting part of the show was a conversation between Noah and correspondent Michael Kosta about why Republicans are so determined to keep Kavanaugh around rather than moving on to another candidate, noting that Kavanaugh’s shouty performance won him points with his base.
        
          “Evangelicals like that he defended his family,” said Kosta. “President Trump liked how he keeps getting accused of sexual assault, and senior citizens liked how he was talking so loud and clear.” But the real reason that the GOP is committing to its nominee is more of a long-term strategy, he argued. “If the Senate holds Brett Kavanaugh accountable for multiple sexual assault accusations, then they’ll have to hold the next nominee accountable, and then where does this end? You really want to live in a world where everyone is held accountable for the things they’ve done?”
        
          Stephen Colbert pointed out in his monologue that it wasn’t just people on the left who believe Ford’s testimony; even Fox News talking heads were marveling at her credibility. The Late Show also delivered a brief sketch in which Republican senators, worried about the optics of a woman being questioned about sexual assault by an all-male panel, wore wigs and pretended to be women during their questioning. The jokes are weak (“Is there any chance that during the time you allege this event occurred, you were having lady problems?”), but then again, it’s not such a far cry from the GOP ploy to bring in Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell and then have her ask Ford if “there are other things that have happened” to cause her anxiety besides the alleged assault.

          After Jeff Flake issued a statement that he would vote yes in the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh’s confirmation, he was cornered in a Senate elevator by protesters, including one woman who said, through tears, “I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. … You’re telling all women that they don’t matter, that they should just stay quiet, that if they tell you what happened to them you’re going to ignore them. That’s what happened to me, that’s what you’re telling all women in America: They don’t matter.”
        
          Flake was seen as one of the few Republicans who might actually vote against Kavanaugh; he is retiring from the Senate instead of facing re-election in November and had, after Ford’s allegations became public, asked for a hearing with her before a vote. But, as he has many times before, he eventually fell in line with his Republican colleagues.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/jeff-flake-vote-confirm-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, one of the three closely watched Republicans in the confirmation process of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, announced Friday morning that he would support Kavanaugh.
        
          In a statement, Flake described Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony as “compelling” but met with a “persuasive response from Judge Kavanaugh.” He said that he doesn’t have as much “confidence” as some of his colleagues “about what either did or did not happen in the early 1980s.”
        
          “What I do know,” the statement says, “is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law. While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate’s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the constitution’s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well.”
        
          On his way to the Judiciary Committee meeting, rape survivors directly confronted Flake.
        
          Flake’s vote all but assures the Judiciary Committee will report out Kavanaugh’s nomination favorably on Friday, and the nomination will reach the full Senate on Saturday afternoon.
        
          This now, in all likelihood, comes down to Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, both of whom would have to join all Democrats in rejecting the nomination for Kavanaugh to go down. They both remain undecided, at least publicly.

          Senate Republicans didn’t want to talk early in the afternoon on Thursday, when they were on a break from Christine Blasey Ford’s riveting testimony. Majority Whip John Cornyn tersely told reporters to get out of his way as he walked through the Senate platform. Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, who is known to offer reporters homespun quips for an hour if they can tolerate it, wouldn’t comment. The best any Republican members of the Judiciary Committee could do was some version of “I’m continuing to watch the testimony.”
        
          The pursed lips were understandable: Ford’s flawless testimony was killing their Supreme Court nominee in real time. When she finished about an hour later, Sen. Lindsey Graham’s televised meltdown over the Democratic “ambush” encapsulated the general feeling within the GOP.
        
          About six hours later, though, after an irate stem-winder from Brett Kavanaugh that appeared to catch Judiciary Committee Democrats off guard, Republicans felt back on track. When Graham, who put on his own show of rage during the hearing, entered the GOP conference’s 7:15 meeting to discuss it all, he was greeted with applause.
        
          And so, the most wrenching day I’ve ever witnessed on Capitol Hill ended about the same way that it began: with Republican leaders confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed, even if they don’t have the votes just yet.
        
          “[Kavanaugh] made it clear that he was willing to stake his credibility, his reputation, and his family on a categorical denial,” a convinced Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Republican leadership, told me afterwards.
        
          “There’s still no corroborating evidence,” Sen. John Thune, the No. 3 Republican, told reporters. This was among the GOP senators’ favorite talking points. Never mind that they themselves had blocked that corroborating evidence—from subpoenaed witnesses or an outside investigation—from being gathered. Republicans intentionally set up a he-said-she-said, and unsurprisingly they are going with their guy.
        
          “He’s going to be confirmed,” Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch told me. “And he should be.”
        
          I asked him if he had any doubts about Kavanaugh during Ford’s testimony.
        
          “No,” he said. “No, I think she’s sincere. I didn’t have any problem with that. I liked her. But she’s just sincerely wrong.”
        
          Democratic aides afterwards all agreed that Ford was as good as they could have imagined, but they differed on Kavanaugh’s performance. Some thought he came off as far too angry and unstable. But others observed it the way I did: Anger was his only shot, and he may have pulled it off. It was what he needed to do to galvanize Republicans behind him, positioning himself against a ruthless Democratic smear machine. As his observation about Democrats seeking “revenge” on behalf of the Clintons—still can’t believe he said that—showed so clearly, he’s a Republican operative at heart. He needed to make it impossible for any sitting Republican to  abandon the base.
        
          So did he?
        
          It still comes down to Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Jeff Flake. The last of that trio is a member of the Judiciary Committee, but aside from the single minute he took during Kavanaugh’s testimony to make an observation about how there would always be “doubt” surrounding the nominee’s confirmation process—no kidding, Jeff—he kept his comments to himself.
        
          Murkowski and Collins were in witness protection all day, cooped up in the unmarked “hideaways” senators maintain in the Capitol building away from their formal offices. I failed to uncover either critical Republican senator during numerous strolls through the winding basement complex that I took throughout the day, but found Collins’ spokeswoman and asked if her boss would be coming through too.
        
          “You wish,” was all she said.
        
          After the hearing, CNN reported that Collins, Murkowski, Flake, and conservative Democrat Joe Manchin were huddled together to talk it over. Politico reported, too, that Manchin, Collins, Murkowski, and Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly would be voting as a bloc, one way or another. That doesn’t make much practical difference: If Republicans have the votes on their own, it’s always been a possibility that another Democrat or two will join them, but Democrats won’t save the nomination if Murkowski and Collins vote no.
        
          Murkowski, leaving the Capitol, said that she wanted to “go home, have dinner, and have a chance to think about all that’s gone on today.” Neither she nor Collins will have to make a decision until Saturday, when the first procedural vote is scheduled to go to the Senate floor. Flake, however, will have to make one by tomorrow morning when the committee meets to consider the nomination. Even if Flake sides with the Democrats, Kavanaugh could still get a floor vote, but a dramatic Flake vote against the nominee in committee could pave the way for another defector too.
        
          Kavanaugh’s performance, though, ensured that the entire Republican apparatus will be working Flake into the morning to keep him from doing that. And his history of resisting that pressure isn’t so great.

          After a tumultuous day of testimony from Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, the question remains: how much did it move the needle when it comes to crucial senators’ votes on confirmation? Republicans appear to believe Kavanaugh—and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee—did enough to keep the nomination alive, despite a morning of Ford’s testimony that looked like it could be the end of the Trump nominee’s bid for the Supreme Court. On Thursday evening, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said the Judiciary Committee would follow through with its scheduled vote Friday, which will then be followed by a pair of procedural votes on Saturday and Monday, and a final vote on confirmation in the full Senate Tuesday. “We’re still talking through those issues and I’m optimistic we’ll get to confirmation,” Cornyn said.
        
          With the Senate divided 51-49 to the Republicans, that means Democrats would need to have the entire caucus vote against confirmation along with a pair of Republicans. Over the course of Christine Blasey Ford’s sudden, unexpected involvement in the nomination process, four senators have emerged as potential swing votes on Kavanaugh and his Supreme Court aspirations: Susan Collins (R-Maine), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). In addition, Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), both facing tough reelection bids in states Trump won handily. If either of those two decamped, it would be virtually impossible for Democrats to stop Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
        
          Where does everyone stand? Well, following the day of testimony, Collins, Flake, Murkowski, and Manchin met, but didn’t give any indication of where the stood on their votes.
        
          Stay tuned.

          Hundreds of protesters gathered on the Senate side of the Capitol on Thursday as the Senate Judiciary Committee heard from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault. They arrived bearing signs and ponchos in the early morning and persisted well into the afternoon, undeterred by the day’s rain.
        
          They lay red daisies, white carnations, and roses on the steps of the Supreme Court in honor of Kavanaugh’s accusers—Ford, Julie Swetnick, and Deborah Ramirez. Several notes accompanied the flowers—“Believe survivors,” one read. Chants echoed in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, where the hearing was being held. “We believe Christine Ford, we believe Anita Hill,” the crowd yelled.
        
          Many were there to protest Kavanaugh, but others were more motivated by a desire to show their support for Ford. Several said they were survivors of sexual assault themselves.
        
          “I’m a survivor. It meant a lot to me to support [Ford],” Laura O’Grady said. “We deserve the respect of being heard, though we aren’t having even that.”
        
          O’Grady said Ford’s case seemed even worse than that of Anita Hill, the woman who accused then–Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991 of workplace sexual harassment. She also testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          “For Anita Hill, [the committee] stopped the process and reopened the case with the FBI,” O’Grady explained. “But then with Ford, they already made plans before she even spoke. … They are ready to vote on Friday.”
        
          Counter-protesters showed up as well, though they were significantly smaller in number.
        
          “Ford doesn’t have credibility. Why did she wait 30 years?” Lourdes Washington, a professor from New Orleans, said. Washington stood outside the Dirksen Senate Office building with a few others who agreed Kavanaugh should be confirmed. “She’s been waiting all these years. It happened 30 years ago but these people, they whine, and they cry.”
        
          Washington said she was also a survivor but doesn’t understand why Ford has come out after decades. “You move on,” Washington said. “I was raped when I was 13, but I put closure. I continued my education, I’m happy.”
        
          Most women felt that it was normal for Ford to have kept her silence.
        
          “I think that the fact that it happened 35 years ago… [Ford] was 15 and it was early 80s,” Abby Bolt of Baltimore said. “So I understand—it happened to many women. At the time, there wasn’t much you can do. Speak up to whom?”
        
          Some chose not to watch the hearing because they worried it would be too traumatizing.
        
          “I read her statements on paper and I thought it should be much more powerful when she speaks out loud,” said Susan Markham of Washington, D.C.“I don’t think I could have stood the woman prosecutor speaking to Dr. Ford.”
        
          Regardless of the results, protesters said they were inspired by Ford’s decision to come forward.
        
          “I’m really proud of Dr. Ford,” Luna Robledo said, and then addressed a statement at Ford. “Thank you, you look amazing, and I believe you.”

          As Brett Kavanaugh disputed Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual assault on Thursday, he repeatedly cited evidence that he claims is exculpatory, provided by Christine Blasey Ford’s own high school friend, Leland Keyser.
        
          Keyser is one of several people who Ford said attended the social gathering in which Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her. Kavanaugh repeatedly referenced Keyser’s statement during his testimony. It was one of his strongest points of defense—and he returned to that assertion accordingly, bringing it up several times throughout the hours of questioning. Here are a few of those instances:
        
          In reality, though, Kavanaugh’s characterization is misleading. It positions Keyser as a witness in his favor, while in reality she said that she believes Ford.
        
          “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh, and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford,” Keyser’s lawyer told the Washington Post.
        
          In instances where Kavanaugh said she “did not recall” the party, he was accurately representing her statements. But in other instances, where he said she “refuted” the story, he was not. And, as the Post also reported, Keyser said in a brief interview that she believed Ford’s account.
        
          When Ford was questioned about Keyser’s statement that she didn’t remember the party, Ford responded that she was not surprised, as her friend, unlike her, was not assaulted at the party. “It was a very unremarkable party,” she said. “It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing happened to them.”
        
          One Democratic senator did finally challenge Kavanaugh on his interpretation of Keyser’s statement. Near the end of Kavanaugh’s questioning, the nominee again brought up the evidence from a “long-term friend.” Cory Booker interrupted him.
        
          “Ms. Keyser said she doesn’t remember the night in question,” he said. “But she also said she believes Dr. Ford.”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-credibility.html,"
          In her testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Blasey Ford was highly credible. That’s not because she was certain of everything she said. It’s because she wasn’t.
        
          Ford resolved many doubts about her sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Why didn’t she tell her story until 2012? Because that’s when, during a renovation, she had to explain to her husband why she wanted a second front door on their house. (As a result of the attack, she said she felt unsafe with only one exit.) Why had she talked only to congressional Democrats? Because her congresswoman was a Democrat. Why didn’t Ford’s friend, Leland Keyser, recall being at the house party where the assault allegedly happened? Because Keyser wasn’t in the room where it happened, so to her, the party was unmemorable.
        
          Ford’s strongest asset was her trustworthiness. She earned it by not overselling her case. She was frank with the committee about fatigue, the passage of time, and other factors that impaired her recollection. And she was honest about what she didn’t know. Ford said she couldn’t be sure which of the two boys—Kavanaugh or his friend Mark Judge—had initially pushed her into the bedroom where the assault happened. That’s because the push came from behind. She said she didn’t know who had paid for her polygraph or how that cost would ultimately be covered. When she was asked whether anyone had spoken to congressional staffers on her behalf, she said it was possible. If she didn’t know something, she said she didn’t know.
        
          She also used external evidence, when it was available, to re-examine her recollections and clarify what was true. At several points, she checked written records or consulted her attorneys to sort out dates or details. Rather than guess, she offered to look things up. Where her memory was unclear, she pointed to checkable information—Judge’s employment dates at Safeway, her location in a Walgreens parking lot during phone calls—to nail down where and when things happened.
        
          Unlike Kavanaugh, who has repeatedly mischaracterized the statements of alleged witnesses—Ford’s story, he falsely told the committee, was “refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers”—Ford examined her own answers as she spoke and corrected them when she saw errors. At one point, after saying she hadn’t spoken recently to people involved in the case, she corrected herself, noting that she had spoken to Keyser. At another point, after describing a trip in which she had come “here,” she stepped in to clarify that she meant Delaware, not Washington.
        
          Ford was frank—far more frank than Democrat senators have been—about political considerations in her decision to come forward. She stated bluntly that Kavanaugh’s emergence as a likely Supreme Court nominee had driven her to act. She wasn’t saying that she would make up such a story. She was saying that the cost to the country of having a predator on the Supreme Court had come to outweigh her fear of going public with a painful story she knew to be true. She even indicated that she had calculated, as she followed news of the nomination process, whether telling her story would be sufficiently likely to affect Kavanaugh’s confirmation—and therefore worth the personal cost of speaking out. You can hold these political calculations against her. But her candor about them speaks well for her candor in general.
        
          In several exchanges during her testimony, Ford signaled that she was shifting from one level of confidence to another. She said she wasn’t sure about the arrangement of her polygraph or the timing of her grandmother’s funeral, but in the next breath she expressed absolute certainty that she had written every word of the statement used in the polygraph. She stipulated that her recollection of the general location of the house party was just an estimate, but in response to the next question, she answered firmly that she had consumed no alcohol before the party.
        
          Given the opportunity to endorse other allegations or insinuations against Kavanaugh, or to say something bad about him beyond the boundaries of what she had reported, she refused. When she was asked whether she knew of him committing sexual assaults at other parties, she replied with a firm no. And she gave the same answer when she was asked whether he had ever engaged in improper sexual behavior with her on any of the other occasions when she had been near him.
        
          All of which makes it striking that on the central questions, Ford was definitive. She remembered Kavanaugh and Judge being quite drunk. She remembered them going downstairs after the attack, bouncing off the walls and laughing. She was clear about which things she could only infer—the conversation downstairs while she was upstairs, for example—and which things she had directly observed and would never forget. One of those things was the bed on the right side of the room. Another was her assailant’s identity. Sen. Richard Durbin asked Ford: “With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied: “100 percent.”*
        
          I can’t say with 100 percent certainty that Kavanaugh assaulted Ford. Nobody who wasn’t in the room can be that certain. But when Ford says she’s 100 percent certain about something, I take it very seriously. And that’s because she so rarely says it.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-expert-witness-on-psychology.html,"
          “Let’s go back to the incident,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy to Christine Blasey Ford on Thursday morning as she testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “What is the strongest memory you have, the strongest memory of the incident, something you cannot forget? Take whatever time you need.”
        
          “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,” Ford testified, “the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.”
        
          For me, and perhaps for other viewers, this exchange about the comedy of cruelty will be the very hardest to forget from Thursday’s hearings. As Slate’s Lili Loofbourow pointed out on Tuesday, several allegations of abuse against Brett Kavanaugh have called to mind that spectacle of men joining men and humiliating women, just to crack each other up.
        
          But that Leahy-Ford snippet sticks out for me in the way it taps into another running theme. At several points while answering questions on Thursday morning, Ford appeared to toggle between two modes of describing her experience. In one, she told her story as a victim of assault, her voice cracking as she wended through the ugly details. In the other mode, she became an expert witness—a clinical psychologist who had analyzed and meta-analyzed her own experiences, finding their locus in her brain. Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, Ford said to Leahy, as if she’d run herself through an fMRI machine and discovered that the central feature of her trauma—the laughter of these awful boys at her expense—was lighting up a patch of tissue in her medial temporal lobe.
        
          There were several other times when Ford stepped back from her raw account of the events of summer 1982, and offered up instead a processed version fit for academic publishing. She made remarks about “multifactorial aetoiologies” and the “sequelae of sexual assault,” and brought up the hippocampus another time as well. Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked how Ford was so certain—“100-percent,” even—that Kavanaugh had been the one to climb on top of her? “Just basic memory functions,” Ford replied, and then added the corroborating science: “and also just the level of norepinephrine and the epinephrine in the brain … that encodes memories in the hippocampus.”
        
          In another context—testimony from an actual expert witness, for example—this sort of neuro-talk might be used to bolster simple statements so they sounded more like scientific facts. But when Ford played that expert’s role on her own behalf, it served a different purpose. It was somewhat queer to watch such bloodless footnotes being added to a harrowing first-person account. If this proceeding has a point at all, it is perhaps to give Ford a chance to enact her own credibility—to tell her story to the Senate, face-to-face and under oath, in such a way that her experience cannot be dismissed. As an eyewitness, she did exactly that, with poise and dignity and power. And then, in responding to the questions after, she added on a second layer of discourse, full of scientific jargon, which seemed to distance her from both her trauma and her audience.
        
          Yet Ford’s appeals to science served as counterweights against the public narrative in which she’s been forced to play the victim. As a scholar, Ford has studied different ways that people respond to trauma and abuse: Some survivors exhibit what’s been called resilience and shake off the ill effects; others demonstrate post-traumatic growth and end up sturdier than when they began; and the rest—like Ford—remain afflicted with sequelae, suffering from depression, phobias, PTSD, or other lasting wounds. I suspect that mastering this science can’t make one’s suffering any less severe—but it might provide a patch of solid ground from which one might survey and understand a psychologically seismic event. Perhaps it was important for Ford to find that footing, and share that expertise, even as she shared the details of her attempted rape.
        
          Ford is, besides a clinical psychologist, a biostatistician and research methodologist. That means she studies how one might best assemble messy facts about a question and then draw believable conclusions. This topic couldn’t be more relevant to Thursday’s proceedings. Indeed, Ford’s 2016 book begins with a discussion of how researchers must strike a balance between the potential costs and benefits of any given line of inquiry, especially when those inquiries are carried out on human subjects. In this hearing, Ford made it very clear that this same idea has been on her mind in recent months: “I was calculating the risk-benefit for me of coming forward,” she told Feinstein, “and wondering whether I would just be jumping in front of a train that was heading to where it was heading anyway, and that I would just be personally annihilated.”
        
          Another telling reference to her work in science came when the GOP’s proxy questioner, Rachel Mitchell, asked Ford if something other than a sexual assault might have contributed to her anxiety and post-traumatic stress. “I think that’s a great question. I think the aetiology of anxiety and PTSD is multifactorial,” Ford answered, again lapsing into jargon. “We consider it a risk factor, so that could be attributable to the symptoms that I now have.” In a way, the most telling word in this response is we, as in we psychologists, and we, the experts on the topic of this hearing. Even as she testified for Congress, Ford was both a scientist and an eyewitness.
        
          As a scientist, Ford had weighed the risks and benefits of going public, and tried to find a balanced path. As a scientist, she’d evaluated both the process of the hearing—its methodology and scope—and the nature of the evidence that she herself might provide. The rest of us have tended to assume that what went on Thursday is all about appearances: How does Ford come off? What about Kavanaugh? Who’s asking the questions, and what tone is being taken? Yet Ford has indicated that she believes several other fields of research might be more germane than optics. She knows that she has volunteered to be a subject in this study, but that doesn’t mean that she won’t try to be an author of it, too.

          During Thursday’s hearing on Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Rachel Mitchell, special counsel for the Republicans, asked Ford multiple times about how she was able to afford the polygraph test, lawyers, and other resources needed to bring her account forward.
        
          At one point, Ford testified, “I’m aware that there’s been several GoFundMe sites … I haven’t had a chance to figure out how to manage those because I’ve never had one.” Her lawyers also claimed that they are working pro bono and paid for the polygraph. Ford has further had to move out of her house with her family for security reasons.
        
          There are currently more than a dozen campaigns on the GoFundMe site to raise money for the fees Ford has incurred throughout the process of coming forward with her allegations. The most successful campaign has raised more than $300,000 thus far from nearly 8,000 donors. The description promises, “We want to be very clear that the money raised from this campaign is going directly to the Ford Family. They are the only authorized beneficiary.”
        
          According to MarketWatch, the campaign’s funds jumped from $179,000 to $305,000 in the 30 minutes after Ford mentioned GoFundMe. Another campaign has raised about $200,000 from nearly 7,000 donors. The frequency of the donations picked up during Thursday’s hearing.
        
          Other campaigns appear to be focused on raising awareness around sexual assault more broadly, but they have not gained much traction.

          During the hearing on Thursday to review sexual assault allegations made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, accuser Christine Blasey Ford explained why she had waited to come forward with her account. Many critics have attempted to discredit Ford by painting the timing of her decision to make her allegation public as opportunistic and partisan.
        
          In a statement to investigators, which Rachel Mitchell, special counsel for the Republicans, referred to during the hearing, Ford claims that on July 6, she “had a sense of urgency to relay the information [of the assault] to the Senate and the president.” When asked if she had made any attempts to reach them on that date, Ford replied that she didn’t know how. At that point, Kavanaugh had not been named as the nominee, but he was on President Trump’s shortlist.
        
          After weighing her options, Ford says that she decided to pursue her “civic duty” and called the office of her congresswoman, California Rep. Anna Eshoo. Ford also said that she put in an anonymous tip to the Washington Post. Neither the paper nor the congresswoman got back to her before Kavanaugh’s nomination was made public.
        
          Three days later, on July 9, President Trump announced that he had selected Kavanaugh from his list of 25 “highly qualified” potential nominees. It was on that date that Eshoo’s office contacted Ford. The next day, Ford again tried to contact the Washington Post via an encrypted messaging service. The Post got her in touch with a reporter, Emma Brown, who would eventually be the first to publish Ford’s identity on Sept. 16.
        
          On July 18, Ford met with Eshoo’s staff and then with the congresswoman a couple days later, during which time she described the incident and her fears about confidentiality. Then, on July 30, Ford sent a letter to California Sen. Dianne Feinstein about her allegations and asked to remain anonymous. Feinstein and Ford spoke over the phone shortly thereafter.
        
          The Intercept reported on the existence of the letter on Sept. 12. At that point, Ford’s identity was still not known to the public, but she says that reporters began hounding her at her workplace. This led her to believe that her identity would eventually be leaked, and so she decided to come forward through a Washington Post story. Ford has subsequently received death threats, and she and her family were forced to move out of her house for their safety.
        
          It was this decision to come forward and publicly identify herself that eventually led to Thursday’s hearing.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/lindsey-graham-kavanaugh-christine-ford.html,"
          Republican reaction during and after Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday was largely mixed, with a number of GOP senators urging a wait-and-see approach until after Brett Kavanaugh appears before the panel on Thursday afternoon. One notable exception: Sen. Lindsey Graham, who reportedly is eyeing the judiciary gavel next year.
        
          Graham, like his fellow Republicans on the judiciary panel, ceded his time to Rachel Mitchell, a veteran sex crimes prosecutor the GOP had flown in to lead the questioning. But the South Carolina senator made up for lost time after Ford finished, unleashing a four-plus minute screed in front of reporters during which he suggested the hearing was a political charade orchestrated by Democrats to prevent Kavanaugh—or any other Donald Trump nominee—from making it to the high court. “All I can say is that we’re 40 something days away from the election, and their goal—not Miss Ford’s goal—is to lay this past the midterms so they can win the Senate and never allow Trump to fill the seat,” Graham said.
        
          “When it comes to where it happened, I still don’t know,” Graham continued. “I don’t know when it happened. She said she’s 100-percent certain it did happen. I bet you Judge Kavanaugh [says] ‘I’m 100-percent sure I didn’t do it.’ The people named say they don’t know what she’s talking about. She can’t tell us how she got home and got there. That’s the facts I’m left with—a nice lady who has come forward to tell a hard story that’s uncorroborated. And [if] this is enough, God help anybody else that gets nominated.”
        
          Graham repeatedly took issue with a variety of things he said Ford was unable to explain during her testimony—some of which she and her lawyers did indeed detail. “I don’t know who paid for her polygraph but somebody did,” Graham said, a few hours after her lawyers told the panel that they had paid for the polygraph. “She can’t tell me the house, she can’t tell me the city, she can’t tell me the month of the year,” Graham added, ignoring that Ford says the assault occurred in suburban Montgomery County and that she also suggested Thursday she’d be able to better pinpoint the timing of the incident if someone would just interview Mark Judge. (Ford says Judge was in the room when she was assaulted and that she remembers seeing him working at the Potomac Village Safeway in the days that followed. The dates of Judge’s employment, then, are crucial. Republicans refused Democrats’ calls to have Judge testify.)
        
          And what did Graham think of Ford more generally? “Very Competent, accomplished lady,” Graham declared. “Something happened. I don’t know what. But you’re asking me to say it was Brett Kavanaugh and I don’t know when it happened, where it happened, and he said it didn’t happen. But I will say this: I thought it was a good suggestion for her to talk to somebody to work through this.”
        
          That was not the only time Graham suggested on Thursday that a woman claiming she was sexually assaulted should talk to someone who is not in the U.S. Senate.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-kavanaugh-cspan-sexual-assault-stories.html,"
          During Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony about Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday, C-SPAN invited viewers to call in and comment on the proceedings so far. The invitation resulted in multiple women calling in, some to speak in support of Ford, others to question her motivations. One thing that many of them had in common, however, was a personal experience with sexual assault, which they shared in varying levels of detail. The calls amount to a different kind of testimony, an indication, if anyone still needed one, of just how common encounters like the one Ford has described really are, spanning generations, locations, and political ideology.
        
          Despite sharing similar experiences, the callers had different takeaways from Ford’s testimony. Sherri, a 65-year-old Republican from California, recounted how she was attacked by three men when she was 17 years old, men who “slugged me in the chest so hard I couldn’t breathe and I thought I was going to be raped.” Sherri says she felt “relief” after she was rescued by a passing motorist, and the three men were eventually prosecuted.
        
          But Sherri used her own story to question the validity of Ford’s. “They laid on her and groped at her, that’s horrible,” she said. “But she didn’t get raped, she didn’t get any of the further stuff done, but she talks like she was raped. … It’s a horrible thing to be attacked by anybody, but you get over it, especially if you feel so good that it didn’t go any further. You didn’t die and you weren’t raped.”
        
          Jessica, a 26-year-old Democrat from Chicago, was audibly emotional and declined to go into detail about her own assault, beyond that it occurred when she was 19 and in college. “It’s very important, I think, to victims of sexual assault that we take these accusations seriously,” she said. “And I’m disappointed that there hasn’t been an FBI investigation, because it’s 2018, the #MeToo movement has happened, and I think we need to come from a perspective of believing women when they come forward with these stories, because it’s not an easy thing to do, and I don’t think it’s something anyone would undertake lightly.”
        
          Another Democrat, Hillary, said that she was at a college party when someone spiked her drink and then followed her out of the building, at which point she successfully fought off her attacker. “I think the Republicans right now are heartless and spineless,” she said. “And I can’t imagine why they are putting a victim of assault or even just a supposed victim of assault up under prosecution. She’s not on trial. And I think they are treating her badly.”
        
          Republican Michelle noted that she went to high school “in an upper-middle-class area in the New England area” around the same time as Kavanaugh. In a particularly difficult story to listen to, she recalled an incident at a friend’s house during a sleepover when she was 12 years old.
        
          She went on to explain that her daughter was similarly molested by a dance instructor as a teenager. But while Michelle said that Ford’s testimony was credible, she questioned her motivations for publicly accusing Kavanaugh. “You don’t destroy people’s lives without evidence. I’m wondering what she chooses to accomplish. If I was going to do this, it would be if I saw he [had] records of hurting women on the bench on these kind of cases. Then I’d see the point of this. But if that’s not the case, why? Why would you do this if it’s not to prevent him harming women on the bench in this particular type of instance of sexual abuse?”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-lawyer-michael-bromwich.html,"
          During Thursday’s hearing, Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor employed by the committee, pressed Ford on the nature of her legal representation, possibly in an attempt to portray her as being guided by more powerful Democrats looking out for the interest of the party. As Ford attempted to address the key points of Mitchell’s questions, one of her lawyers jumped in. “Both of her counsel are doing this pro bono,”  Michael Bromwich told the committee. “We are not being paid. We have no expectation of being paid.”
        
          What Bromwich did not mention was that he not only was not being paid for his time representing Ford—he also left his job at a Washington law firm where he served as senior counsel.
        
          According to Bloomberg, Bromwich, 64, resigned from Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck, Untereiner & Sauber LLP, as some of the partners at the firm had objected to his decision to represent Ford.
        
          Bromwich, a Harvard Law graduate and former federal prosecutor, was known before this hearing for assisting the investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and, more recently, for representing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired in March by Jeff Sessions two days before his scheduled retirement and for whom Bromwich helped crowdfund legal fees. According to Bloomberg, President Obama picked Bromwich to reform the offshore drilling regulations after the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010.
        
          Bromwich joined Ford’s legal team late. The attorney sitting to her right at the hearing, Debra Katz, is known for her work representing sexual harassment and abuse victims.
        
          Ford’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee ended Thursday afternoon after Ford endured more than four hours of questioning about her allegation of being sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh in the 1980s and the subsequent trauma. During the hearing, Democrats complained about Mark Judge’s absence in the hearing, emphasized that the hearing should be seen as a job application rather than a trial, and praised Ford’s bravery. Mitchell pressed Ford for details related to Ford’s fear of flying, the logistics surrounding the party, her contacts with the press, and who paid for the polygraph test.
        
          Ford, for her part, tried to clarify her account and correct any small errors she might have made in any previous statements. She also emphasized that she had come forward in an attempt to be helpful and at a time before Kavanaugh’s nomination, when Trump could have chosen from other conservative judges.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/rachel-mitchell-christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          It seems fair to assume that Senate Republicans brought in Rachel Mitchell to undermine Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony against Brett Kavanaugh to ensure that the Supreme Court nominee gets confirmed. GOP senators asked Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor, to question both individuals on their behalf, largely because the optics of 11 men interrogating one woman are not ideal. But as Thursday’s hearing progressed, it quickly became clear that the optics of anyone trying to poke holes in Ford’s story are terrible. Mitchell’s questions devolved into a fishing expedition—an obvious attempt to find something, anything, to discredit Ford. It hasn’t worked. Mitchell sounds more like a politician than a prosecutor. And Ford comes across as consistent, competent, and credible.
        
          Initially, Mitchell approached Ford like a lawyer prepping her own witness to get her story straight before trial. She pointed out minor discrepancies in Ford’s account of the alleged sexual assault and asked her to clarify them. How many people, exactly, were at the party? How did she get home? What year, precisely, did the incident occur, and how can she be sure? These questions are fair game, and Mitchell delivered them professionally, using friendly language to prod Ford’s memory. (“Let me make sure we’re on the same page.” “Does that ring a bell?”)
        
          But things took a turn when Mitchell began to quiz Ford about her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The prosecutor asked whether “there are other things that have happened” to Ford, aside from the alleged assault, “that have also contributed” to her disorders. Ford, a psychology professor, gave a perfectly reasonable answer, explaining that there “are other risk factors” as well as “biological predispositions” for “certain disorders.” But the question itself was indefensible. Ford’s history of trauma is irrelevant to the credibility of her accusation; it might help determine how much Kavanaugh harmed her, but it cannot tell us if he harmed her. Mitchell was merely digging for reasons to discount her memory, to depict her as too damaged to recall the event with necessary clarity.
        
          It only got worse from there. Mitchell noted that Ford had resisted testifying in D.C. because she lives in California and has a fear of flying. How could that be, Mitchell wondered, given that she has previously flown to Delaware, Hawaii, and Polynesia? Ford had to explain that, with sufficient support from her loved ones, she can “get the gumption” to fly. Is it truly a surprise that, under the right circumstances, Ford can overcome her phobia? Or that she hesitated to take a cross-country flight to be cross-examined about her trauma? Mitchell’s questions marked a desperate attempt to impeach Ford’s veracity, one that only made Ford seem more candid and relatable.
        
          Mitchell also asked whether Ford talked to a lawyer about Senate investigators’ offer to interview her in California. That prompted her attorney, Michael Bromwich, to object, noting (correctly) that the prosecutor was wading into “privileged conversation between counsel and Dr. Ford.” Sensing the direction that Mitchell was heading, Ford told her that she “wasn’t clear on what the offer was” and that if she had been, she would have “been happy to speak with you out there.”
        
          The strangest colloquy between Mitchell and Ford, however, came when the prosecutor inquired about who had paid for Ford’s polygraph test as well as her lawyers. Really? Why not just go ahead and ask if George Soros is paying her off? Ford handled the matter well, admitting that she didn’t really know the answer, and Bromwich cut in to explain that her lawyers are working pro bono. Mitchell’s conspiratorial question was an embarrassment, a partisan ploy that almost seemed designed to please our conspiratorial president.
        
          Not all of Mitchell’s questions were objectionable—and to her credit, she maintained a courteous, respectful tone even when her inquiries bordered on the absurd. It seems possible that some of her more objectionable questions may have been fed to her by Republican senators. Regardless of whether that’s the case, halfway through Thursday’s hearing, it’s still a mystery why she agreed to take this thankless job. She doesn’t seem intent on character assassination, yet she also failed to extract any meaningful information from Ford. Before wrapping up her interrogation, Mitchell pointed out that a Senate hearing was a pretty terrible way to get to the bottom of a traumatic event. Ford agreed. Too bad Republicans’ artificially accelerated timeline mandated this spectacle.

SLATE,https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/why-teenage-girls-dont-report-sexual-assault.html,"
          While Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, long-standing debates about what is and isn’t a normal reaction to being sexually assaulted as a teenager continued to broil. Is it normal to simply leave the house and tell no one, as Ford says she did? Or to continue attending parties with boys you’ve heard have assaulted women, as Julie Swetnick, a more recent Kavanaugh accuser, has done?
        
          Heather Hlavka, a professor of criminology and sociology at Marquette University, has studied how teenage girls talk about sexual violence. She spoke with Slate about how kids think about sexual violence and why it comes to seem commonplace. The conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, is below.
        
          Haley Swenson: I know there’s a lot of diversity among teenagers, but broadly speaking, what do we know about how teenage girls think about and react to sexual violence and harassment? 
        
          Heather Hlavka: What we know is that young people really think about sexual violence in their lives similarly to the way adults do when they’ve been victimized. I’ve done work with boys and girls, but girls in particular are really talking about objectification [and] sexual harassment as part of the fabric of their lives. It seems to be commonplace that unwanted touching and grabbing were described as typical and routine interactions with boys at school, at parties, on playgrounds, on buses. Young people experience sexual violence at alarming rates and describe it as commonplace.
        
          How do they come to see it as normal?
        
          It’s not exactly that they see it as normal. The interviews I looked at are forensic interviews, with young people who reported it, so they wouldn’t have reported it if they didn’t know it was wrong.
        
          What I am saying is the language that they use to talk about it normalizes the experience for them. The culture is telling them that this is what they can expect if they’re women or girls. We keep trivializing these things as routine interactions, and then they trivialize it for themselves. Our culture says we won’t take them seriously, so they have to come to some reconciliation with that in order to fit back into their lives and feel like they haven’t been victimized.
        
          They’re getting messages from friends, family, media that say, “These are the ways we interact.” It’s reinforced by microinteractions between children, but it’s mostly language that they’re picking up from the culture around them.
        
          When we have news cycles that are addressing sexual violence and responding to it in certain ways, you can’t shield your kids from that. That’s how it gets reinforced. If no one’s taking us seriously, if we’re being told that’s not really that big of a deal because it wasn’t forceful sexual intercourse, they’re seeing it as routine because it’s happening to their friends and to them and everyone around them, so they develop this kind of normalization language.
        
          In my research, young women described chronic instances of unwanted touching, grabbing, harassment, and threats that they tried to ignore using language like “It just happens” and “They’re boys—that’s what they do” or “I never think it’s a big thing because they do it to everyone.” One young woman described harassment by a young man in her peer group as they rode the bus every day to and from school. He often threatened to “come over to her house and rape her” if she didn’t let him touch her body. She said, “I know he’s joking. It’s just hard to, like, why would he say that?” She was 14 years old.
        
          And an 11-year-old girl told an interviewer that she was forced to perform oral sex on a 17-year-old neighbor boy. She said, “He forced me … grabbed me tighter, and he said if I didn’t do it he was gonna rape me.” She continued, “If you don’t do what they want, they say they’ll rape you.”
        
          All of these experiences generally go unreported to anyone in a position of authority because “They do it to everyone—it just happens sometimes” or “We just deal with it.” Young women continually note that “no one will believe me” or “everyone believed him.” Friends and family members taught women to be the gatekeepers of men’s sexual aggression and violence, and if they “failed” to protect themselves, young women often blamed themselves and kept the secret because of the shame they felt and fear—and belief—that no one would believe them when they came forward to tell. In this very precarious position, young women who are experiencing sexual harassment and violence in their lives cognitively adapt to their experiences not by labeling themselves as victims but rather normalizing their experiences within a broader peer group and culture that says, “Boys will be boys”—they will be sexually and physically aggressive. It is normal and tolerated, and thus young women are told they must tolerate it as well.
        
          And girls also think it’s normal and natural that boys will behave that way? 
        
          Exactly. That’s what they’re being taught. It seems astonishing, and we think, “Oh, we can’t really be treating children that way,” but we do. What’s going on these last few days in the media [with Kavanaugh] are examples of what’s happening in our culture. And our kids are listening. So that’s when they’re picking up cues: “Yes, if I come forward with what happened to me, then I know they won’t believe me or will say it wasn’t a big deal and that I’m making a big deal out of nothing.” Or “His future is more important than mine.” Or telling boys that they will be forgiven for their behavior, and they can be expected to be bad and they’ll get away with it.
        
          If this is how you treat women and young girls, that’s a kind of normalizing discourse and language that they’re hearing that they now need to interpret in their lives.
        
          What do we know about rates of reporting this kind of violence among young people? 
        
          Young children report, but in ways that aren’t always totally clear to adults that that’s what they’re doing. They show us through their actions, their emotional changes, perhaps decreasing grades at school, desires not to be around certain people in their families, increased anxiety or depression symptoms, and sometimes even their physical bodies in the way children cling to parents, wet the beds, become despondent, have stomachaches or headaches or other unexplainable pain. Surely, and importantly, many children and young people experiencing violence may not show any of these sorts of symptoms, but as parents and caregivers, educators, and community workers, we should pay attention to all the many ways children tell us something isn’t right. It’s about asking, talking to children, paying attention to them, picking up on really important cues, and truly not expecting them to come forward directly and verbally to tell someone about harassment and abuse because they have been taught, for their whole lives, to not talk about sex, sexuality, or anything related to it.
        
          But among teenagers, reporting is very, very low. Because developmentally, you start to be aware of all these cultural things and barriers that stand in your way. But you know, no matter what your age, you always want to be included. You don’t want to feel isolated or like you don’t belong, whether it’s high school parties, fraternity parties, college campuses, or your workplace. And if you report people who are close to you, you could lose all of that, not to mention get someone close to you in trouble.
        
          In my research I do see young women who see young men or even older men around them who are perpetrating sexual violence against women in their same peer group. That just makes it even more routinized and habitualized, because you can’t speak out against that person without risking being denigrated and ostracized by your peer group. You could lose all of your friends and then have no support. There are so many barriers.
        
          We know that reporting is higher when the person who commits assault is a stranger. It’s far more common to go through sexual assault adjudication if it’s a stranger. It’s very complicated to be violently hurt so deeply by someone you trusted, and you’re far less likely to report.
        
          I can’t believe we’re still asking why people didn’t report. We have to stop asking that question. There are just so many barriers to reporting. And if you say, “Well, why didn’t you report?” then that’s just one more barrier to coming forward.
        
          Do you get the sense that #MeToo has trickled down to high school students? Is there any chance this kind of violence is becoming less normalized?
        
          I believe we are at a critical juncture right now, where we have a national and global conversation happening around rape culture and the routine, trivialized violence in women’s lives and those underserved and underrepresented, marginalized populations.
        
          But we need to be very careful about what we do with these discussions as adults, who clearly are not understanding or listening to our youth. I believe young people today are leading us into a new moment in which sexual violence will not be tolerated in the same ways and speaking out might not be as difficult as it has been in the past for so many. Adults and those in power have to take a back seat to young people, however, and let them lead the way. Social media and social movements have made it clear that experiences of violence and harassment are not rare but are instead routinized, and I believe the language of normalizing that violence will change along with these voices—despite, seemingly, the best efforts of many men in positions of power who repeatedly engage in violent, predatory behaviors, and purport that this is normal heterosexual courting. They are spinning a tale that fewer and fewer are committed to.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-opening-statement.html,"
          Christine Blasey Ford released the text of her opening statement on Wednesday, the day before her testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In it, she describes the night she says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her with the assistance of his close friend Mark Judge. She also tells of the lasting trauma she’s suffered in the decades since. The account is straightforward, detailed, and devastating to read.
        
          Watching Ford deliver the statement in front of the committee on Thursday morning was a different experience altogether. From the moment she began her testimony with a good-humored quip about needing caffeine, Ford was a picture of earnest resolve in the face of intimidation and fear. Her voice quivering but calm, she fought back tears as she delivered the allegations that have stalled Kavanaugh’s nomination.
        
          “I believed [Kavanaugh] was going to rape me,” Ford said of the assault. “I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.”
        
          Ford recalled that after she escaped the bedroom where her alleged assault occurred and locked herself in a bathroom, she heard Judge and Kavanaugh “leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs.” When they didn’t come back up, she said, she ran down the stairs and out of the house. That detail is chilling: In Ford’s telling, Kavanaugh and Judge didn’t even behave as if they thought what they did was wrong, or that it mattered, or that she might tell on them, or that they might incur consequences for their deeds.
        
          The lingering anguish Ford fought through to read her statement was instantly recognizable to anyone who’s been forced to relive and recount an experience of unspeakable terror, as so many women have done on the internet and among friends in the year since #MeToo began. The power of her statement and presence is a testament to the value of letting survivors of sexual violence tell their own stories. Over the past two weeks, Kavanaugh supporters have both implied and stated flat-out that they believe Ford is lying or misremembering the assault she says she survived in the summer of 1982. After witnessing Ford’s sincerity and deep-seated pain, it will be a lot harder for them to plausibly claim that she’s untrustworthy, rather than simply arguing, as many have already done, that what Kavanaugh allegedly did is no big deal.
        
          The character of Judge loomed large in Ford’s testimony, casting further shame on the GOP majority’s refusal to subpoena the man whose name appears alongside Kavanaugh’s in multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and assault, including Julie Swetnick’s claim that Kavanaugh and Judge were present during gang rapes. Ford’s statement makes Judge out to be nearly as culpable as Judge in her victimization. “Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack,” Ford said. “They seemed to be having a very good time. Mark seemed ambivalent, at times urging Brett on, and at times telling him to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.” Later in the hearing, Ford said the two boys’ “uproarious laughter … at my expense” was the most “indelible” memory she had of her assault.
        
          Ford’s decision to call Kavanaugh “Brett” instead of “Judge Kavanaugh” made them all sound like the people they were in the summer of 1982—high schoolers embedded in the toxic bro party culture of D.C.’s wealthy suburbs—instead of the people they are now, a professor who says the residual trauma from her assault prompted her to install a second front door on her home and a man a couple of key votes away from a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. The statement was a time capsule dug up from her past and painstakingly examined for the purposes of performing credibility for people who’ve already decided they’d rather side with Kavanaugh.
        
          After coming forward with her allegation, Ford said in her statement, “my greatest fears have been realized, and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. … Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life.” Listen to what she’s saying here: The public scrutiny and character smears her bravery has provoked have been nearly as difficult to endure as the actual sexual assault. And that’s all before she had to recite the most intimate details of a memory saturated with terror in front of a roomful of strangers who have treated her with open hostility, groused about her in public documents, and implied that her testimony has no bearing on Kavanaugh’s worthiness as a potential Supreme Court justice. Ford said in her statement that she felt it was her “civic duty” to report her assault at the hands of Kavanaugh, which she did, to her congressional representative, while he was still on Trump’s shortlist of possible nominees. It wasn’t just courage or a desire for justice that powered Ford’s shattering statement on Thursday. It was patriotism.

          Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had a question for Christine Blasey Ford: She had very vividly described the attack, but how sure could she have been that “it was Brett Kavanaugh that covered your mouth to prevent you from screaming. And then you escaped. How are you so sure that it was he?”
        
          Ford, a psychology professor who described speaking to reporters because she thought they were her students, gave a precise and scientific account of how memories are formed:
        
          While Ford may have been generous in assuming the judiciary panel knows how this works, Feinstein followed up: “So what you are telling us, this could not be a case of mistaken identity?”
        
          Ford responded, “Absolutely not.”
        
          When Sen. Patrick Leahy, another Senate Democrat, asked about the “strongest memory of the incident,” Ford said that, “indelible into the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two and having fun at my expense.”
        
          Feinstein’s colleague Sen. Dick Durbin asked again, “Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you.”
        
          Ford responded: “100 percent”

          When Christine Blasey Ford testifies publicly Thursday about her sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee won’t ask all their own questions. In what some see as a politically cynical move, the all-male cohort hired an outside female attorney to help interrogate Ford and Kavanaugh. Committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced on Tuesday that he had tapped Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor, for the role.
        
          Mitchell has been a prosecutor since 1993 and spent 12 years leading the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office’s sex crimes bureau. She eventually became chief of the office’s Special Victims Division, which handles both sex crimes and family violence, and the deputy county attorney. She is currently on leave from these positions.
        
          “She’s reasonable. She’s not the kind of person who’s going to attack someone,” said Robert Kavanagh, an Arizona attorney who has represented a handful of defendants in cases that Mitchell was prosecuting (and who is not related to the nominee). He said that he believes Mitchell will be “professional” in carrying out her duties on Thursday. “I can’t think of anything unethical or inappropriate that was done,” he told Slate about his experience opposing her.
        
          According to the Washington Post, Mitchell was best known until now for successfully prosecuting a Phoenix priest named Paul LeBrun in 2005 for sexually abusing boys between the ages of 11 and 13. She managed to convince the judge to allow two men from Indiana to testify against LeBrun even though the statute of limitations for their cases had passed. The priest was later sentenced to 111 years in prison.
        
          According to Grassley’s announcement, Mitchell has further won awards for her work from the Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys’ Advisory Council, the Arizona Children’s Justice Task Force, and former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano. Mitchell has used her position to advocate for stronger sexual assault laws and better accommodations to make abuse victims more comfortable when testifying in court. She is a registered Republican.
        
          For the most part, though, Mitchell has not been especially prominent. She rarely gives extensive comments to the press. In a 2011 interview with FrontLine magazine that multiple outlets have dug up, she discussed her views on the sexual abuse of children. When asked about the anxiety among children’s workers in churches that they may be falsely accused of molestation, Mitchell said, “False accusations are very rare. … The reality is that the authorities, if they are brought in to investigate, can weed out false accusations and the criminal justice system can do that.”
        
          Mitchell faced some criticism in 2003 for questioning the credibility of a quadriplegic woman who accused her husband of physically abusing her after initially denying the allegations. Mitchell further chose not to prosecute the case. She also weathered backlash in 2011 for making a plea deal with a Jehovah’s Witness elder who spent only six months in jail on charges of sexually abusing a teenage boy.
        
          Grassley’s recruitment of a female prosecutor for the questioning has also drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who argue that the senator sought out a woman for the role simply to avoid the damaging spectacle of having the 11 Republican men on the Judiciary Committee probe into Ford’s personal life. Through her lawyers, Ford herself had requested that the senators themselves ask the questions rather than relying on an outside counsel. Grassley has claimed that he wanted an outside counsel’s help “to establish the most fair and respectful treatment of the witnesses possible.”

          So far, very little good has come from Donald Trump’s decision to nominate a frat guy named “Brett” to the Supreme Court. It’s bad enough that Donald Trump—Donald Trump!—gets to reshape the court for a generation, but asking us all to take a depressing and demoralizing tour of the world of elite D.C. prep schools in the 1980s is a bridge too far. And given the right-wing’s desire to put Kavanaugh on the court—in part as a tour de force because he’s so unsuitable—it doesn’t sound like it’s going to get any less demoralizing or depressing any time soon. So we’re delighted to inform you that this cloud, too, has a silver lining, however modest: To show how bad the optics of male Republicans questioning Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford would have been, The Daily Show Photoshopped up an image of Mitch McConnell “pulling a Mrs. Doubtfire.” Check it out:
        
          Ah ha ha ha ha! Mitch McConnell doing a creaky falsetto in a fright wig! It almost … no, wait, it doesn’t make any of it okay. Thursday’s hearing is going to be a total nightmare, and should Kavanaugh make it to the Supreme Court, things will only get worse for everyone. You gotta laugh, though, right? You gotta laugh.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kevin-cramer-brett-kavanaugh-defense.html,"
          Even in a Republican Party that has shown disdain for Brett Kavanaugh’s accusers, U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer stands out for the degree to which he has lashed out at the women in his defense of Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.
        
          Cramer, who is running against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, first voiced heavy skepticism of Christine Blasey Ford’s story of attempted rape after she went public with it. Soon after, he called her claim “absurd” since the alleged assault “never went anywhere” and because both Ford and Kavanaugh “were drunk” at the time. (Reminder: “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford told the Washington Post. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.”) Then, remarkably, Cramer leaned in further—even though a second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, had come forward to accuse Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face at a drunken dorm party at Yale. (“I remember a penis being in front of my face,” Ramirez told the New Yorker. “I knew that’s not what I wanted, even in that state of mind.”)
        
          “Even if it’s all true, does it disqualify him?” Cramer told a local TV station in North Dakota on Monday, in reference to Ford’s specific allegation. “It certainly means that he did something really bad 36 years ago, but does it disqualify him from the Supreme Court? … It should never happen in our society but what if [there’s] 36 years of a record where there’s nothing like that again?”
        
          And what about Ramirez? In Cramer’s version of reality, her claim is “far more suspicious even than the first one,” since she “is not even really sure what she saw.” Cramer’s campaign did not respond to a request from Slate on Wednesday for comment on the allegations of a third woman, Julie Swetnick, who says she witnessed Kavanaugh engage in repeated nonconsensual sexual conduct when she knew him during his high school years. He did, however, flesh out his argument slightly in a brief interview with Politico, explaining that while the assault wouldn’t be disqualifying, lying about it would. “If it’s proven to be true, the issue isn’t so much about the [events of] 36 years ago, but what’s more concerning to me is that he’s been lying about it.”
        
          As illogical as Cramer’s comments are in the real world, they’re arguably just as illogical on the campaign trail. Kavanaugh’s confirmation, after all, was supposed to be a political weapon Cramer could use against Heitkamp in a state that went for Trump by 36 points two years ago. If Heitkamp votes against confirmation, she risks undercutting the bipartisan image she’s running on. But if she votes for confirmation, she’ll infuriate a significant slice of her liberal base. Heitkamp will have to confront that dilemma if and when the Senate votes on Kavanaugh’s nomination, but in the meantime Cramer’s remarks are giving her plenty of breathing room.
        
          Consider how much Heitkamp has simply tried to remain neutral during the mini-cascade of Kavanaugh scandals. “This is a very serious allegation which should be thoroughly investigated, and it’s up to the Senate Judiciary Committee to do just that,” she declared after Ford went public more than a week ago. On Wednesday, after Swetnick’s allegations were made public, Heitkamp’s campaign spokeswoman, Julia Krieger, held the line: “She’s going to hear out both sides on this issue. Congressman Cramer has been pretty clear he’s made a judgment already; Senator Heitkamp hasn’t made one yet.” That’s the same type of wait-and-see stance we’ve seen from a few of the moderate Republican senators, including Arizona’s Jeff Flake and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski.
        
          And while Heitkamp waits, her team is doing all it can to keep the spotlight squarely on her opponent. Wednesday’s campaign conference call featured several former members of North Dakota law enforcement criticizing Cramer for his comments. “When we have statements that diminish the seriousness of attempted sexual assault, my concern is it makes law enforcement’s job harder,” Tim Purdon, a former Obama-nominated U.S. Attorney in North Dakota, told reporters. “It makes victims less likely to come forward. … And it makes jurors more skeptical of these sorts of allegations.”
        
          Then, unprompted, Purdon added: “This isn’t about a nominee—that isn’t what I’m here to talk about.” Heitkamp could say the same.

          Ahead of her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday, Christine Blasey Ford’s prepared opening statement was released Wednesday night. “I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified,” Ford begins. “I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.” Ford, now a psychology professor in California, gives more context for the night in question and her relationship with Kavanaugh, as well as the ongoing personal struggles, she says, are the result of the sexual assault in 1982.
        
          Ford says while she was a student at Holton-Arms, an all-girls school in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, she and her classmates socialized with students from nearby schools, including the all-boys Georgetown Prep, where Kavanaugh was a student. “This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,” the testimony reads. Ford then goes on to explain in detail the night in question:

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-julie-swetnick-toxic-bro-culture.html,"
          In the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, a cohesive picture of young Kavanaugh has emerged. High school and college classmates have portrayed him as a frequently belligerent drunk, and in his own senior yearbook entry, he pegged himself as a heavy drinker and someone who jokes about sharing a woman sexually among friends.
        
          On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick came forward with disturbing new allegations that implicate both Kavanaugh and the bro culture in which he was apparently embedded. In a sworn declaration, Swetnick alleged that she “witnessed efforts by [Kavanaugh’s close friend] Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys.” Once, Swetnick said, she was the victim of a multiperpetrator sexual assault at one of the parties Judge and Kavanaugh attended, although she didn’t allege that they were among the perpetrators.
        
          Swetnick’s declaration reinforces a statement Judge’s ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Rasor made to the New Yorker in a piece published Sunday: According to Rasor, Judge once admitted to taking turns having sex with a drunk woman along with several other high school boys, though he said it was all consensual.
        
          Judge’s lawyer told the New Yorker that he “categorically denies” Rasor’s account. Many women who attended elite private D.C.-area high schools in the 1980s have, however, confirmed Kavanaugh’s accusers’ descriptions of the drunken, misogynistic atmosphere during that period. What started as a single story about a single incident at a single party—Ford at around age 15, having her clothes and body pawed at and her mouth smothered by a drunk Kavanaugh, with Judge egging him on—has turned into an indictment of the entire bro party culture in which they spent their youth.
        
          Alexandra Lescaze wrote in Slate this week that, as a high schooler at Washington’s National Cathedral School in the ’80s, she witnessed what students called “lineups”: a drunk girl in a room with several boys lined up outside, waiting to have sex with her. “Though there weren’t lineups of this nature at every party, they happened often enough that we had a term,” Lescaze wrote. “We traveled in groups and knew never to leave a friend alone at a party, but there was so much drinking that we sometimes lost track of each other. It could be difficult to know where your friends were and—if they were in a room with a boy—what was going on in there.”
        
          A late-’80s alumna of Holton-Arms, Ford’s high school, told Vanity Fair that a Georgetown Prep alumnus raped her on what was supposed to be a double date with a friend during her junior year. “He held his hand over my mouth and forced himself on me. I really tried to stop it, but women are so deeply conditioned to go along, and the traumatic response is to freeze,” she said. She told the friend what happened on their drive home. “I told her that he raped me, and she kept telling me that I was lucky, because he was so cute. … Why would I tell anyone after that reaction? What was anyone going to do?”
        
          This fleshing out of Kavanaugh’s teenage milieu makes the assault and abuse allegations against him more believable than if they’d come out in a vacuum. But the accounts that have emerged in the past few weeks have done more than just firm up these specific claims. They’ve spurred a broad public reckoning with the kinds of behaviors that flourish at alcohol-centered high school and college parties.
        
          Even as the #MeToo movement has spurred conversations about sexual assault and power dynamics, it’s been difficult to find a fresh approach to the discourse around teens, alcohol, and consent, which has been hashed to death and soured by bad journalism like the University of Virginia gang rape story in Rolling Stone. But the recent Kavanaugh allegations have proved capable of driving a blanket reassessment of bro party culture, especially among the now-adult women who experienced it. Their power stems from the organic, random way they bubbled up. This wasn’t a school system or wealthy community that made the news because of a high school gang rape. Kavanaugh may as well have been plucked from a hat filled with the names of every man who grew up rich, white, and athletic in America—and he just happened to have allegedly attended several parties in which high school girls were assaulted. The stories we’re hearing about D.C. prep schools in the 1980s lead one to wonder: What might we have found if we’d plucked any number of other names from that hat?
        
          The fact that this examination of party culture is happening in tandem with Supreme Court confirmation hearings could help observers comprehend what these stories are actually about: the intersection of white, upper-class male impunity and contempt for young women that infects communities across the country. The “lineups” that Lescaze and Swetnick have described are not gruesome aberrations specific to the tony suburbs of D.C. in the ’80s; they’re the predictable end product of a stew of entitlement, misogyny, one-upmanship masculinity, glamorized alcoholism, and a fetishization of virginity that shames women for having sex, thus discouraging them from identifying and reporting sexual assault. These sorts of assaults are at the far end of a continuum with the other abuses mentioned in Lescaze’s article and Swetnick’s affidavit—unwanted kisses, groping, trying to get girls drunker than they intended—and the sort of “Renate Alumni” boasting Kavanaugh and his friends encoded in their yearbook.
        
          For what feels like the first time, there is a glaring, urgent reason to discuss a toxic culture that is as familiar to young women today as it was to the students of Georgetown Prep, Holton-Arms, and the National Cathedral School 35 years ago. It’s prompting women all over the country, including hundreds of women from Ford’s school, to remember, relive, and possibly recategorize violations they endured as high school and college students. “We didn’t call it rape,” Lescaze wrote of the “lineups” she saw in the ’80s. With the entire country’s eyes on a man who allegedly partook in ritualized, normalized sexual abuse as a teenager, those “lineups” are finally getting seen for what they truly are. The indignities that preceded and surrounded them are overdue for a wholesale recall, too.

          On the eve of Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, NBC News reports an anonymous letter outlining another allegation of physical assault against Brett Kavanaugh was sent to Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado. The letter describes a more recent instance of troubling behavior from the Supreme Court nominee, when he was in his early thirties, alleging that Kavanaugh “physically assaulted a woman he socialized with in the Washington, D.C. area in 1998 while he was inebriated,” according to NBC News. “The sender of the complaint described an evening involving her own daughter, Kavanaugh and several friends in 1998.”
        
          The author of the letter does not appear to have been present at the time of the incident, but recounts what seems to have been relayed by her daughter, who was present.
        
          “The writer of the letter provided no names but said the alleged victim was still traumatized and had decide to remain anonymous herself,” according to NBC News. During a call with Republican Senate investigators Wednesday, Kavanaugh denied the latest accusation.

          As the Senate mulls the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, anti-abortion judges are wasting no time laying the groundwork for the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Earlier in September, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld two abortion restrictions that are patently unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent. On Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pulled the same trick, affirming the legality of an anti-choice Louisiana regulation that’s identical to a law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016.
        
          The statute at issue in June Medical Services v. Gee, Act 620, is a quintessential TRAP law designed to shutter abortion clinics through stringent regulation. Act 620 compels abortion providers to obtain active admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics. U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles permanently blocked the law in 2017, ruling that it imposes an “undue burden” on women’s access to abortion and therefore violates the U.S. Constitution. DeGravelles explained that, in 2016’s Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law that foisted the same admitting privileges rule upon clinics in the state. (It even used the same 30-mile measurement.) The court explained that the Texas statute ran afoul of the Constitution because the benefits it bestowed to women were outweighed by the burdens it imposed on them.
        
          In blocking Act 620, DeGravelles reasoned that, if a law is unconstitutional in Texas, it must also be illegal in Louisiana. That conclusion is quite sensible. After all, lower courts are bound by the judgment of the Supreme Court, which has held this type of TRAP law to be impermissible.
        
          But on Wednesday, in a 2–1 decision written by Judge Jerry Smith, the 5th Circuit disagreed. Smith did not attempt to argue that the admitting privileges rule benefited women in any meaningful way, since the Supreme Court ruled emphatically that it does not. Instead, Smith held that the burden it imposes on women is less severe than that of SB 2. While the Texas law would’ve shut down most of Texas’ abortion clinics, he noted, the Louisiana law will only shutter one, at most. And while it will disqualify some doctors from performing abortions, other doctors can pick up the slack.
        
          Doing some back-of-the-envelope math, Smith calculated that, under Act 620, abortion providers at one clinic would have to work about an extra hour a day to maintain their current pace. At worst, women at this clinic would have to wait roughly an extra hour for their procedures. This delay, Smith concluded, is “unlikely to result in an undue burden on women.” Therefore, Act 620 passes constitutional muster.
        
          This analysis is an extraordinary misreading of Whole Woman’s Health, if not an outright rejection of it. It is also just bizarre, for two obvious reasons. First, HB 2 would’ve brought the total number of Texas abortion clinics down from 40 to 8. In Louisiana, by contrast, there are only three abortion clinics in the entire state. Even if Act 620 doesn’t close an eye-popping number of clinics, it stands to close a third of them, creating a huge burden for women who relied on the shuttered clinic. Smith cannot plausibly allege that the analysis in Whole Woman’s Health hinged upon the fact that Texas tried to close 80 percent of its clinics instead of 33 percent.
        
          Second, Whole Woman’s Health instructed lower courts to weigh the benefits of an abortion regulation against the burdens. It did not decree that the burdens don’t matter if they compel patients to wait only an extra hour, or close only one of three clinics in the state. Since Act 620 creates no benefits for women while imposing real burdens, it must be unconstitutional under Whole Woman’s Health. (In a fiery dissent, Judge Patrick Higginbotham argued exactly that.)
        
          It’s obvious what Smith is really doing here. Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the decisive fifth vote in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt to invalidate the Texas law, and he has since retired from the court. He will soon be replaced by Kavanaugh—or, if his nomination falls through, a similarly conservative appointee. At that point, the new five-justice majority will begin chipping away at the constitutional right to abortion access. Anticipating that shift, the 5th Circuit has already begun disregarding precedent. And it has handed the Supreme Court a vehicle through which to further hobble Roe once a new Republican justice is installed on the bench.

          When asked Wednesday if his own history of being accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women affected how he views the three accusations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, Trump went on a lengthy, free-association discourse about the “false charges against me” foisted on him by the “false reporting” by the New York Times.
        
          “Well, it does impact my opinion, you know why? Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” Trump said at a press conference at the United Nations. “So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting at home watching television.”
        
          When asked about his past defenses of many men accused of sexual misconduct, including Bill O’Reilly, Roger Ailes, and Roy Moore, Trump dodged by saying, “I’ve known them for a long time, a lot of these people. And some I’ve been disappointed with—I have been disappointed with some. Others, there are charges that are pretty weak. But I’ve known people for a long time. I never saw them do anything wrong.”
        
          Trump also said that four of his accusers had been paid or had been offered money to make up false claims about his misconduct, an apparent reference to a 2017 report in the Hill newspaper that a prominent lawyer, Lisa Bloom, had tried to raise money to compensate women who wanted to come forward with accusations against Trump, two of whom eventually did. (More than a dozen women have come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump, one of whom, Summer Zervos, has sued him for defamation). To clear up Trump’s confused and confusing references to those women, New York Times reporter Michael Barbaro, who had interviewed Trump accusers in 2016, tweeted Wednesday evening that “none of the women who [Megan Twohey, his co-author] and I spoke with for this story (or any other) took money to make accusations against Trump, as he claimed today. There is zero evidence to support that claim.”*
        
          When CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang pointed out that Trump hadn’t really answered her question, he dismissed her, saying, “You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, please sit down, please.” (She asked it again anyway.)
        
          Trump was asked by another reporter what message he was sending to women by describing the accusations against Kavanaugh as a “con job”—the president responded, “I’ve used much worse language in my life than con job. It’s a con job by the Democrats and they know it.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-attorney-beth-wilkinson-cnn-supreme-court.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh’s attorney Beth Wilkinson appeared on CNN on Wednesday to respond to a new allegation that the Supreme Court nominee engaged in sexual abuse while in high school.
        
          Her defense of Kavanaugh seemed to hinge on the argument that his accusers have not called for authorities to investigate the alleged conduct, while at the same time insisting that no such investigation should take place. (Multiple accusers have called for an investigation, but Donald Trump’s Justice Department has declined to reopen Kavanaugh’s FBI background check before the Senate votes.)
        
          Here is footage of Wilkinson saying one thing, and then saying the complete opposite thing within seconds.
        
          Blitzer then pointed out that Swetnick, the woman at the center of the new allegation, had submitted a sworn declaration under penalty of perjury to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying she was at high school parties in the early 1980s where she saw Kavanaugh participate in sexual abuse. Wilkinson responded that the sworn statement to the Judiciary Committee wasn’t enough, and that Avenatti and Swetnick should have gone to police or the FBI.
        
          “Those are not law enforcement people,” Wilkinson said. “If you believe that these crimes were committed against your client, you should go immediately to law enforcement. Everyone is saying those are the people who have the right tools to investigate.”
        
          Again, Blitzer asked Wilkinson if she was calling for an investigation, which she had just seemed to demand. Again, she declined.
        
          And here’s what happened when Blitzer asked a third time.
        
          Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault, has repeatedly asked for such a probe, but her request was rejected. Multiple witnesses have since come forward with their own sworn declarations to the committee saying Blasey Ford previously told them of the alleged attack. Blasey Ford also released a polygraph test to the committee.
        
          In similar situations in the past, specifically after sexual harassment charges against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation process, the FBI has reopened its background check and interviewed relevant witnesses. The Senate Judiciary Committee, though, is ignoring precedent, likely because of a political calendar that involves the possibility that the GOP might lose control of the Senate in November’s midterm elections.
        
          Blasey Ford and Swetnick’s attorney have also requested that Mark Judge, who was a key figure in both women’s accounts, at least be called to testify. The committee has refused that request as well, possibly because Judge’s past writings about his own history with drugs and alcohol do not make him an ideal character witness.
        
          On Wednesday, when Wilkinson claimed that there were no other witnesses to Judge’s misconduct, Blitzer asked if the committee should call Judge, who has denied the allegations, to the stand. She rejected this request as well.
        
          So in summation, Kavanaugh’s legal defense and standard of evidence for confirmation for a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court are, respectively: His accusers should have asked for an investigation, and there shouldn’t be an investigation; his accusers don’t have any witnesses, also don’t call the primary witness. Got it.

          Apparently it’s Dumb Irony Day in the Senate because Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham—who has become one of Donald Trump’s top allies in Congress, as well as a frequent golf partner of POTUS’s—just issued a statement condemning the new allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on the basis that anyone who associates themselves with a suspected sexual abuser should not be trusted.
        
          Graham’s reasoning is that it’s implausible that Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick would have socialized on numerous occasions with Kavanaugh despite believing that he targeted inebriated women for sexual assault:
        
          Graham also took a passing shot at the credibility of Swetnick’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, calling him a “lawyer to porn stars.” (Avenatti also represents Stormy Daniels.)
        
          In addition to having been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women and being the reason Michael Avenatti is representing a pornographic actress in the first place, Lindsey Graham’s golf friend Donald Trump has appeared in three softcore porn movies.
        
          Maybe someone should show Lindsey Graham an affidavit about who Donald Trump is?

          “I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone—not in high school, not in college, not ever,” Brett Kavanaugh states in written testimony for Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          Kavanaugh has continued to unambiguously state his innocence of sexual assault and misconduct from Christina Blasey Ford, and described further accusations from Deborah Ramirez as “false and uncorroborated accusations” and “grotesque and obvious character assassination.” Kavanaugh also denied new accusations of sexual misconduct from Julie Swetinck: “This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone. I don’t know who this is and this never happened.”
        
          His Senate testimony appears to distance himself from his earlier descriptions of his high school days and acknowledge that “I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now.”
        
          In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Kavanaugh said in high school, “I was focused on academics and athletics, going to church every Sunday at Little Flower, working on my service projects, and friendship, friendship with my fellow classmates and friendship with girls from the local all-girls Catholic schools.”
        
          In that interview, he would only go so far to say about his drinking that “people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school—I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school.”
        
          Most importantly, however, he both “categorically and unequivocally” denied Ford’s allegations in his prepared testimony, and also said, “I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time,” which is largely consistent with what Kavanaugh’s associates and Republican senators have said in his defense.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/seth-meyers-brett-kavanaugh-virginity-defense.html,"
          Over the last few weeks, Republicans have made some pretty detestable statements in effort to exculpate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Condescending challenges to Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh have included questioning why Ford didn’t come forward earlier and calling her “mixed-up,” tactics reminiscent of the Anita Hill controversy.
        
          But as Seth Meyers pointed out Tuesday night, Kavanaugh himself offered up what might be the strangest defense yet. In his interview with Fox News on Monday Kavanaugh said, “I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.”
        
          “If you’re trying to distance yourself from sexual assault, maybe Fox News isn’t the place to hang out,” Meyers observed, “Usually when they interview someone accused of sexual assault it’s for a job.” Meyers didn’t miss a chance to make reference to the settlements Fox made with Bill O’ Reilly after numerous allegations of sexual harassment against the host, adding “Shout-out, Bill O’ Reilly.”
        
          Sexual intercourse, however, is not what Kavanaugh is being accused of. In fact, as Meyers pointed out, “those things have nothing to do with each other. It’s the same as saying ‘I couldn’t have robbed that bank. … I’m a virgin. Devoting yourself to celibacy doesn’t mean you can’t be a sexual assaulter. Just ask thousands of priests.’”
        
          Then again, maybe the platform Kavanaugh chose to defend himself condemned him to an ineffective denial from the start.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-summer-1982-calendars-parties-sports-beach-week-mark-judge.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh’s calendars from the summer of 1982, when Christine Blasey Ford has said her alleged assault most likely happened, show a few months filled with trips, sports camps, haircuts, parties, movies, “beach week,” and even being grounded for a few weekends.
        
          The calendars, submitted by Kavanaugh to the Senate Judiciary Committee, are meant to give an accounting of his whereabouts that summer and to narrow down what parties he did and did not attend that summer.
        
          But even if Kavanaugh could show that Ford was not present at each party he jotted down that summer, it’s not proof that they never encountered each other in the way Ford described. Ford told the Washington Post that she remembered “a small family room where she and a handful of others drank beer together that night. She said that each person had one beer but that Kavanaugh and Judge had started drinking earlier and were heavily intoxicated.” This suggests, in Ford’s telling, that Judge and Kavanaugh had been at a previous party or had been drinking together before arriving at the gathering.
        
          Ford also told the Post that “in those pre-cellphone days, teenagers learned about gatherings via word of mouth.” The Post also stated, “She also doesn’t recall who owned the house or how she got there,” meaning the gathering may not have been necessarily prescheduled or even had been a “party” per se.
        
          While Ford said the assault was most likely that year, she was not entirely sure.
        
          The calendars have some days where Kavanaugh did not note any particular activity and also show days when Kavanaugh socialized with Mark Judge, who Ford said was present during Kavanaugh’s alleged assault. On July 1, Kavanaugh wrote, “Tobin’s house—Workout, Go to Timmy’s for Skis w/Judge, Tom, Bernie, PJ, Squi.” About three weeks later, Kavanaugh would interview for his application to Yale.

          Christine Blasey Ford has provided four sworn statements from people who say they had discussed her alleged assault before Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.
        
          The declarations are from three of her friends as well as her husband, Russell Ford. Russell says that Christine had told him that her assailant was Kavanaugh before his nomination but did not mention him specifically again until his name came up as a potential Supreme Court nominee for the seat that would eventually go to Neil Gorsuch. “I remember Christine saying she was afraid the President might nominate Kavanaugh,” Russell Ford wrote.
        
          In a meeting with Christine Blasey Ford in 2013, her friend Adela Gildo-Mazzo says that Ford told her “she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was younger.” Gildo-Mazzo says Ford told her “she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge.”
        
          Rebecca White, a friend and neighbor of Ford, said in her statement that after she had written a post on social media last year about “my own experience of sexual assault,” Ford told her “that when she was a young teen, she had been sexually assaulted by an older teen.”
        
          “I remember her saying her assailant was now a federal judge,” White wrote in her statement.
        
          In the statement from her friend Keith Koegler, he says that he had discussed the alleged assault with Ford after the infamously short sentence of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner for sexual assault in 2016: “Christine expressed anger at Mr. Turner’s lenient sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C.”
        
          Koegler said that Ford later mentioned Kavanaugh specifically after Anthony Kennedy resigned from the Supreme Court: She wrote him an email “in which she stated that the person who assaulted her in high school was the President’s ‘favorite for SCOTUS.’ ” Koegler responded that he had remembered the conversation they had in 2016 and asked for the name of the man she was referring to.
        
          Ford responded: “Brett Kavanaugh.”

McConnell, by way of defending the gender shutout, succinctly summed up the GOP zeitgeist on Capitol Hill, which is, in a word, clueless.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-ramirez-ford-which-women-matter.html,"
          For all the pain and trauma brought up by this week’s turn in the roiling national debate around the sexual assault allegations against SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the story about his 1983 high school yearbook entry is almost the most painful. According to an account Monday in the New York Times, Kavanaugh’s page noted that he was a “Renate Alumnius.” As the Times revealed:
        
          Renate Schroeder Dolphin, the woman who was the target of this sexual boasting, had earlier this year signed a letter supporting Kavanaugh. In a statement written after she learned of the yearbook code, she said, “I can’t begin to comprehend what goes through the minds of 17-year-old boys who write such things, but the insinuation is horrible, hurtful and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated this way.”
        
          A spokeswoman for Kavanaugh advised the Times that the inside joke was simply a reference to a single high school event that the two attended together, during which they “shared a brief kiss good night.” Dolphin said she never kissed him.
        
          Compared to the raft of recent stories about alleged violent sexual attacks, the yearbook story is hardly Earth-shattering. It slots nicely into the “boys will be boys” narrative Kavanaugh supporters are playing out to claim that “roughhousing” and youthful experimentation shouldn’t be classed as sexual assault, even as it widens the gap between the choirboy image Kavanaugh is attempting to paint and the mounting evidence that in his youth he often seemed to behave like every guy in a convertible in every John Hughes movie ever.
        
          But in addition to standing as yet more evidence that drinking was a big part of the young Kavanaugh’s story, what is also unmistakable in the “Renate” story is the absolute, seemingly mindless cruelty toward women who didn’t know they were the targets of such abuse. Even if you accept the anodyne version of the story—that these boys were all simply proud to have dated Renate (even though they did not, in fact, date Renate)—and the anodyne platitude, again delivered through a spokeswoman, that “[Kavanaugh] admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day,” the throughline here is becoming too familiar to miss. Indeed, it is the same one that emerged in the Kavanaugh hearings: The women who matter to Kavanaugh and Senate Republicans in this process are the high-status women—the lawyers and the girls’ basketball team and Amy Chua’s daughter. Their experience of Kavanaugh is all that should be credited. Other stories about Kavanaugh can be ignored.
        
          Indeed, Kavanaugh said this very thing Monday night in his Fox interview when he insisted that we should all “listen to the people who’ve known me best my whole life,” while dismissing as “smears” and “coordinated” attacks the myriad claims—including numerous claims by Mark Judge, who is also named in the alleged high school assault—that Kavanaugh could be recklessly cruel, especially when drinking, to girls he didn’t know and doesn’t recall.
        
          This is the same dynamic that so frustrates women seeking to contend with Kavanaugh’s judicial record. It is certainly compelling and important that he was a mentor to female students and law clerks. But that is half the story. In addition to that, he has had, and will in the future have, exponentially greater impacts on the women he does not know. And if we have learned anything from this process, it is that he has shown himself time and again to be someone who doesn’t have a good deal of empathy or solicitude for the women not in his immediate orbit. During the hearings, the striking manifestation of this was his cavalier attitude toward Jane Doe, a migrant in government custody seeking an abortion for which she had already been granted legal permission. The same dynamic has now played out in real life as Kavanaugh has found himself charged with the fact that there was a good deal of drinking and a good deal of overt shaming of women that happened among his high school friends and the fraternity and secret society to which he belonged at Yale. Time and again, the message seems to be that Kavanaugh was a perfectly nice person who could also treat women, and especially women he didn’t know, as immaterial. Unfortunately, part of being a champion of women is understanding that you can still degrade or diminish or deny the dignity of women you don’t happen to know personally—that their dignitary interests are as important as those of your female clerks and high school pals.
        
          One of the aspects of the new Debbie Ramirez allegations that emerged earlier this week is the statement made by James Roche, his freshman-year roommate at Yale. While Roche didn’t recall the incident Ramirez described, he said:
        
          I was also struck by Roche’s claim that “Debbie was very worried about fitting in. She felt that everyone at Yale was very rich, very smart and very sophisticated and that as a Puerto Rican woman from a less privileged background she was an outsider.” Essentially, the between-the-lines message here seems to be that Ramirez was not a woman Brett Kavanaugh would have felt he had to champion. But that fact alone doesn’t make her account untrue.
        
          I am going to state yet again that I didn’t know Kavanaugh at Yale and have no firsthand knowledge of his conduct there. I am going to echo the very smart and subtle point made by Matt Bai on Thursday, which is that regardless of what Kavanaugh has actually done, this could have been an opportunity for a genuine champion of women to say as follows: “Judge me for my lifetime of service, not for whatever may have happened at 17 that I was too stupid and drunk to remember.” But by insisting—in the face of copious evidence to the contrary—that behind him lies an entire lifetime of church service and chivalric treatment of women, Kavanaugh is erasing these other women as irrelevant from his story. More, he is painting himself as their victim, which will be fully realized when a sex-crimes prosecutor questions Ford on Thursday. He does not even allow, not for an instant, for the possibility that he hurt people he doesn’t remember in ways he cannot recall, and that this wouldn’t make them liars or part of a coordinated smear campaign. As Bai puts it, “My fear is that his experiences as a partying teenager didn’t actually teach him a hell of a lot about fallibility or shame. He seems not to have emerged with much appreciation for the gray areas in which most larger truths reside.”
        
          It’s a fine line between claiming to believe victims and wanting to hear the facts they allege, and needing to protect one’s own reputational interests. Heaven knows, Judge Kavanaugh is in a nearly impossible place between evincing respect for these women, who have come forth reluctantly and with contemporaneous proof, and calling them outright operatives and liars, which appears to be what the GOP strategy has now become. But wherever the line may be, between fact and fabrication, between truth and lie, and between vino and veritas, it can apparently be drawn for Brett Kavanaugh between the women I know best and the women who just don’t count. That’s why the yearbook story matters. That’s why 17-year-old Jane Doe matters.
        
          The “women know I am virtuous” standard is a fault line that can work—with only dubious moral efficacy—for private citizens. But it works not at all when those in power have the ability to impact the lives of millions of women, who don’t know him at all. These invisible women who claim Kavanaugh has harmed them should be heard out and treated with at least a modicum of respect, precisely because they have now become a place holder for the invisible women whose lives he will shape for years to come. That some women are said to count more than others is not a defense to the current charges. It is the definition of the problem.

          A new fear swept through the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon as Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination sat in a holding pattern ahead of Thursday’s hearing: The fear of weekend work.
        
          Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, according to several senators, told Republicans at a Tuesday luncheon to prepare to work through the weekend to process Kavanaugh’s confirmation. They want to wrap it up as soon as possible for several reasons: Because they’re already irritated that it’s taken this long, they want Kavanaugh on the bench as close as possible to the start of the new SCOTUS term on Monday, and they don’t want any new allegations to surface or wrong turns to be taken while the nomination hangs in the wind.
        
          Here’s how the process will work.
        
          The hearing with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford will be held Thursday at 10 a.m., and the committee could vote on the nomination at any point afterwards. As much as Republicans leaders might prefer, say, a Thursday afternoon vote to happen, the presence of undecided Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake on the committee—where the Republicans outnumber Democrats by one vote—might necessitate some time to digest the hearing before the vote could be taken. Common sense and the optics of “rushing” would also necessitate some time to digest the hearing.
        
          Let’s consider a scenario, then, where the committee approves Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday. The soonest that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could introduce the nomination in the full chamber, by filing a cloture petition, is on Saturday, and the Senate could vote to end a filibuster two days later, on Monday. After that—and barring any time agreement with the Democrats, which we shouldn’t expect Republicans to offer—the Senate would have to burn through 30 hours of debate time. So the final vote on confirmation would be on Tuesday or Wednesday.
        
          Nothing has been set in stone yet, because no one knows how Thursday’s hearing will turn out. If it goes really badly for Kavanaugh, then there might not be any advancement necessary. If Kavanaugh puts all doubts to rest and proves himself to have been the bright young pip who was too busy with church activities to ever lay eyes on an alcoholic beverage, he could be confirmed with 53 to 55 votes early next week.
        
          Some of the more gung-ho members of the Judiciary Committee will be ready to start immediately.
        
          “It’s going to be pretty hard to move this along without votes on Friday and Saturday probably,” Utah Sen. Orrin Hath told reporters Tuesday. Or Thursday and Sunday. Or Friday and Monday! The latter sounds much better, and one suspects that candidates for reelection on both sides would agree. (Also better: No votes, ever again, on anything.)
        
          I asked Maine Sen. Susan Collins if a process that began right after the hearing on Thursday, or on the following day would be too fast for her liking.
        
          “I truly can’t answer that question,” she said, “because I don’t know what’s going to happen at the hearing.”

          President Trump told reporters Tuesday that the latest accusation against Brett Kavanaugh—that at a party during college, he exposed his penis to a classmate—was part of a “con game” and that Deborah Ramirez, the woman accusing Kavanaugh, “has nothing,” and added that she ”was totally … messed up.”
        
          This is the president’s most direct and aggressive criticism of both the process and of Kavanaugh’s accusers, but it’s of a piece with his comments Friday, when he said that if what happened to Ford had been as serious as she said, “Charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.”
        
          Before that, Trump both was more open to delaying a confirmation vote and didn’t go after Kavanaugh’s accuser. “If it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay,” he said last week, “They’ll go through a process and hear everybody out. I think it’s important.” He doesn’t seem to think it’s important anymore.
        
          Trump’s more combative tone is consistent with the tack taken by senior Senate Republicans in the wake of Ramirez’s accusations and an attempted intervention by lawyer Michael Avenatti. Orrin Hatch called Ramirez’s accusations “phony” and that “it’s not untypical for our friends on the other side to pull that kind of crap.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the latest accusations were part of “a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man” and promised to hold a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-drinking-age-choirboy-claims-dubious.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh made the following assertion about his high school social life during a Monday night Fox News interview:
        
          The context here is a little complicated. The above was part of Kavanaugh’s response to a question Fox’s Martha MacCallum asked him about a claim by Democratic attorney-slash-famehound Michael Avenatti that when Kavanaugh was in high school, at Georgetown Prep in suburban D.C., he engaged in the premeditated “targeting” of women with alcohol in order to take advantage of them sexually. That particular charge is vague and uncorroborated; Avenatti, who did not go to high school in the same area or at the same time as Kavanaugh, has not said what basis he has for making it.
        
          At the same time, though, the most detailed accusation of misconduct against Kavanaugh—Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that he forced her into a bedroom and sexually assaulted her at a party in the summer of 1982—includes the allegation that he was “stumbling drunk” when he did so. (He would have been 17 at the time; he began his senior year that fall.) A Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s, Deborah Ramirez, says he crudely exposed his penis to her while drunk at a party during their freshman year. Kavanaugh’s roommate at the time of the alleged Ramirez incident says Kavanaugh was “frequently, incoherently drunk” when they knew each other and that he became “aggressive and belligerent” when intoxicated.
        
          So, Avenatti aside, there are real reasons to wonder if Kavanaugh had a problematic relationship with alcohol when he was a teenager. In that light, his brush-off about drinking being legal for seniors is worth examining. For one, it appears that drinking was not legal for high school seniors when Kavanaugh was one: Maryland law was amended in July 1982 to make the drinking age 21 for anyone who hadn’t turned 18 by the time the law passed. Kavanaugh didn’t turn 18 until February 1983, and it seems unlikely that most of his classmates were 18 well before their senior years either.
        
          This drinking wasn’t a big deal for us approach is also of a piece with Kavanaugh’s broader claim of having been much more interested in church, as a young man, than he was in partying:
        
          Another one of his answers:
        
          This from an individual who chuckled in a 2015 speech that his alma mater’s unofficial motto was “What happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep”—and whose senior yearbook entry listed him as the “Treasurer” of the “Keg City Club” and the “Biggest Contributor” to the “Beach Week Ralph Club.” Come on, man! We all also went to high school.

          “Back in the day,” Trevor Noah began Monday night’s Daily Show segment on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, “the nomination process was as exciting as a Ben Carson audiobook.” Then he recounted how far we’ve come in the past few months: First, it was withheld records from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House under President George W. Bush, which weren’t released until hours before the hearing. Then, of course, it was the allegations of sexual misconduct made by women from his high school and college days. As Noah puts it, “there’s so much drama in these hearings that even the Real Housewives of Atlanta are watching it like, ‘Goddamn, this is insane.’ ”
        
          On the second allegation, reported Sunday in the New Yorker, that Kavanaugh drunkenly exposed himself to Deborah Ramirez at Yale, Noah had this to say: “I don’t understand why guys are still whipping out dicks.” Neither do we, Trevor. Neither do we.
        
          Noah went on to note that Kavanaugh is pushing back with, ahem, compelling evidence: His calendar from 1982, which proves that he wasn’t even at that party since … it’s not written down? “If the man has a calendar, then the case is closed,” Noah joked, “because everyone knows that if it’s not on your calendar then you never did shit.”

          Time’s Up, the well-heeled movement founded to combat sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond, is now calling on Brett Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination to the Supreme Court for “the good of the court and the good of the country.”
        
          “Given the multiple serious allegations against him, Kavanaugh can no longer credibly serve on the nation’s highest court,” read a statement issued by the organization on Monday night. “His confirmation would compromise the integrity of the court for generations to come.” The statement is notable in that it makes not only an ethical plea against Kavanaugh’s confirmation but also a practical one, warning that if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court, “the legitimacy of everything Judge Kavanaugh touches will be questioned.”
        
          Though Time’s Up directly calls on Kavanaugh to be the one to withdraw, that appeal seems, at best, a rhetorical conceit and, at worst, a waste of energy. The judge shows no signs of stepping aside: As recently as Monday night, he refuted allegations that he sexually assaulted two women, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, in an interview with Fox News, insisting that he deserves a “fair process.”

          Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was heckled out of a restaurant Monday night in Washington by protesters opposed to Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination.
        
          In a video later posted to social media, a woman can be seen approaching Cruz and his wife, Heidi, in Fiola, an Italian restaurant near the Capitol, as fellow protesters chanted, “We believe survivors.” The woman began by telling Cruz she would like to talk to him about Kavanaugh, saying that she was a constituent and that she had a right to know his stance on his nomination.
        
          “I know that you’re very close friends with Mr. Kavanaugh,” she said. “Do you believe survivors, sir?”
        
          “God bless you, ma’am,” Cruz said as he took off his coat and sat down.
        
          “Bless you as well,” she replied. “I really appreciate you. I’m a survivor of sexual assault. I believe all survivors. There are now three people who have come forward and who have said that Brett Kavanaugh has attacked them. I know you’re close friends with him. Could you talk to him about that?”
        
          At this point, the chanting grows louder in the restaurant, and Cruz put his coat back on and motioned to his wife to leave.
        
          In the next video, the crowd continued to grow louder, and one man shouted, “Beto is way hotter than you, dude.” The crowd of protesters cheered when Cruz and his wife left the building.
        
          Earlier on Monday, a crowd of survivors of sexual assault gathered at Cruz’s office in Austin, Texas, to protest Kavanaugh’s nomination and express their support for his accusers.
        
          Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school and college, respectively. Kavanaugh and the White House have denied the allegations, and both Kavanaugh and Ford are set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, ahead of his confirmation vote.
        
          Cruz announced his support for Kavanaugh in July, calling the nominee “one of the most respected federal judges in the country.”

          Facing mounting accusations of sexual misconduct, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, sat down for an interview with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum that aired Monday night. Despite the friendly confines of the network, MacCallum put in a good-faith journalistic effort in her questioning. The host didn’t get much in response other than flat denials, and failed to make any significant headway in getting Kavanaugh off script, but seemed content to keep moving rather than try to pry new information out of the beleaguered nominee.
        
          As a result, Kavanaugh’s answers predictably denied the sexual assault allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford about an incident from when they were both in high school 30-plus years ago as well as another accusation published by the New Yorker from former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, who says the Supreme Court nominee “thrust his penis in her face” at a party while in college. Kavanaugh, who appeared emotional at times during the interview, kept to a very tightly worded script, repeating a variation of several talking points in response to a variety of different questions:
        
          In general, Kavanaugh’s answers were more lawyerly than emotive. Coming off as circumspect and evasive is usually not the goal of sit-down-spouse-by-your-side interviews, but it was likely enough to reassure Trump Republicans already sympathetic to the cause. After denying the assault allegations, when asked if he knew Ford, Kavanaugh said, “I may have met her.” “I was never at any such party,” Kavanaugh said of the night in question in 1982 when Ford says Kavanaugh, then a high school student, forced himself on her. “I am not questioning … that perhaps Dr. Ford … was sexually assaulted by someone in some place,” Kavanaugh continued. “What I know is I never sexually assaulted anyone in high school or at any time.”
        
          The most potentially perilous portion of the interview for Kavanaugh going forward will likely be his broad pushback against the growing portrayal of the nominee as a hard-drinking, hard-partying high school and college student. It’s a claim that is falsifiable and could undermine his credibility, if found to be false.
        
          “I’m a good person. I’ve led a good life. … I’m not perfect,” Kavanaugh said. “I just want a fair process.”

          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was incensed in his opening remarks Monday afternoon, by which I mean he used a few sharp words and even inflected his voice a couple of times. McConnell described Democrats’ “choreographed smear campaign” against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as “despicable” and a “new low” designed to “destroy a man’s personal and professional life.” Lest anyone think that Republicans might consider pulling Kavanaugh should further allegations surface, McConnell offered resolve.
        
          “I want to make it perfectly clear,” he said. “Judge Kavanaugh will be voted on, here on the Senate floor. Up or down, on the Senate floor, this fine nominee to the Supreme Court will receive a vote, in the Senate, in the near future.”
        
          A day after allegations of sexual misconduct from a second accuser, Kavanaugh’s former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez, surfaced in the New Yorker, Republicans put on a show of confidence in the nominee as the president reportedly grew impatient with the languid pace of Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The nominee, too, put on a show of confidence in himself, appearing with his wife in a Fox News interview and sending a defiant, defensive letter to the Judiciary Committee. While Republican senators did a passable job masking their impatience, at least initially, with Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations last week, they made little such effort on Monday.
        
          Just about every Republican I heard from today observed that the New York Times—even the liberal New York Times, etc.—had passed on the Ramirez story. (Reasons for why the Times didn’t publish it are in dispute.) Judiciary Committee Republicans have reached out to Ramirez’s lawyers for more information but claim they haven’t made much progress.
        
          “We are told that if we want to know the allegations, ‘read the New Yorker,’ ” Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, a committee member, told reporters Monday. (He clarified that this was a paraphrase.) “And that’s all they’re willing to say.”
        
          Even if they do hear from Ramirez, and Ramirez says she’s willing to testify, there is zero indication that Republicans would delay their schedule once again to accommodate her. They say they take all allegations like this seriously, and wouldn’t want to say anything untoward, but the overriding feeling is: It’s time to wrap things up.
        
          “You’re always concerned when somebody makes an allegation against someone with the type of impeccable record that this particular individual has,” South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds told me of the Ramirez story. So should the schedule, where a committee vote could come as soon as Ford walks out of the hearing room on Thursday, be pushed back?
        
          “I think we’re going to move forward with the schedule, and we’ll just let the chips fall,” Rounds said.
        
          Sen. Ted Cruz, who’s not exactly freewheeling with the media these days, said that “committee staff was, as I understand it, looking at the allegations, and we need to look at actual facts.” Should Ramirez testify at the Thursday hearing, though? “As I said, the committee is looking at the allegations.”
        
          Retiring Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, ornery and with one foot out the door, came through by saying what his colleagues wouldn’t, calling the allegations “phony.” When asked why he thought that, he elaborated: “Because I know it is. That’s why.”
        
          But what about the people who actually matter? Brett Kavanaugh could go on a cannibalistic massacre down Pennsylvania Avenue and still have 47 votes. This comes down to four senators: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, and Bob Corker. If two of them join all Democrats in opposing Kavanaugh, the nomination would be defeated.
        
          Neither Collins, Flake, nor Corker appeared to enter the Capitol through the Senate subway system as they usually do. And when Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski arrived, so many reporters got on the escalator to chase her that it broke.
        
          Asked whether she wanted to see Ramirez testify, Murkowski said, “That’s up to [her].” Murkowski’s vote, though, still seems to hinge on Ford’s testimony.
        
          “We’ve got a hearing on Thursday, and I’m going to be listening to the hearing,” she told reporters. Susan Collins, who still sounds generally impressed with Kavanaugh, told CNN that she would make a decision after Thursday’s hearing too.
        
          It’s difficult to tell whether the show of confidence on Monday afternoon, in which the New Yorker allegations seemed to make very little difference to Kavanaugh’s prospects, is real or not. It could just be a façade Republicans are putting up while they await polling data on how Kavanaugh’s confirmation would affect the midterms. It could be a desperate last effort to save a nomination that’s sinking. Or it could be as clear as what Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a leader of the GOP membership, told me when I asked if they were still 100 percent committed to confirming Kavanaugh.
        
          “Seems like it to me,” he said.

          About half of Yale Law School’s students attended protests against Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court on Monday.
        
          Dozens of professors canceled or rescheduled classes as more than 100 students went to D.C. to voice their opposition to Kavanaugh and join with other progressive groups at the capitol. The demonstrating students met with senators and stood outside the Supreme Court holding signs protesting the nomination proceedings and demanding an investigation into the sexual assault allegations made against the judge.
        
          About 200 students also stayed on campus to hold a sit-in at the law school, reportedly filling the main hallway of the building. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Yale Law School alumnus, reportedly spoke to the students and echoed their demands for a full investigation. The protestors have reportedly been wearing black.
        
          Yale University has come up repeatedly during this Supreme Court fight. Kavanaugh attended both Yale College and Yale Law School in the 1980s. In recent weeks he has been accused by two women of sexual misconduct. One of his accusers, Deborah Ramirez, was his classmate at Yale College and alleged that he thrust his exposed genitals in her face at a dorm party when the two were freshmen. (He has denied the accusation.) Former law school students also told the Guardian and the Huffington Post last week that Yale professor Amy Chua advised female students seeking clerkships with Kavanaugh to have a “certain look” during interviews. Chua has denied these accounts.
        
          An ad hoc group of students called Yale Law Students Demanding Better have been planning the demonstrations since Thursday night. They aimed to show their support for Ramirez and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of pinning her down and attempting to remove her clothes during a party in high school. Both Ford and Kavanaugh, who has denied her allegation, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
        
          The Yale students protesting Monday also intended to push for an investigation into the allegations by a neutral third party, express solidarity with victims of sexual violence and harassment, and bring attention to Kavanaugh’s potential impact as a Supreme Court justice on issues like reproductive rights. The students are also calling on the Senate to avoid treating Kavanaugh’s accusers the same way it did Anita Hill, a Yale Law School alumnus, during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings in 1991.
        
          Samantha Peltz, a student and organizer for the group, told Slate, “[Yale Law Students Demanding Better] is really people who have come together from across the Yale Law School community to organize, to plan this protest … and to follow up with next steps for accountability and transparency at Yale.”
        
          The law school will have a town hall on Tuesday for students to ask faculty about internal issues that this nomination process has brought to light. A majority of faculty members signed an open letter last week calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct a fair confirmation process and marshal a neutral fact-finder to investigate the allegations.

          Stormy Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti has a mixed record of reliability when it comes to splashy announcements. On the one hand, his claims that Donald Trump knew about the nondisclosure payment made to Daniels in 2016 and that the NDA in question was unenforceable have turned out to be correct. He was also the first person to publicize accurate claims about a series of sketchy corporate “lobbying” payments that were made to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.
        
          On the other hand, this July, Avenatti declared breathlessly that he had three other clients who received “hush money” from Trump, but he hasn’t subsequently revealed any other details about their alleged cases, even anonymously. And earlier in the year, Avenatti suggested in a TV appearance that Republican lobbyist Elliott Broidy’s admission that he’d paid NDA money to a Playboy Playmate named Shera Bechard was actually made in order to conceal someone else’s affair with Bechard—a suggestion that seemed to imply that the “someone else” in question was Trump.* That theory, later laid out explicitly in print by others, does not appear to be true.
        
          Avenatti, in any case, is now saying he has a new client who is ready to make some sort of accusation related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh:
        
          (Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford says Judge, a classmate of Kavanaugh’s, was present during her assault. He denies any knowledge of the incident.)
        
          Avenatti told the Hill Monday that he “anticipate[s]” that this client will go public within the next two days but that he has not yet “finalized the details.”
        
          One thing about celebrity lawyers is that they don’t necessarily suffer when a bold public claim they’ve made turns out not to be fully supported by the facts—in fact, such an event can still be a big win for them because it’s gotten them on TV, which makes them more famous, which means more potential clients have heard of them.
        
          In summary, either Avenatti’s current claim will pan out and be newsworthy, or it won’t!

          Collins reaffirmed her belief—despite the massive enthusiasm social conservatives have for Kavanaugh—that Roe v. Wade would remain intact: “I do not believe that he’s going to repeal Roe v. Wade<U+FEFF>,” but Collins said that she was still undecided on him. “How could I decide before hearing the testimony of professor Ford?” Collins said she was “close, very close, but I’m not all the way there, and professor Ford deserves to be heard.”
        
          While Collins has bucked the Republican majority occasionally (she was one of the three Republican votes that doomed Obamacare’s repeal), she has tended to be supportive of Supreme Court nominations from Democrats and Republicans during her time in the Senate. And while she has praised Kavanaugh, she has also sided with the Republicans most insistent on Christine Ford getting a hearing before the Senate. So we’ll have to wait at least a few more days to find out which way she’ll vote—if she has to at all.

          The partisan battle lines over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination are now starker than ever following the second allegation of sexual misconduct against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. Democrats are demanding that a vote on his confirmation be put on hold for as long as it takes for the FBI to properly investigate the claims; Republicans are shrugging the whole thing off as a partisan ploy and vowing to push forward with a vote as planned.
        
          “I want to be perfectly clear what is taking place,” Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon. “Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man’s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncoordinated. That is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become: a smear campaign pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.” McConnell added: “This fine nominee will receive a vote, in the Senate, in the near future.”
        
          Utah Sen. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a former Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a current member of the panel, made the GOP’s agenda explicit in a tweet earlier Monday: “We should hear from Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford on Thursday as planned. Then we should vote.”
        
          President Trump earlier in the day described Kavanaugh as “a man with an unblemished past” and dismissed Deborah Ramirez’s claim—that Kavanaugh had exposed his penis to her during a drunken dormitory party during their first year at Yale—as “totally political.” Shortly after Hatch weighed in, Kavanaugh released his own statement dismissing the allegations much the same way Senate Republicans and the White House had.
        
          “There is now a frenzy to come up with something—anything—that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring,” Kavanaugh said in a letter to the Senate that was also made public. “The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.” Earlier Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway had also suggested the timing of the accusations were a coordinated effort. “This is starting to feel like a vast left-wing conspiracy,” she told CBS.
        
          Democrats, meanwhile, stepped up their defense both of Ford, who claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her during high school, and of Ramirez, who detailed her claim to the New Yorker. While the GOP buzzwords were smear campaign and character assassination, a number of Democrats were pushing the hashtag #BelieveSurvivors.
        
          Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel, was the first on Sunday to call for “an immediate postponement of any further proceedings” following the new allegation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then joined the Democratic chorus on Monday afternoon in his first public comments since the second allegation was made public.
        
          “There is only one way to get to the bottom of these allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the nation from being thrown into further turmoil: an independent background check investigation by the FBI,” Schumer tweeted. “If President Trump and Senate Republicans are so certain the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh aren’t true, then why are they blocking the FBI from reopening the background check and investigating—a routine practice for judicial nominees? What are they hiding?”
        
          Kavanaugh and Ford are both still scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. As the polarization deepens, anything could happen between now and then.

          A day after a new allegation of sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh became public, President Trump told reporters that he believed the accusation was “totally political” and said, “I am with him all the way.”
        
          Trump’s comments came after he made remarks at the United Nations on Monday morning. They followed those made by Kellyanne Conway on CBS This Morning, when she said that the allegations against Kavanaugh were “starting to feel like a vast left-wing conspiracy.”
        
          On Sunday night, the New Yorker published a story that said Senate Democrats were investigating allegations that Kavanaugh exposed himself to a woman named Deborah Ramirez at a party in college. Ramirez, like Christine Blasey Ford, is calling for the FBI to investigate the allegation.
        
          After the story was published, Kavanaugh denied the allegation, and the White House released a statement defending the nominee:
        
          After Sen. Dianne Feinstein called for a postponement of the confirmation proceedings, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said he would “look into” the new allegations and asked for it to be referred to the FBI for investigation, according to CNN. But he and Kellyanne Conway did not say it appeared necessary to delay the proceedings. “They’ve made tremendous, unprecedented accommodations for Ms. Ford to testify Thursday,” Conway said.
        
          Conway’s defense also included the argument that Kavanaugh was being punished for decades of other men’s misconduct:
        
          She added another seemingly new argument to come from the White House, as she cast doubt that Kavanaugh would have committed sexual abuse at a time when he was not “powerful.”
        
          On Sunday, Ford confirmed that she will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.

          Sen. Dianne Feinstein is calling on Sen. Chuck Grassley to halt proceedings related to Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Feinstein sent a letter to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee on Sunday night, shortly after the New Yorker published a piece on allegations from a second woman who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
        
          In the letter, Feinstein calls for “an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.” The Democratic senator also calls for the new allegations to be referred to the FBI for an investigation. She said it was important for this investigation to be carried out by “career professionals at the FBI” rather than the “partisan staff of the Committee.” But if the White House continues “to refuse to direct the FBI to do its job, the Committee must subpoena all relevant witnesses.” Feinstein concludes her letter by noting that “it is time to set politics aside. We must ensure that a thorough and fair investigation is conducted before moving forward.”
        
          Earlier Sunday, Grassley’s office released the unredacted letter that Chrstine Blasey Ford sent to Feinstein detailing her accusations against Kavanaugh. “As you know, the letter was given to me in confidence and I am giving it to you with the expectation that you will maintain its confidentiality and that it will not be released publicly or disseminated further, as requested by Dr. Blasey Ford’s counsel Debra Katz,” Feinstein wrote in a letter to Grassley that accompanied Ford’s letter.

          Every year for the past decade, the Family Research Council has hosted the Values Voter Summit, a convention of conservative activists who vote based on traditional right-wing values. Those values are predictable: They’re opposed to gay marriage, abortion rights, and immigration; they support gun rights, tax cuts, and personhood for both fetuses and corporations.
        
          This year, there was a new value to add: the belief that sexual assault might be a morally acceptable act—or at minimum, that it is not an unequivocally immoral act. In a speech at the summit on Saturday, Gary Bauer—the former FRC president and current head of the right-wing nonprofit American Values—said that Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was “unproven and … unprovable.” But more than that, Bauer said, women “shouldn’t want a country where … the man in your life can be ruined by someone getting up and saying ‘36 years ago, he did this to me.’ ”
        
          Here, Bauer suggests that women should turn against those who claim to have survived sexual violence in order to protect their husbands and, by association, themselves. A culture that believes women when they publicly recount memories of pain, trauma, and shame is one that could expose sexual violation as commonplace—a transgression that the man to whom you’ve hitched your social and financial security has probably enabled, if not enacted. Both Ford’s story and the new allegation that Kavanaugh shoved his exposed penis in the face of an unwilling college classmate include bystanders who allegedly egged him on as he drunkenly forced himself on women. In his speech at the Values Voter Summit, Bauer tried to get women in the audience to see their husbands in those bystanders, if not in Kavanaugh himself. If conservative Christian women who’ve sublimated their desires into their husbands’ were forced to reckon with the likelihood that those men have applauded or perpetrated the things Kavanaugh and Donald Trump have been accused of doing, and if they were forced to confront those things as morally wrong, their worlds would come unmoored.
        
          While conservatives are busy reassuring themselves that sexual harassment and assault are not systemic problems because they’re not problematic at all—just horseplay, really—a parallel conversation is taking place on the left, in which women periodically dredge up and display their worst memories in hopes of kindling empathy and effecting social change. For the past few years, a pattern has emerged: Whenever a seemingly game-changing allegation becomes public, women flood social media to share stories of their own experiences with sexual assault, as if they could prove the severity of the problem through sheer numbers. The Access Hollywood tape of Trump bragging about groping women’s genitals prompted women to tweet about the first time they were sexually violated, using the hashtag #notokay. The ghastly allegations against Harvey Weinstein inspired people around the world to relive their memories of harassment and assault with #MeToo, an attempt to demonstrate that big-name alleged rapists like Weinstein were just the tip of the iceberg. When Roy Moore was accused by several women of abusing young teenagers and pursuing relationships with them while a prosecutor in his 30s, women tweeted photos of themselves at 14 years old (#MeAt14) to illustrate that 14 is too young to meaningfully consent to sexual contact with a 32-year-old man. Before all that, there was #YesAllWomen, which endeavored to show the pervasiveness of gender-based violence and harassment in response to the 2014 Isla Vista, California, murders carried out by a young man who’d found a home for his hatred of women within the incel and men’s rights movements.
        
          On Friday, a new sexual assault–related hashtag, #WhyIDidntReport, took hold on Twitter. Its origin was a Trump tweet that questioned why Ford or her parents didn’t report Kavanaugh to the police in 1982 if his alleged assault “was as bad as she says.” The hashtag’s assumption seemed earnest and a bit naïve: that perhaps there are people out there who spend time on Twitter, follow women who tweet about sexual assault, think women are lying about a decades-old sexual assault they didn’t report, but are still somehow willing to believe other women’s stories of sexual violence and possibly change their minds. Perhaps! But it’s far more likely that people sympathetic to Trump’s skepticism of women who don’t file police reports about sexual assault will continue to roll their eyes. Those who think like Trump are far more likely to see easily triggered women who refuse to take responsibility for their own sexual behavior than they are to let a series of tweets awaken them to structural barriers to sexual-assault reporting.
        
          Women on the right are no more likely than their male counterparts to be moved by a Twitter campaign of women recounting their own sexual traumas. For conservative women, rejecting the notion of sexual violence as pervasive and wrong is integral to preserving their sense of self and community belonging. Another speaker at this year’s Values Voter Summit, the anti-Islam, anti-gay vlogger known as Activist Mommy, is a prime example of the kind of anti-feminism that Christian conservatives offer women. In a December 2017 video on “the sexual harassment movement,” Activist Mommy calls #MeToo “an assault on men and masculinity” and on “natural love between men and women.” She posits that a woman who willingly enters her boss’s hotel room is just as guilty as the boss who then forces himself on her, that such women are “Jezebels,” and that the women who accused Matt Lauer of sexual harassment “betrayed Matt’s wife.”
        
          This worldview would have survivors of sexual violence, including Christian conservative ones, blame themselves instead of their assailants, as so many already do. In a community that fetishizes male authority in the church, the home, and the workplace, a sexual power structure infected by male aggression seems unobjectionable, even natural. The arguments Phyllis Schlafly was making in 1981—“sexual harassment on the job is not a problem for the virtuous woman”—are the same ones conservative women like Activist Mommy and Candace Owens are using now to sow fear of a #MeToo movement that casts any woman with a husband as a potential future Ashley Estes Kavanaugh or Annette Roque. If sexual misconduct’s definition is so narrow and the threshold for believability and fault is so high that only Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby qualify, women won’t ever have to confront the politically inconvenient reality—and personally devastating realization—of a society simultaneously full of and indifferent to sexual violation.
        
          But there is some utility to the #WhyIDidntReport and #YesAllWomen and #MeAt14 and #MeToo hashtags, even if they never inspire a surge of defectors to abandon Trumpism and the right-wing dogma that regards sexual assault as both a rarity and no big whoop. The hashtags and the abusive patterns that prompt them have set in motion a cycle of female emotional excavation and self-examination, a recurring reminder of the battles feminists have yet to win. They help women place isolated incidents in the context of systemic power imbalances and forestall complacency by keeping emotions fresh.
        
          The cultural conversations that surrounded each of these hashtags have resurfaced long-submerged memories for some women and pushed others to reassess and recategorize transgressions they once waved away as benign. When a slew of women came forward with sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump in October 2016, then–Slate columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote that Trump had “shaken a psychic snow globe, and now flickers of half-remembered horror are floating through the atmosphere all around us.” Calls and online chats to a rape and abuse hotline spiked in the days after the Access Hollywood video came out. The #MeToo movement and the wave of public accusations that followed motivated many women, myself included, to confront the men in our lives who’d never had to answer for their exploitative behavior. The moment has also pushed former victims to relinquish the self-blame that accompanies a sexual assault processed alone. Deborah Copaken wrote in the Atlantic last week that the initial Kavanaugh allegations led her to contact the man who date-raped her in college. She accepted his 30-years-late apology. The most recent allegation against Kavanaugh will no doubt remind even more women of similar incidents from their college years and provoke a similar reckoning.
        
          It’s extraordinarily painful to realize and admit that a disturbing memory you tucked away in the category of boys being boys was textbook sexual assault. It’s confusing to comprehend that a long-ago event that caused you no physical or emotional harm may have nonetheless been an act of sexual exploitation. It’s exhausting and distracting to be faced every few months with a wall of tweets that remind you of the times you felt weakest and destroyed. And it’s profoundly dispiriting to realize that this is the new normal—that women will keep offering vivid descriptions of their dehumanization in hopes that right-wing defenders of the likes of Trump, Kavanaugh, and Moore will listen, and that those women will keep getting brushed off as hysterical, asking-for-it, overdramatic, angry, man-hating opportunists.
        
          But pain may still predicate a foundation for healing, and consciousness-raising has its place even if it never wins any converts. Where women once got an Anita Hill–grade moment of galvanizing anger once a decade, they now get one every few months. With the GOP salivating over the empty Supreme Court seat, the fast-approaching midterms, and the 2020 elections not far behind, the chronic agony of sexual-violence hashtags may provide the fuel female activists need to keep up the fight. We don’t have to tell each other to stay woke when the periodic invitation to revisit our trauma makes it impossible to get any rest at all.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/deborah-ramirez-second-woman-alleges-kavanaugh-sexual-misconduct-this-time-while-he-was-in-college.html,"
          The New Yorker published an explosive story Sunday night reporting that Senate Democrats are investigating a fresh allegation of sexual misconduct involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. This latest claim involves Kavanaugh’s actions while he was a freshman at Yale University and was put forward by Deborah Ramirez, who attended college with Kavanaugh and claims he exposed himself at a drunken party and “thrust his penis in her face.” That action allegedly led Ramirez to touch his penis without her consent while she was pushing him away. Ramirez, 53, is now calling on the FBI to investigate.
        
          Ramirez seems to have gone thorugh a lot of soul searching before deciding to come forward to tell her story. At first she was reluctant to speak publicly, saying her memory was hazy because she had been drinking. But after “six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney,” Ramirez decided to come forward, saying she felt confident that it was Kavanaugh who had exposed himself to her. The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer summarize what Ramirez claims took place:
        
          Kavanaugh vehemently denies the allegation and the White House is obviously standing by its nominee. The New Yorker talked to several classmates, some of whom say they heard about the incident at the time while others deny that it ever took place. One classmate, who refused to be identified, said he heard about the incident at the time and was “one hundred percent sure” that he was told at the time that Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself to Ramirez.
        
          Beyond the specific instance it seems several Yale alumni have been discussing Kavanaugh’s behavior in college, a time when the judge apparently liked to drink a lot. One former classmate who said he never witnessed Kavanaugh engage in any sort of sexual misconduct did say the Supreme Court nominee was “frequently, incoherently drunk.” Ramirez said she didn’t talk much about the incident over the years because she blamed herself for drinking too much at the party. “I didn’t want any of this,” she said. “But now I have to speak.”
        
          It seems more women could be coming forward with allegations of misconduct. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for adult-film star Stormy Daniels, wrote on Twitter that he represents “a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.” He later clarified the woman is not Ramirez. The New Yorker published its story mere hours after confirmation that Christine Blasey Ford will be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were both in high school.

          Shopping for calendars can be a difficult and emotionally fraught experience: No other decision a consumer makes expresses more about who they are as a person than the calendar they choose, whether it’s bound in calfskin, etched into Aztec stone, or supposedly waiting patiently in a D.C.-area attic for decades. And that’s especially true when—for reasons too complicated to go into here—that calendar has to be from 1982, and the message it has to send is “Although I am a carefree and relatable youngster now, someday I will deserve a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, regardless of anything you might hear about what I was up to in 1982.” To help you make the best choice for yourself—and for this great nation—Slate is proud to present a guide to the best and worst calendars from 1982 currently for sale on eBay. Just in case you’re abruptly in the market for one.
        
          Although there’s no space to keep exonerating appointments on this calendar, there’s also no need to: No high school student who owned a calendar designed to count down to the opening day of Disney’s Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow was ever invited to a party where there was drinking. Plus, imagine the admirable continuity of character it would show if you could convince people that your dissent in John Doe VII v. Exxon Mobil Corp, in which you opined that Exxon could not be sued for hiring security forces to torture and murder Indonesians, was born at the Exxon-sponsored Universe of Energy pavilion! (Assuming you, the hypothetical reader who is shopping for calendars from 1982, wrote a dissent in that case, naturally.)
        
          This calendar literally has a drawing on the cover of a caveman carrying a woman off over his shoulder while his caveman buddies hoot and holler. Do not buy this calendar.
        
          This calendar would raise more questions than it would answer, but it would probably be more fun to answer questions about how a high school student in Washington D.C. came to have a 1982 pin-up calender of pigs from the Heinold Hog Market of Bowling Green, Missouri than it would be to answer questions about certain parties that high school student may or may not have attended, so go for it.
        
          Why do you keep suggesting this calendar? This calendar will not help you.
        
          Technically, this Rubik’s Cube perpetual calendar is a calendar from 1982, not a calendar of 1982, but it still could come in handy in certain situations. Although the calendar doesn’t provide any place to make exonerating calendar entries like, “Aug. 12: I’m not attending any attempted rape parties, you can be sure of that!” you could probably pretend to be consulting your calendar, use the motion of the Rubik’s cube to lull senators into a semi-hypnotic state, abruptly yell, “Catch!”, throw it into the crowd, and make your escape in the ensuing commotion.
        
          The perfect calendar for the man who already has all the support from Yale he can handle, but is still looking to pocket the rest of the ruling class.
        
          So confusing, it just might work!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanuagh-christine-blasey-ford-mistaken-identity.html,"
          While refusing anything so prosaic as an actual FBI investigation (which Anita Hill’s claims received when Clarence Thomas was a nominee), Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have reached a tentative agreement to hear the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, via a baroque negotiation that insists on their competence to “investigate” something like this while functionally stripping themselves of the power to actually investigate it. According to the few details we had as of the weekend, the GOP has agreed to speak only to the man and woman concerned, thus confirming that there can only ever be a “he said” and a “she said”—a situation they claim to deplore even as they deliberately engineer it. (Despite repeated requests by Ford, they have so far refused to subpoena any potential witnesses, of which there are several—even though they might theoretically help Kavanaugh’s case, since they’ve said they have no memory of the party Ford describes.) But no: Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans insist that there’s no need for witnesses, or an FBI investigation. They are constitutionally empowered to conduct this inquiry, committee leadership says.
        
          This is not a serious approach to Ford’s allegations, and senior Republicans have as much as admitted they have no intention of letting Ford’s account factor into their votes. “What am I supposed to do, go ahead and ruin this guy’s life based on an accusation?” Sen. Lindsey Graham hyperbolized on Fox News Sunday—an unintentionally clear invocation of the fact that for powerful white men, not getting a promotion is what counts as life-ruining. Still, he said, “she should come forward. She should have her say. She will be respectfully treated.” This is contradictory rot. And this worldview—not the allegation alone—is partly what’s on trial right now. The habits of mind that make it possible to tell a woman you plan to ignore everything she says and call that “respectful treatment” are the same as those that allow the Lindsey Grahams and Orrin Hatches of the world to call men like Rob Porter “decent.”
        
          It’s worth watching, then, how the GOP implodes through the internal pressure of their own oxymoronic mixed messaging: loudly announcing their indifference to a nominee’s alleged attempted rape while just as loudly promising to investigate it. They hope (and even more remarkably, expect) that the tentative hearing they’ve agreed to will offer decent cover for their preordained votes. On the other side of all this is Ford, whose account has not changed, and who has—after suffering an inundation of threats—had to go into hiding while trying to negotiate with an intimidating and hostile body the conditions under which she will testify. On Friday, the day Grassley demanded she answer him in one of several ultimatums, she was meeting with the FBI over death threats she’d received.
        
          Republicans on the outside, meanwhile, have generated a hurricane of stories to refute Ford’s allegation that she was assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh when they were teenagers. There are roughly four. A) There is no proof, and we cannot know what happened. B) It didn’t happen, and she’s a liar. C) It happened, but attempted rape really isn’t that big a deal. And D) the “evil twin” theory: It happened, but her attacker was someone else. (I hesitate to even mention E, but it exists: According to Ben Carson, this is a centuries-old plot by 19th-century socialists to take over America.)
        
          I have written about C, but today I want to examine D—a line of thinking as diabolical in practice as strategic in theory, and the twisted natural result of this effort to take the accuser seriously while discrediting her. Easily the most surprising theory to emerge in this exculpatory carnival around Kavanaugh is one holding that Ford was indeed assaulted; she’s just wrong about who did it! This position ostensibly requires one to accept Ford’s account, believing her every word except her memory of who the assailant was. The advantage of this theory is that it’s palatable: It avoids calling a woman who seems credible a liar.
        
          The seeds of this argument began to trickle out as early as Sept. 17, when Sen. Orrin Hatch shared his theory that Ford must be “mistaken.” That same day, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board had written about “the vagaries of memory” and suggested that “mistaken identity is also possible.” (Research shows that the core of traumatic memory is more certain, not less.) Kavanaugh himself told Sen. Orrin Hatch that Ford had the wrong guy. On Tuesday, Ed Whelan, president of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, promised “compelling evidence” that would vindicate his good friend and old George W. Bush administration colleague Brett Kavanaugh. The next day, Whelan tweeted out Kathleen Parker’s op-ed for the Washington Post—which proposed that, per Occam’s razor, Kavanaugh must have had an evil twin.
        
          Then Thursday night, Whelan took the evil-twin theory and made it a real live boy. His speculation—which he published on Twitter after several conservative commentators had hyped it in advance, and whose particulars I will spare you—was as far-fetched and wild-eyed as True Detective and just as hollow. His Twitter thread culminated by strongly implying—while denying it was implying—that a classmate of Kavanaugh’s who vaguely resembled him was probably responsible for the attack on Ford. Once this shockingly irresponsible account came out, GOP reps tried to distance themselves. Well: not immediately. Some conservative pundits thought there must be more to it—understandably, since Whelan is a powerful and respected figure in conservative legal circles, and what he put forth was garbage.
        
          But even after Whelan apologized for his theory, which was quickly recognized as such radioactive nonsense he’s been put on a leave of absence by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, questions remain about its genesis. The theory is developing into a second scandal, in other words: If Whelan’s good friend Kavanaugh, say, had anything to do with this effort to frame a classmate to exonerate himself, well—it would be beyond disqualifying. It will be important, going forward, to establish who knew about this particularly vicious version of the evil twin theory. So far, it’s unclear. Whelan denied that he shared the specifics of his plan with the White House and Kavanaugh, but he left out the Senate. It feels improbable that he would have cooked up such a crazy concoction alone in a lab, with everyone else trumpeting it on blind faith.
        
          And indeed, by Friday afternoon it turned out the lone wolf act was to be too good to be true: Whelan had at least been working with CRC Public Relations, a firm closely connected to the Federalist Society (which plays gatekeeper to conservative judicial picks) whose accomplishments include working with the Swift Boat Veterans in 2004 to crush John Kerry’s presidential run. Nor is Whelan’s claim to be working in isolation exactly bolstered by the revelation, made Friday night, that Whelan found Ford’s LinkedIn profile before her name had been made public. Within 90 minutes of the Washington Post’s privately sharing Ford’s name with a White House spokesman, Whelan had searched for and found her page. There are also questions about how Whelan somehow knew the address of the other party attendees and the name of the Kavanaugh classmate he potentially libeled.
        
          Your mileage may vary, but that doesn’t sound—to me—like a lack of coordination.
        
          Maybe all these people came up with the same ludicrously implausible evil-twin theory at the same time through sheer coincidence—kind of like how Leibniz and Newton just happened to invent calculus independently. Maybe Whelan was the only guy to take it to the “next level.” But whether this was conspiracy of coincidence matters less than the fact that the entire Kavanaugh apparatus seemed ready to take the evil-twin theory on board. This isn’t one man’s mistake. It’s systemic bad faith.
        
          But the reality is that this is all an ugly, desperate mess. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and his ilk have shown no desire to find the truth. Forced into a hearing at the insistence of senators like Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski, they’ve structured it not to bring the truth to light, but to do the least damage. Grassley refused Ford a real investigation on the grounds that the Senate is enough: “The job of assessing and investigating a nominee’s qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone,” he said. And as he was saying this, the Chief Counsel for Nominations Mike Davis was writing, “Unfazed and determined. We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh,” in a since-deleted Tweet. They, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (“Kavanaugh will be on the Supreme Court”), couldn’t be clearer: This hearing is purely for show.
        
          It’s worth trying to imagine what this must feel like to Ford. Hearing the Senate’s power brokers proclaim their refusal to even consider her testimony in their decision-making—she and her husband sleeping in hotels away from their children while Grassley accuses her of stalling and the Wall Street Journal and a clutch of other venues suggest, repeatedly and on the basis of nothing, not even a single testimony, that she has the wrong man. Imagine being vilified for false accusations and then watching those very people make their own. It’s to Ford’s credit that the same night Whelan’s thread went viral that she managed to issue a statement clarifying that she knew both Kavanaugh and the other boy. “There is zero chance that I would confuse them,” she said.
        
          The woman whose alleged assault is about to be “investigated” by these strategy-crazed politicos has remained quiet but steadfast—even as she tries to inject a modicum of seriousness into the process by asking (for example) that they interrogate witnesses. As these guys proliferate theories and throw spaghetti at the wall, her account remains modest and incomplete but consistent.
        
          The talk about “last-minute timing” is bilge: Her record on this is clear. She mentioned the attack to her therapist back in 2012. She contacted her representative about her concerns on July 6, when Kavanaugh was still just one of several potential nominees. She wrote to Sen. Dianne Feinstein at the end of July, requesting confidentiality, but finally came forward in September when it was clear her name was about to become public anyway. While Republicans posit secret societies, vast conspiracies, and evil twins, she has not changed her basic account, nor has she claimed to remember things she doesn’t. In response to Republican pressure, insinuation, and outright accusation, she has asserted her story and her right to fairness simply and directly. All she has done is request that her claim be investigated in full by competent authorities who can be believed to be acting in good faith.
        
          Despite the GOP’s best effort to disparage her communications as delay tactics, Ford’s requests of the committee—asking for an independent investigation, requesting certain conditions for the hearing, some of which were denied, and then agreeing to testify with final details still being worked out as of Saturday—have been reasonable and prompt for an ordinary person gearing up to face what Anita Hill did almost three decades ago. Republican commentators disagree: They seem to think she couldn’t be asking time for herself; it must be for the sake of the Democrats who she’s been smeared as helping. In a system populated by amateur sleuths like Whelan and spokesmen like Garrett Ventry (who resigned Saturday as a Grassley adviser after previous accusations of sexual harassment surfaced—and also resigned from CRC Public Relations, where he’d taken leave to help with the Kavanaugh nomination), somehow she’s the conspiracy.
        
          Republicans have done their level best to dissuade her from testifying without being too obvious (it’s hard to read their initial requirement that she testify at the same table as Kavanaugh any other way). In the interim, they’ve attempted to impugn her memory and muddy the waters with alternative theories. And yet, after all that, she’s planning to come.
        
          If anything worthwhile can be rescued from the mangled rebar of our nominations process, it will be what this one says about how America handles a sexual misconduct allegation against a potential Supreme Court Justice 27 years after the previous one.

          Christine Blasey Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her allegations that Judge Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her more than three decades ago when they were both teenagers. Ford’s lawyers said some details still need to be worked out but that won’t prevent her from testifying. “We committed to moving forward with an open hearing on Thursday Sept. 27 at 10 a.m.,” Ford’s attorneys said in a statement following a call with staff from the Senate Judiciary Committee that lasted about one hour.
        
          “Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for Senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her,” the statement read. Ford’s lawyers, Debra Katz, Lisa Banks and Michael Bromwich, also wrote that “important procedural and logistical issues remain unresolved.” Chief among them is whether Republican senators would use staff attorneys to question Ford rather than do it themselves. “We were told no decision has been made on this important issue, even though various senators have been dismissive of her account and should have to shoulder their responsibility to ask her questions,” Ford’s attorneys wrote. “Nor were we told when we would have that answer or answers to the other unresolved issues.”
        
          Ford’s attorneys also complained that lawmakers had “refused to invite other witnesses who are essential for a fair hearing that arrives at the truth about the sexual assault.” Her lawyers have been calling on the committee to subpoena testimony from Mark Judge, who Ford said was in the room during the alleged assault. They also want senators to question the former FBI agent who gave Ford a polygraph test earlier this year as well as call on two trauma experts to testify. Republicans have opposed these demands.
        
          Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley reportedly wrote an email thanking Ford for accepting the invitation. In the email, Grassley also allegedly reminded her attorneys that “the committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them. These are nonnegotiable.”
        
          The committee official scheduled the Thursday hearing on Sunday afternoon.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-ford-friend-leland-ingham-keyser-says-she-doesnt-recall-party-where-alleged-kavanaugh-assault-took-place.html,"
          A longtime friend of Christine Blasey Ford named Leland Ingham Keyser says she doesn’t know Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and doesn’t recall attending a party with him. Ford said Keyser was at the party where Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, but she says she has no memory of it. “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford,” Keyser’s lawyer, Howard Walsh, said in a statement.
        
          Keyser’s lawyer wrote the statement after she was contacted by the Senate Judiciary Committee for information about the alleged incident. “I understand that you have been identified as an individual who was in attendance at a party that occurred circa 1982 described in a recent Washington Post article,” a committee staffer wrote Keyser earlier this week. Keyser told the Washington Post in a “brief interview” that she was close friends with Ford and believes her allegations about Kavanaugh.
        
          Ford herself had told the Post she didn’t think Keyser would remember the party since she had no reason to think anything really out of the ordinary happened there. Ford’s lawyers emphasized that point after Keyser’s statement to the committee became public. “It’s not surprising that Ms. Keyser has no recollection of the evening as they did not discuss it. It’s also unremarkable that Ms. Keyser does not remember attending a specific gathering 30 years ago at which nothing of consequence happened to her. Dr. Ford of course will never forget this gathering because of what happened to her there,” Ford’s attorney, Debra Katz, said.
        
          The White House, however, is using this denial to cast doubt on Ford’s claim. Spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said: “One week ago, Dr. Christine Ford claimed she was assaulted at a house party attended by four others. Since then, all four of these individuals have provided statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee denying any knowledge of the incident or even having attended such a party.” In addition to Keyser, two other people who were allegedly at the party where the assault took place say they have no memory of the incident.
        
          While Republicans are quickly seizing on these statements to question Ford’s credibility, Sen. Dick Durbin agrees with Ford’s lawyers, saying Sunday that there is “no reason” for the other people who were allegedly at the party to remember the event. “It’s no surprise, if another person was … in the house that night and had no occurrence like the one that was stated by Dr. Ford, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t even remember that party scene 36 years ago,” Durbin said on ABC’s This Week.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-opposition-to-trumps-supreme-court-nominee-grows.html,"
          Support among voters for Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court is on the decline as more people believe Christine Blasey Ford’s claims of sexual assault than his denials. A Fox News poll released Sunday appears to confirm the trend as it shows that 50 percent of registered voters oppose Kavanaugh’s confirmation while 40 percent are in favor. That marks an increase in opposition from last month, when voters were pretty evenly split, with 45 percent approving the confirmation compared to 46 percent who were against.
        
          As could be expected, support for Kavanaugh is split along party lines with 81 percent of Republicans supporting the confirmation and 82 percent of Democrats opposing it. Significantly though, support for Kavanaugh’s confirmation among independents has plunged 12 points since August.
        
          This decline in support among independents comes as more people say they believe Ford. While 36 percent of voters say they believe Ford’s claims, only 30 percent believe Kavanaugh’s denials and 34 percent say they aren’t sure about who’s telling the truth.
        
          The Fox News poll isn’t the first to show American voters are opposed to Kavanaugh’s confirmation. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from earlier this week found that opposition to Kavanaugh’s confirmation increased nine points since last month, with 38 percent saying they’re against it and 34 percent are in favor. This marks the first time since the NBC/WSJ poll began in 2005 that a Supreme Court nominee has more opposition than support among voter.
        
          A USA Today/Ipsos Public Affairs poll also found an “unprecedented level of disapproval for a nominee to the nation’s high court” as 40 percent of Americans say the Senate shouldn’t confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, compared to 31 percent who think it should. This marks the “first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began,” according to USA Today. Ultimately, “Kavanaugh is the least liked Supreme Court nominee since Robert Bork in 1987,” notes CNN.

          OK, I’ll begin laying out some information concerning God’s allegations against Cain.
        
          Abel may well have been the victim of a severe murdering by someone 13,000 years ago. His allegations are so vague as to such basic matters as when and where that it is impossible for Cain to “prove” his innocence. But there are compelling reasons to believe his categorical denial. Let’s look at one set of reasons.
        
          According to Genesis, the murder occurred “in the field.” The “only other two human suspects on the planet at the time” that God has identified are Adam and Eve. Neither of the two lived in the vicinity of a field. Adam’s home was 3.6 miles away from the nearest field, Eve’s 4.3 miles. Here is part of Joseph Moxon’s 1695 “Paradise. Or the Garden of Eden. With the Countries curcumjacent Inhabited by the PATRIARCHS,” showing Adam and Eve’s original home, the new home an angel with a flaming sword drove them to, and no fields.
        
          Here is a house that is less than a half-mile from a field. Street address: 216 Emory St., Baltimore, MD.
        
          Here is the field’s floor plan:
        
          The floor plan corresponds closely to God’s description of the field where the murdering took place. Here’s “left field,” which is right next to “center field” and the “in field.”
        
          At the lowest point of the field, altitude-wise, is the earth. This matches God’s account of the earth “which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood.” Compare and contrast:
        
          Who lived in this house near a field? George “Babe” Ruth, a member of the legendary 1927 New York Yankees batting lineup known as “Murderer’s Row.”
        
          Folks who knew both Babe Ruth and Cain in high school have commented on how much they resembled each other in appearance. Here are Cain and Babe Ruth in their younger days:
        
          And here are Cain and Babe Ruth as adults:
        
          Cain categorically denies being in the field and committing the murder. Beyond being vouched for by literally 25% of the human population at the time before Abel’s death, a number that rose to 33% soon after, Cain has also informed God that he has no recollection of being appointed his “brother’s keeper.”
        
          Abel has not been heard from.
        
          To be clear, I have no idea what, if anything, did or did not happen in that field, and I therefore do not state, imply, or insinuate that Babe Ruth murdered Abel somewhere in left field of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, although the phrase, “Babe Ruth murdered Abel” does have a certain ring to it, which I do not state, imply, or insinuate means that Babe Ruth murdered Abel, and take no responsibility for anyone who reads this getting the idea that Babe Ruth murdered Abel just because I keep repeating the phrase “Babe Ruth murdered Abel” without, as previously noted, stating, implying, or insinuating that Babe Ruth murdered Abel. That should clear me of any possible legal consequences for floating this theory!
        
          Further, if God is now mistakenly remembering Babe Ruth to be Cain, I offer no view whether that mistaken remembrance dates from the time Babe Ruth murdered Abel, or from some time in the intervening years after Babe Ruth murdered Abel, in this hypothetical scenario in which Babe Ruth murdered Abel, which, again, I would never think of stating, implying, or insinuating.
        
          It is regrettable that a private citizen, Babe Ruth, is being drawn into this. But it’s not as though I drew his name at random and decided to frame him for a felony for short-term political gain. That would not only be unethical, it would open me up to all sorts of lawsuits, while making my entire political movement even more of a pathetic laughingstock than it already is.
        
          Bottom line: I believe that a fair assessment of the evidence powerfully supports Cain’s categorical denial, and that this utterly insane collection of floor plans and photographs will somehow convince other people to agree with me. I will not be taking questions at this time.

          Minutes before a 2:30 p.m. deadline on Saturday, Christine Blasey Ford agreed that she would testify before Congress next week about her claims that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two of them were in high school. Lawyers representing Ford wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying that their client “accepts” the request to testify but expressed optimism they would be able to negotiate conditions at the hearing.
        
          A few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Ford’s lawyers reportedly reached a tentative agreement for her to publicly testify on Thursday in what the New York Times characterized as “an apparent breakthrough in halting negotiations.” Although there were still lots of details to work out, the concession by Republicans to allow Ford to testify Thursday seemed to be a confirmation that they want the public session to take place. Negotiations between the committee and Ford’s lawyers are set to continue Sunday.
        
          “Dr. Ford accepts the Committee’s request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct next week,” Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, wrote in the afternoon message to the committee. “We are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details,” they added. “Can we set up a time for later this afternoon to continue our negotiations?” The lawyers also said they were “disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process.” Blasey’s attorneys say she wanted to appear before the committee on Thursday, according to the New York Times, but that is one of many details that still have to be decided.
        
          Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley had given Ford a deadline of 10 p.m. on Friday to decide whether she would testify. Ford’s attorney Katz responded with a strongly worded letter criticizing the “aggressive and artificial deadlines” as an attempt “to bully Dr. Ford.” Grassley agreed to an extension and proceeded to write a tweet that looked like an apology to Kavanaugh. “Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate,” he wrote.“She shld decide so we can move on I want to hear her. I hope u understand. It’s not my normal approach to b indecisive.” Grassley also complained that he felt like he was “playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductor.”
        
          Republicans were immediately skeptical about Ford’s agreement to testify, with some questioning whether the letter amounted to a stalling tactic. “Our view of this latest response from Ford through her attorney is still ambiguous. She says she’s willing to testify but she says she still wants negotiations,” a senior White House official told Politico. “Until there’s actually an agreement, there isn’t. It could be a another delay tactic.” Vice President Mike Pence expressed support for Kavanaugh on Saturday, telling a crowd at the Values Voters Summit that Kavanaugh “is a man of integrity, with impeccable credentials and a proven judicial philosophy.”

          A media adviser that was working with the Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee to get Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh confirmed has resigned from his position after questions about claims of previous sexual harassment allegations against him. Garrett Ventry, 29, who served as a communications aide to the committee, stepped down after NBC News asked him about evidence that he had been fired from a previous job due to a sexual harassment claim against him.
        
          NBC reported that Ventry had been fired a few months into a job as a social media adviser for North Carolina House Majority Leader John Bell in 2017. Sources told NBC News that Ventry had been fired because “parts of his resume were found to have been embellished, and because he faced an accusation of sexual harassment from a female employee of the North Carolina General Assembly’s Republican staff.” Ventry denied any past “allegations of misconduct” in a statement to NBC.
        
          Ventry was also a former employee of CRC Public Relations, according to Politico that details how the powerful company played a key role in guiding conservative legal activist Ed Whelan on how to roll out a crazy conspiracy theory that was supposed to exonerate Kavanaugh. Whelan has since apologized and deleted the theory that he had laid out in a Twitter thread. Ventry began working for the committee after the Federalist Society called on the CRC to send someone over to assist the nomination process, reports Politico.
        
          Even though Ventry “strongly denies allegations of wrongdoing, he decided to resign to avoid causing any distraction from the work of the committee,” Judiciary Committee Spokesman Taylor Foy said in a statement. But sources said Republican leaders became concerned that Ventry’s history meant he couldn’t be an effective spokesman for Kavanaugh’s nomination.
        
          Ventry had appeared on Fox News just a few days ago to detail the efforts that had been made to get Christine Blasey Ford to testify about her claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party more than three decades ago when the two were in high school.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-response-grassley-committee-deadline.html,"
          Update, 12:30 a.m., Sept. 22: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley sent a series of late night tweets extending the negotiations for Christine Blasey Ford’s potential testimony, ending on a familiarly rueful-sounding note:
        
          Original Post: The Senate Judiciary Committee tried to initiate a Friday night game of chicken with attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The committee had issued a 10 p.m. ultimatum for Ford to agree to testify by Wednesday, stating that the vote to confirm Kavanaugh would proceed on Monday without her agreement. Ford’s lawyers did not bite.
        
          Ford’s attorney Debra S. Katz responded to the ultimatum with a strongly-worded letter decrying the “aggressive and artificial deadlines” as an attempt “to bully Dr. Ford.” Katz explains that Ford had “traveled to meet with the FBI for several hours about the death threats she had been receiving,” and that her legal team requested time “to be able to provide you with a well-considered response.”
        
          “Your cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,” Katz writes, “is completely inappropriate.”
        
          Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s office had sent a letter to Ford’s lawyers earlier on Friday “providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford’s attorneys don’t respond (by 10 p.m. tonight) or Dr. Ford decides not to testify.” That deadline was not the first of the day set by the committee; earlier Friday afternoon it had demanded a response from Ford by the more business-friendly 5 p.m.
        
          Ford’s attorneys have been negotiating with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee over the past week regarding the conditions under which Ford would testify. Yesterday, Ford agreed to testify no earlier than next Thursday if the conditions were safe and fair. Members of the Republican-led committee and their staffers have been explicit in their desire to expedite Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, and earlier this week the committee had rejected Ford’s requests for an FBI investigation into the alleged assault.
        
          According to the Washington Post’s Seung Min Kim, the Friday letter from Grassley’s office also elaborated on specific requests from Ford’s lawyers and whether or not the Senate Judiciary Committee would honor them.
        
          As of 11 p.m., the Senate Judiciary Committee had not issued a statement regarding its 10 p.m. deadline.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/blasey-ford-kavanaugh-fbi-investigation-credibility.html,"
          On this week’s Political Gabfest, David Plotz and Emily Bazelon are joined by David French, senior fellow at the National Review Institute, to discuss the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. A transcript of this conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, is below.
        
          David Plotz: Should Christine Blasey Ford testify on Monday?
        
          Emily Bazelon: I think the request for an investigation is a completely reasonable one and makes sense if you’re trying to ascertain the truth of these accusations. That’s what investigators do: They look into surrounding circumstances and look for corroborating evidence. This accusation is about something that took place 36 years ago, and it’s possible that people aren’t going to remember whether this party happened, when it was, etc. But at least one would want to allow investigators a chance to try to sort that out, especially because Kavanaugh has said that he wasn’t at this party. And that seems like something that it’s possible to at least find out more about.
        
          So I understand why Blasey’s asking for the investigation. I think Republicans are going to refuse to do it, which seems to clearly be their position—none of the Republican senators who asked for the hearing, meaning Flake and Corker and Collins and Murkowski, are demanding an investigation. I think the Republicans have decided that the politics don’t force them to do one.
        
          And in that case, I think that if Blasey wants to try to have an effect on this confirmation, then she has to testify on Monday. Whether she decides to do that or not, that’s her personal decision. I’m not going to tell her to do, but I think that’s sort of how the politics have landed at the moment.
        
          Plotz: Do you think this merits an FBI investigation before any Senate Judiciary Committee testimony? Or do you think that the testimony should go ahead with the two of them?
        
          David French: No, I don’t think it merits an FBI investigation. Let’s be clear about what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about investigating what would have been a violation of state criminal law more than 30 years ago, something that the FBI doesn’t investigate.
        
          Now, when we’re talking about investigation, people keep acting as if the FBI is the only entity that can investigate. No, the Senate committee itself can investigate. The Senate committee staff, both majority staff and minority staff, can investigate. A plaintiff can investigate. A plaintiff’s attorney can investigate. There are many different avenues of investigation here.
        
          One thing I think is pretty clear, and from what I’m hearing, is I do not believe that Republicans senators are sitting there going, “I can’t wait for her testify in front of us so that we can destroy her on national television.” Many of them view her testifying on national television as an extremely high-risk endeavor for the nominee and for the GOP. There is a view that if she comes, and she testifies in public, and she’s very compelling, that this could absolutely sink the nomination.
        
          But at the same time, they also know you cannot possibly vote on this nominee without offering this testimony. So I think they are going to continue to offer up right up until the deadline, and at the same time, you would hope that these committee staffs are busy doing their jobs investigating this all the while.
        
          Listen to Slate’s Political Gabfest via Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, Stitcher, or Google Play.
        
          Bazelon: Maybe I’m a little confused about your position. Because a couple weeks ago, you were saying, “If there were only four boys there, where are the other two? Let’s hear from them. In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.” So are you saying that the FBI should not investigate, but somebody should? Or that the hearing should just go ahead on Monday without an investigation?
        
          French: No, I’m saying an investigation should be conducted by the relevant committee. If you’re going to say, “There should be an investigation, and only the FBI should investigate,” when this is not in the FBI’s standard operating procedure, I think that’s a problem. But it is absolutely within the purview of these committees to do these kinds of investigations, and from what I understand, at least the majority staff has been doing these investigations, has talked to Kavanaugh under penalty of felony, has received correspondence from at least two of the other people who were allegedly at the party who say they don’t remember a party like this. So there is something going on behind the scenes that is not highly visible to us, and the FBI, typically, doesn’t investigate alleged violations of state laws.
        
          Bazelon: But in this context, the FBI does background checks of every Supreme Court nominee and did investigate Anita Hill’s allegations about Clarence Thomas. In fact, according to the White House at the time, they were unfounded.
        
          I’m a little confused. If Kavanaugh is innocent, I would think he would welcome an investigation to clear his name. So that part of it puzzles me, but I also think from Blasey Ford’s point of view, the Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a neutral source of investigation. Some of the senators have already said that they believe Kavanaugh. I think what she is asking for here is to have some neutral fact-finders.
        
          French: But you also have the minority staff empowered to investigate as well.
        
          Bazelon: But those are both of the entity, the majority and minority parts of the committee. And what Blasey Ford is asking for is a neutral investigator, and that seems to me to be different from just saying, “Oh, a particular entity, the FBI.”
        
          Plotz: The Senate is holding a hearing to decide whether they want to confirm him for the Supreme Court. This isn’t a criminal investigation. This is not an attempt to open a criminal investigation against him. It’s a process designed to decide on confirmation. And I feel like if the Senate rules as set by the majority of senators are, Here’s how we’re going to do it, even if they’re tinged with partisan bias, why not just go ahead with this? She can make her point as she testifies: Here’s why this is an inadequate investigation. And here’s what should be looked into. But I don’t know that she’s necessarily entitled to this kind of investigation.
        
          Bazelon: I don’t know what the word entitled in that sentences means. And I also feel like I’m repeating myself. But if you really want to try find out the facts here, as David French wrote a week or two ago, you would investigate. And the idea of having a neutral investigative body that more people might trust their findings seems totally sensible to me.
        
          We already have a situation in which people are lining up on one side of believe him or believe her with a lot of partisan bias informing their choices about that matter. So if there is some hope here of finding out other facts that could help people see this in a more neutral way, that would seem important to me.
        
          One other related question I have about this is the decision to only call two witnesses when there’s a third person, Mark Judge, who according to Blasey Ford was in the room, and who is someone who supports Kavanaugh’s version of events. It just seems to me the decision not to call Judge has everything to do with Judge’s character and the fact that he wrote two memoirs about his alcoholism and blackout drinking. And if they call Judge, they’re going to say to him, Hey, there was a character in your book who you called Bart O’Kavanaugh, who you talked about puking and passing out from alcohol. Is that Brett Kavanaugh?
        
          The Republicans don’t want that guy testifying in front of the American people. But again, if you were really trying to ascertain the truth here and figure out who’s credible and whose stories hold up, of course you would call that third person. And anyone else you could find who was supposed to be at that party.
        
          Plotz: Why do you think Judge, in particular, shouldn’t be called on Monday, if you do think that?
        
          French: I don’t think that. I think that if you can identify people who were allegedly at that party they should be called, and they should testify. I look at this in a way that is very similar to the process of civil litigation because there’s no prospect of prosecuting a crime here. That ship sailed a long time ago. And in the process of civil litigation, a person comes forward with an accusation and then bears a burden of proof. And the burden of proof I articulated in an article when all this just first broke on Sunday was the lowest burden of proof possible in court. And that is preponderance of the evidence or more likely than not.
        
          Because I don’t want to have a Supreme Court justice sitting on the Supreme Court if it is more likely than not that they committed this heinous of a sexual assault even when they were a teenager. If it’s more likely than not that they did this, I don’t want them on the Supreme Court. In the same way with Roy Moore, I was utterly opposed to his election in Alabama because I thought it was more likely than not that he had abused underage young teenagers when he was a prosecutor in Alabama. The same reason I did not want Trump in—well, for many reasons I did not want Trump in the White House. One is I thought it’s more likely than not he was a sexual abuser, the same for Bill Clinton. That’s the standard, which I think is a fair standard, is that we don’t want someone in that office when it’s more likely than not that they did this.
        
          Well, then how do you go about establishing that? I tend to believe that the accuser, the person who comes forward with the accusation, bears the burden of proving at least that it’s more likely than not that it occurred. And one thing that troubles me that as of right now: The only people who have said anything under penalty of felony so far about this are Kavanaugh and two of the other people who were allegedly at the party. And the accuser, to this moment, has still not said anything under oath or under any penalty of felony. In a court of law that accusation would be tossed out unless the person was willing to state their case under penalty of perjury.
        
          So the staff should investigate the heck out of this thing between now and a hearing, and then they should call relevant witnesses. And if the majority doesn’t want to call relevant witnesses, then I’d say shame on them. But that is what we require of people all over this country in very, very difficult circumstances when a claim is made is to come in, put their hand in the air, swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but truth, and then make their case subject to cross-examination. That’s the way this works.
        
          Plotz: Emily, do you think if we end up with simply the two of them testifying on Monday—and maybe, as David French says, there will be a background investigation so that at least the senators will come armed with material to ask questions about—and we have one person who makes a claim, and she is credible, and we have another person who denies that claim, and he is credible, what are we left with at that point?
        
          Bazelon: I’m not sure because we haven’t heard the testimony. And I agree with David French that it’s entirely possible—and in my view, likely—that Blasey Ford is going to be a compelling and sympathetic teller of her story, and that could have a real impact, but we have to wait and see how it plays out.
        
          For me, some of the arguments people have made about why Blasey Ford doesn’t seem credible to them are not arguments that hold up to me. One of the arguments—I think, David French, you’ve made this argument—that because she waited so long to come forward, it makes it harder to prove. But to me, it doesn’t at all make it clear that she’s not telling the truth.
        
          Caitlin Flanagan did an amazing job on The Daily this week for the New York Times and in the Atlantic talking about a sexual assault she experienced that she didn’t tell anyone about. I had an experience of sexual assault in high school in the ’80s. I didn’t tell anyone. For a long time, we just didn’t do that. I felt way too much shame and responsibility to talk about it. It just seems like something that was my fault. But I know it happened to me.
        
          And I have the same response hearing President Trump and others suggest that maybe she mixed up Kavanaugh’s identity, because I would never be mixed up about the person who did that to me. So I find those efforts to undermine her story really hard to listen to.
        
          Plotz: Do you guys think that the peripheral evidence about Kavanaugh’s teenage years, his own joking about what happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep, the hints, and the Mark Judge memoir about Kavanaugh, do you think that’s going to come up? Is it relevant? Do senators need to consider that?
        
          French: I think whether or not he drank to excess on occasion in high school is—let me put it this way: If he said, “Look, there’s no way I could have done this because I was stone-cold sober all of the time, and remember with clarity where I was and what I did,” and then there was evidence, “No, in fact, you drank too much on occasion,” at some point, it gets very, very difficult to say evidence that he drank too much on occasion equals evidence that he committed a serious act of sexual assault.
        
          One of the problems that we have here, I think, is when you lack a lot of evidence, one way or the other, we begin to fill in the void with our own experience. And I think that’s one of the reasons why some of the articles—for example, Caitlin’s article that you referenced earlier—have been so, so powerful for so many people because it resonates so much with their own experiences.
        
          In the absence of a whole lot of evidence to really sit there and weigh and carefully consider, you begin to import your experience in these things. And I think that’s just a very human thing that we all do, but it’s a thing that we do in the absence of evidence. And when that occurs, it ramps up what’s already an intense, emotional, high-stakes confirmation battle, political battle, and it becomes something else entirely. It becomes a big cultural moment. And we’ve seen this many, many times.
        
          And so, no, I don’t say that there’s a lack of contemporary corroborating evidence means that she’s lying. I’m saying, more from a legal standpoint, that it is a lack of additional evidence that is of consequence if you were going to be making this case in court, and that’s where I’m going with that.
        
          Bazelon: Making this into a cultural moment sounds like it’s very mushy and being propelled by a few individual anecdotal narratives, so I want to bring in this smart article by Sandra Newman in Quartz about the relative rarity of false rape accusations, which is something that I’ve also written about. It’s a really low rate of women—or anyone, men too, whoever—who come into police stations and report a rape falsely, and we’ve known that for a while. But added to this picture, which I thought was really valuable, is that when people do make false accusations, they usually have a history of fraud or mental illness, or sometimes there’s a clear motivation of revenge, something that allows the facts to unravel pretty quickly and shows that there is some external motivation behind the false claim. And also usually the false claims are really florid. They’re highly dramatic accounts of rape, like the claim that the UVA student made in the Rolling Stone piece that fell apart, which we’ve talked a lot about on this show.
        
          People rarely makes claims of things that could be mistaken for consent, and that’s the kind of claim Blasey Ford is making here. So I think that’s an important set of not just a few anecdotal narratives, but some data to add to this picture that to me balance against this notion that Blasey Ford isn’t telling the truth.
        
          French: There’s one problem with those studies: Our legal system does not adjudicate for falsity. If a jury acquits, for example, a rape defendant, they adjudicate the claim to be false. They say that the burden of proof wasn’t met. If a prosecutor declines to proceed with a case, or if a judge grants a summary judgment motion in a sexual harassment case, a civil sexual assault–type case, there’s not an adjudication of falseness. There’s a failure to meet—or a believed failure to meet—a burden of proof.
        
          So all of these studies that say, X percent are false, there’s a methodological problem there because that’s not what our system adjudicates for. You can have a situation, and this happens all the time, where a person isn’t a false accuser, in other words, they’re not deliberately making a false claim, but they’re making a claim that is insufficient to meet the burden of proof sometimes for reasons due to their own memory, sometimes for reasons due to conflicting evidence, sometimes for many reasons.
        
          I don’t think outside of the fever swamps on the right, I haven’t seen too many people sitting here saying that Ford is maliciously sitting back there and making all this up. What I am seeing is more people saying that based on the totality of the evidence, it appears that she might be mistaken about one or more elements.
        
          Bazelon: You were talking before about a situation of proving rape beyond a reasonable doubt. And it is absolutely true that rape is a famously hard charge to prove. But the notion that then one moved there to the idea that there is some large number of false rape accusations out there, we just don’t have any evidence for that. It’s just like canard.
        
          When you say that you think that Blasey Ford could be mistaken—that’s a very delicate way of putting it—what do you think she’s mistaken about?
        
          French: She could be mistaken about identity of the attacker. She could be mistaken about the exact circumstances of the things that happened in the room. She could be mistaken about the amount of alcohol that various people, including herself, consumed.
        
          One of the things that’s really interesting about memory is that—and this is a hard truth for people to understand because nobody doubts their own memory—if you say to somebody, “The thing that you remember is one of the most important things in your life, you could be remembering that incorrectly,” people get really upset about that. And they say, “That’s just not possible.” But everything that we know about memory says not only is that possible, but that is frequently the case. Frequently. Now, it doesn’t mean that this 30-year-old memory that I have seared in my mind is false. It’s just that I can’t be sure that this 30-year-old memory that is seared in my mind is true.
        
          When I was a young lawyer, I used to have this view of the law, so naïve, that was here’s one side that’s telling the truth, and here’s one side that’s telling a lie. And I always want to be on the side that’s telling the truth. What I began to see is on these really, really important things in peoples’ lives, I would see people believing with their whole heart that their story was right. And then sometimes reacting with extreme shock when confronted with contrary evidence.
        
          And so there’s actually a really interesting Malcolm Gladwell podcast recently, Revisionist History, that used the Brian Williams controversy to tee off on some of these aspects of our memories. And so that’s why when people say we need corroboration, we need corroboration, you’re not saying, “You liar.” You’re saying these things get hazy and our minds play tricks on us, and the more that we can have that can give us assurance that this 30-year-old memory is accurate, the better off we’ll be.
        
          Bazelon: Before we close, there’s an article in the New York Times by Richard Friedman, who is a psychiatrist, and he is pointing out in a way that I think has a very different emphasis than your rendition, David French: that when people experience intense emotion, that that can actually make memories more powerful and lasting. And one of the really important distinctions that Friedman is making here is between recovered memory, where a memory completely goes away and then supposedly returns—there’s a lot of reason to doubt situations like that—and a memory that’s there all along, that someone has tried to repress but can’t get rid of, which is very much what happened to Blasey Ford. It’s what happened to me. It’s what happened to Caitlin Flanagan. You can dismiss that as a few anecdotes if you want, but I think there are a lot of other people out there who have experienced sexual assault, a lot of women, who are in that category.
        
          And to me all of those things, not to mention the sort of culture of silence of the ’80s, weighs much more heavily than the kind of doubt that you are trying to sow here. Though I realize that for Republicans, it’s really useful to try to sow that kind of doubt right now.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-ed-whelan-conspiracy-theory-christine-blasey-ford-zillow.html,"
          On Thursday, conservative legal analyst Ed Whelan unleashed a disastrous Twitter thread seemingly designed to exonerate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of charges that he committed sexual assault as a teenager. Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, laid out a theory of mistaken identity using Google Maps and Zillow floor plans. The linchpin of Whelan’s thread: a notion that Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh’s accuser, confused the nominee with a classmate who looked somewhat similar. It was this man, Whelan asserted, not Kavanaugh, who may have attempted to rape Ford about 35 years ago. Ford responded with a statement saying that she knew both men in high school, socialized with the man whom Whelan named, and had not mistaken the two. Even before that point, Whelan’s conspiracy theory had unraveled, unleashing a torrent of Twitter mockery and exposing a longtime GOP operative for what he is: a bad-faith character assassin with no moral compass.
        
          But what’s most shocking about this thread, which Whelan has since deleted, is that Kavanaugh’s defenders appear to have genuinely believed that it would exculpate the nominee. Whelan is no random crank: He is a Federalist Society power broker who has played a major role in the selection of Donald Trump’s judicial nominees—including his good friend Kavanaugh. He and his allies teased out the mistaken-identity theory for days, hyping it on Twitter and apparently in a weirdly credulous Politico article. It appears, at the moment, to be the best defense the White House has. And that reveals that Kavanaugh’s nomination is in extremely serious trouble.
        
          Whelan launched his career by clerking for the late Justice Antonin Scalia from 1991 through 1992. During that term, Justice Anthony Kennedy famously flipped on two blockbuster cases involving abortion and school prayer, preserving progressive jurisprudence to Scalia’s fierce ire. Whelan found his clerkship demoralizing because of Kennedy’s swing to the left; he once told me of the devastation he felt over that “disaster for the Constitution.” Following a stint on the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and a detour into the lucrative world of corporate law, Whelan joined George W. Bush’s Office of Legal Counsel. There, he became friends with Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office and after that as staff secretary. Whelan personally emailed Kavanaugh in 2004 to tell him that he’d accepted a job as president of EPPC, a lavishly funded conservative evangelical think tank. (“Excellent,” Kavanaugh responded.) He also asked Kavanaugh to help him arrange a lunch with Karl Rove after he started his new gig.
        
          From his perch at EPPC, Whelan began writing influential posts for National Review, which he has continued to do. He has also reportedly coordinated with the White House—as well as Federalist Society chief Leonard Leo—over the selection and confirmation of judges. When Barack Obama took office, Whelan switched gears, ruthlessly attacking his nominees from all angles. He spearheaded the successful campaign against Goodwin Liu, whom Obama nominated to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, smearing him as an anti-white racist. (Liu is now a respected justice on the California Supreme Court.) He also helped to tank the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to the Office of Legal Counsel on account of Johnsen’s criticism of what she saw as the office’s enabling of the Bush administration’s excesses.
        
          During the Obama years, Whelan failed more often than he succeeded. He couldn’t keep Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan off of the Supreme Court, though he did leak a mean letter that Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe wrote to Obama critiquing Sotomayor. Oddly, he also disparaged Kagan for … not learning to drive until her late 20s. He also attempted (and failed) to force Judge Vaughn Walker to recuse himself from the litigation over Proposition 8 because he is gay and went on to claim that Walker used the case to “feather his nest” with “prospective San Francisco employers.” These examples neatly illustrate the Whelan style: petty, bad-faith, ad hominem attacks to serve all-out ideological warfare.
        
          And yet Whelan has long had a direct line to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republicans, according to sources familiar with the arrangement. He provides senators with questions and tactics to sink Democratic nominees and bolster Republican ones. Since Trump took office, per these sources, Whelan has worked closely with Leonard Leo and White House counsel Don McGahn to pick and push through judicial nominees. The Kavanaugh nomination was set to be the culmination of his career: Whelan himself was in a position to help select the justice who would undo Kennedy’s liberal legacy, vindicating Scalia at long last and reversing the catastrophe of that pivotal 1991­–92 term. And the man he pushed for the job was none other than his own close friend, and former colleague, Brett Kavanaugh.
        
          That nomination, though, has sputtered in the wake of Ford’s credible allegations. Whelan has at least been smart enough to recognize that his usual tactic of character assassination would not work on this particular victim of attempted rape.
        
          So instead, at some point over the past week, Whelan appears to have devised a bizarre theory of mistaken identity. On Monday, he vaguely floated the theory on Twitter. Then, on Tuesday morning, he tweeted a clip of GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch raising the prospect of mistaken identity. That evening, he was tweeting that he would soon put forth “compelling evidence” that would “show [Kavanaugh’s] categorical denial to be truthful. There will be no cloud over him.” Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, he added, “will soon be apologizing to Judge Kavanaugh.” Conservative commentators, particularly Erick Erickson, signal-boosted this buildup. On Wednesday, Whelan tweeted about a “horrific incident similar to the one the accuser alleges may well have occurred. But if so, she’s got the wrong guy. Kavanaugh wasn’t present, as this and much more will confirm.” Shortly thereafter, Hatch’s deputy chief of staff, Matt Whitlock, retweeted this tweet, adding, “Keep an eye on Ed’s tweets the next few days.” (Whitlock has since deleted his tweet.)
        
          Then, on Thursday, Whelan finally unspooled his thread. The backlash was swift and severe. CNN’s Jake Tapper described the tweets as “stunningly irresponsible.” Politico’s Ben White and the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman also gawked at the unforced error. The Washington Post’s Seung Min Kim, with Josh Dawey and Emma Brown, reported on Thursday night that “Republicans on Capitol Hill and White House officials immediately sought to distance themselves from Whelan’s claims and said they were not aware of his plans to identify the former classmate.”
        
          Garrett Ventry, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley’s communications adviser, tweeted that the committee “had no knowledge or involvement” in the tweetstorm. On Friday morning, Whelan told the Post that “I have not communicated at all with Donald McGahn or anyone at the White House, or Judge Kavanaugh, about the topic of the Twitter thread.” (He did not deny communicating with Judiciary Committee staff.) He also apologized on Twitter for naming the classmate—though notably not for claiming on spurious grounds that Ford had confused Kavanaugh with someone else.
        
          These claims are difficult to believe. As recently as Thursday morning, Politico’s Eliana Johnson reported that “three people who have spoke[n] to Whelan and Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo in recent days say they are ‘100 percent confident’ they’ve obtained information that will exonerate Kavanaugh.” It seems obvious that Leo and Whelan, at the very least, were working off the same playbook.
        
          Moreover, the claim that no other major players were involved runs counter to Kim’s reporting that “Kavanaugh and his allies have been privately discussing a defense that would not question whether an incident happened to Ford, but instead would raise doubts that the attacker was Kavanaugh.” They are difficult to square with Hatch’s introduction of the mistaken-identity theory earlier in the week. And, at bottom, they just don’t make sense. Whitlock, the Hatch aide who previously said we should “keep an eye on Ed’s tweets the next few days” with regard to the mistaken-identity claim, now insists that he was totally unaware of Whelan’s plans. Really? The Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republicans want us to believe that they were hyping a theory of which they had no prior knowledge. That’s quite a coincidence.
        
          It seems much more likely that Whelan had help in this apparent opposition research from those deeply involved in the confirmation fight—including those working closely with Kavanaugh and Hatch—and truly thought it would introduce sufficient doubt to secure the nominee’s confirmation. It is implausible that such a detailed conspiracy thread—with so many specific facts, so much purported evidence, and such advanced hype—was cooked up by Whelan alone.
        
          If the people who helped construct and hype this notion really thought it would work, then this nomination is in on the verge of collapse. Whelan’s theory is astonishingly desperate, an outlandish and potentially defamatory Hail Mary that no rational person would find persuasive. His willingness to humiliate himself and destroy his reputation in a calamitously misguided effort to push Kavanaugh over the finish line speaks volumes. Hard as it may be to believe, this is apparently the best they’ve got. Their last, best hope to contradict Christine Blasey Ford rests on cobbled-together Zillow pages, Google Maps, yearbook photos, and a Facebook comment.
        
          It is no surprise that Republican operatives who’ve conducted trench warfare against progressives for years would be willing to sink this low. But it is shocking to realize that the GOP has nothing else up its sleeve to save this nomination. There will be no miraculous exoneration of Brett Kavanaugh—just the frenzied tweets of panicked men who see their careful plans collapsing before their eyes.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/donald-trump-christine-blasey-ford-police-report-memory.html,"
          Donald Trump joined the chorus of Republican men implying that Christine Blasey Ford is a liar on Friday, tweeting that if her alleged sexual assault at the hands of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities”:
        
          I am shocked, shocked that none of Trump’s trusted and capable aides had thought to show him the research on responses to sexual trauma, which may help him understand why the 15-year-old Ford didn’t file a police report immediately after being assaulted. Less than a quarter of rapes and sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, making it the least-reported major crime. Research from the Department of Justice has shown that women refrain from reporting sex crimes to the police for a number of reasons: They don’t believe the police can do anything to help, they don’t want to risk retaliation (more than 70 percent of sexual assaults are committed by perpetrators the victim knows), they don’t want to get the perpetrator in trouble, or they consider sexual assault too “personal” to discuss.
        
          The way Ford has been treated by Kavanaugh partisans has, if anything, reinforced the dynamics that keep victims quiet. If she worried that a report to parents, peers, or law enforcement might not be taken seriously, she was right! If she assumed Kavanaugh’s friends and colleagues would argue what happened was just some silly high-school fun, that all boys do what he allegedly did, she was right! If she thought she’d be accused of lying, misremembering, tarnishing a good man’s name, engaging in immoral behavior, and being a slut, she was right!
        
          The suggestion that Ford may have mistaken Kavanaugh for a classmate who resembles him isn’t the most shameful insult to her character she’s endured in the past week, but it does reveal egregious, willful ignorance of the psychology of sexual violence. “Human memory is notoriously unreliable, especially over time,” Tucker Carlson said on his Fox News show this week. “Past a certain point, the past is unknowable.” But Ford isn’t trying for the first time to remember a night from 36 years ago—she has been thinking about it for 36 years. And experts say that while trauma and time can blur some incidental details of an assault, like the number of people in the room, the central components of an emotionally charged event—such as the identity of a perpetrator the victim knows, as is the case in Ford’s allegation—remain clear over time. Trauma suppresses the part of the brain responsible for translating observations and emotions into words. Ford may have been unwilling or unable to tell others about her alleged assault until a therapy session several years ago, but there’s no evidence to suggests she can’t remember what happened.

          On Thursday morning, a Politico reporter wrote that Ed Whelan and Leonard Leo—key figures in the circle of conservative Federalist Society activists who have guided the Trump administration’s judicial nominations—were on the verge of releasing information that would prove conclusively that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh did not sexually assault Christine Blasey Ford:
        
          The imminent release of the information was treated as a blockbuster event in right-wing circles. Conservatives “close to Kavanaugh” were “tantalized” by Whelan’s research, Politico wrote. A staffer for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, one of the senior Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, which is vetting Kavanaugh’s nomination, posted the following:
        
          Whelan was hyped as a source of nearly godlike intellect and authority:
        
          On Thursday night Whelan released his exoneration material, which turned out to be a wildly speculative case—made on the basis of Google Maps images, Zillow floorplans, and old yearbooks—that Ford may actually have been assaulted by a different student at Kavanaugh’s high school. Here’s an example of Whelan’s work:
        
          A bedroom and a bathroom on the same floor of the same house? What are the odds???
        
          Incredibly, Whelan—who is a lawyer!—went on to name and post a photo of the random Kavanaugh classmate who he’d just insinuated to have been the perpetrator of a sexual assault. The classmate, it turns out, is now a middle school teacher—and, according to a statement that Christine Blasey Ford made almost immediately to the Washington Post, she knew him when she was a teenager and is sure he is not the person who assaulted her. While it’s impossible to say a statement is libelous or defamatory in a legal sense without litigating the matter, Whelan’s tweets were at the least recklessly accusatory in the layperson’s sense of the term, and Republicans began backing away from him immediately. Here’s Orrin Hatch’s staffer:
        
          Here’s spokesman for the Republican-run Judiciary Committee, many of whose members have worked with Whelan in the past:
        
          The Washington Post reported that “White House officials” likewise “sought to distance themselves from Whelan’s claims and said they were not aware of his plans to identify the former classmate.” By Friday morning, Whelan himself had deleted his thread and apologized:
        
          Whelan has further asserted that he didn’t coordinate his work with White House Counsel (and judicial nominations guru) Don McGahn or Kavanaugh himself:
        
          This raises a big question, though: How, then, did Whelan come up with the idea to look up the plans for a house that Kavanaugh’s classmate lived in decades ago? Even if it were logistically possible, it doesn’t make sense to imagine that Whelan looked up housing information and yearbook photos for each of Kavanaugh’s male classmates before settling on the one he named; almost everyone Kavanaugh went to high school with, obviously, lived in a house that had a bedroom and a bathroom, and many of them probably vaguely resembled Kavanaugh.
        
          The Times’ Maggie Haberman, incidentally, says Kavanaugh “allies” have been floating a mistaken-identity theory “for days”:
        
          Haberman doesn’t say, however, that these allies were circulating the name of the specific classmate that Whelan outed.
        
          So, who tipped off Ed Whelan?

          Remember earlier in the week, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was suggesting that he took Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against Brett Kavanaugh seriously? How he wanted “to give the accuser an opportunity to be heard”? Well, he couldn’t maintain this façade for more than a few days before conceding publicly that he views the allegation as little more than a public relations blip that would be “plowed right through.”
        
          In a speech to the annual Values Voter Summit on Friday morning, where the pious assembly was piping mad about how an allegation of attempted rape was impeding its political goals, McConnell laid down a marker. “In the very near future, Judge Kavanaugh will be on the United States Supreme Court,” the majority leader said. “So, my friends, keep the faith. Don’t get rattled by all of this. We’re going to plow right through it and do our job.”
        
          “We’re going to have Judge Kavanaugh—Justice Kavanaugh,” he said toward the end of the speech, after boasting of how he compelled Democrats to accept tens of lower court judicial confirmations by threatening to keep them off the campaign trail. (That’s correct: McConnell admitted to these cynical political reasons for setting the Senate schedule the way he did, right there in the open.)
        
          McConnell doesn’t typically go out on a limb like this without knowing where the votes are. There is no hedging, no “we hope that” prefacing “in the very near future” here. But McConnell also knows that when he says something like this, political reporters will write analyses like, “McConnell doesn’t typically go out on a limb like this without knowing where the votes are.” He may want the impression to get out there that this thing is in the bag, perhaps because it would then give a certain accuser the impression that it’s not worth testifying.
        
          McConnell can’t know for certain that he’ll have the votes next week, since this is a developing story. More reporting about Kavanaugh’s history could come out. The president, dying to smear Ford, could tweet something ugly that forces Republicans to make further concessions to Ford’s team in the ongoing negotiations over when, and how, she might testify. (Oh look, that’s already happening.) It could be that two of the three most-watched senators—Sens. Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Lisa Murkowski—have made commitments to McConnell to support Kavanaugh if the process of offering her a chance to testify is obeyed. And those commitments could change if unforeseen developments compel them to.
        
          Since the day Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, it’s never been wise to bet against him.But don’t believe it’s over just because Mitch McConnell tells you so.

          President Trump has repeatedly defended Brett Kavanaugh’s character over the last week as his Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation came into question after he was accused of sexual assault. “He is such an outstanding man—very hard for me to imagine that anything happened,” Trump said Wednesday. His defense of the judge mostly revolved around praising Kavanaugh, and he resisted mentioning his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.
        
          But on Friday morning, Trump’s defenses shifted in tone. He directly questioned the actions of Ford and tweeted about her by name.
        
          It was the president’s first tweet directly referencing Ford and questioning the specific allegations, rather than simply defending Kavanaugh as a person. But Trump’s shift started the night before. Ahead of a rally in Las Vegas on Thursday night, Trump spoke briefly, if not with characteristic anger, about the accusations with Sean Hannity:
        
          Hannity then called Trump “very accommodating,” to which Trump agreed. “They’ve delayed it a week,” he said, “and they have to get on with it.” On Friday morning, Trump repeated his question about the FBI not being called three decades ago.
        
          Ford and Senate Democrats have called for an impartial FBI investigation of her allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s. Trump, who like Senate Republicans wants Kavanaugh to be confirmed before the midterm elections, told reporters on Wednesday that “the FBI really doesn’t do that,” even though the FBI would do so if it was ordered to by the president.
        
          As for Trump’s question to Hannity, many have commented on the many reasons why a teenage girl in the 1980s—or any survivor of serious trauma—would be afraid to come forward publicly with a sexual assault accusation. Ford remained quiet about the alleged assault, mentioning it only in couples’ therapy sessions in 2012 and 2013, where notes mark that she described a “rape attempt” by boys from the school who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.”
        
          She agreed to speak publicly with the Washington Post only after she became convinced she would be identified from a confidential letter she wrote to her legislator, and she agreed to testify as the conversation about her allegations became more heated. Since she came forward, some of Kavanaugh’s defenders have asserted that the assault she describes and that Kavanaugh denies would simply be horseplay among teenagers and not a real crime. And as harassers repeatedly published her address on social media, she and her family have received so many threats that they were forced to flee their home.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/amy-chua-advice-brett-kavanaugh-clerks-report.html,"
          The Guardian reported Thursday that a prominent professor at Yale Law School told a group of students last year that if they wanted to clerk for Brett Kavanaugh, they should consider their appearances, as it was “not an accident” that his female law clerks “looked like models.”
        
          The advice was handed out by Amy Chua, who is known at the Yale Law School for her ability to help students secure clerkships, including with Kavanaugh. Nothing in what she said indicated that Kavanaugh himself had ever specified that his female law clerks have a certain look. But it did raise questions about why Chua—and her husband, another prominent Yale Law professor—believed that physical attractiveness would be relevant for these high-profile clerkships.
        
          Chua is better known among the broader public as the controversial but bestselling “Tiger Mother.”  She has been a vocal supporter of Kavanaugh, whom her own daughter will clerk for and whom she called a “mentor to women.”
        
          The Guardian report said that Chua reportedly told female law students preparing for interviews with Kavanaugh that they ought to dress in a traditionally attractive, feminine way for the judge. Her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, handed the same advice out to a female student, telling her that Kavanaugh liked a “certain look.” One former student said Chua told her to send photos of what she planned to wear so Chua could give advice on the outfit, according to another report from HuffPost.
        
          According to the Guardian, in at least one instance, the advice deterred a student from pursuing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. A clerkship with the judge was known to be important, as Kavanaugh often vetted potential clerks to serve under Justice Anthony Kennedy.
        
          Chua and Rubenfeld were not known to hand out similar advice for other judges, the Guardian reported. But the advice still raised eyebrows, and Rubenfeld is currently under his own internal investigation by the university, which is looking into allegations of inappropriate conduct relating to female law students, though it’s unclear what the specific allegations are. Students have also raised concerns about Chua’s influence over the clerkship process, according to the Guardian.
        
          Kavanaugh’s confirmation, which once looked all but assured, has come into question after he was accused of sexual assaulting a fellow student when he was in high school in the 1980s. His accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is negotiating conditions to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans, who control the committee, are attempting to move quickly and ensure a vote happens before the midterms. Ford and Democrats in the Senate are attempting to resist the Republicans’ urgency and are calling for an impartial investigation of the allegations.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/chuck-grassley-brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-republicans.html,"
          Whether or not you believe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh committed a violent sexual assault in his high school days, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley wants you to know there is at least one unambiguous victim in this scenario: Chuck Grassley.
        
          In a series of letters he sent on Wednesday, the Republican senator from Iowa laid out all the ways he’s been slighted, ignored, and hassled since Christine Blasey Ford went public with her allegations against Kavanaugh. His generous offers of a public hearing for Ford have been rebuffed. His request for an original copy of Ford’s letter of allegations has gone unanswered. And Democrats neglected to mention the allegations until Ford herself came forward in the Washington Post, forcing Grassley to schedule an extremely tiresome fifth day of hearings. “I cannot overstate how disappointed I am in this decision,” he wrote in his letter to committee Democrats. The poor guy can’t catch a break!
        
          The thinly veiled frustration in Grassley’s letters befits a man whose only worry vis-à-vis confirming a Supreme Court justice with an alleged history of sexual violence is that he won’t be able to do it quickly enough. Grassley and his fellow Republican senators see the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh as nothing more than a politically motivated attack on a future Supreme Court justice. That limited scope of understanding of sexual violence may be why Grassley voted to impeach Bill Clinton on the grounds that the presidency “is preeminently a place of moral leadership” but found himself able to defend Donald Trump after the Access Hollywood video came out because “there’s only a few saints who have been president of the United States.”
        
          Grassley’s letters are the prose equivalent of a sulk and stamping feet. “Had Dr. Ford not made her allegations public via the Washington Post over the weekend, I still would not know her identity,” Grassley wrote to Feinstein. “It has caused me to have to reopen the hearings for the fifth day of testimony, when we easily could have—and should have—raised these issues before or during the first four days of the hearing.” It is remarkable to watch a man who has the power to control Senate proceedings claim procedural victimhood in the adjudication of a sexual assault allegation. Of the leak that made Ford’s then-anonymous allegations public, Grassley wrote to Senate Democrats, “This is but the latest—and most serious—of your side’s abuse of this confirmation process.” These Democrats aren’t just subjecting Grassley to inconvenience and delays. They’re perpetrating abuse.
        
          Grassley’s stance aligns with the worldview, widely held among conservatives, that men are the true victims of the #MeToo movement. They are held to ever-changing, increasingly stringent standards of behavior, forced to answer for acts they allegedly committed decades ago, and denied positions of power and financial gain. Women, meanwhile, must only endure a little horseplay, which their allies exaggerate and draw out to make Chuck Grassley’s life difficult. Truly, it’s just not fair.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/blasey-ford-willing-to-testify-next-week-about-kavanaugh-letter-says.html,"
          As of Thursday morning, attorneys representing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, had yet to respond to the Republican-run Senate Judiciary Committee’s offer to hear her testimony next Monday. With Ford apparently hesitant to abide by the GOP’s strategically hurried schedule for finishing Kavanaugh’s hearings, his confirmation was beginning to seem more likely. But Ford’s representatives now say that she is willing to testify soon, if not Monday, under certain conditions:
        
          The ball is now back in Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Chuck Grassley’s court; we’ll see if he and other Senate Republicans press forward with the seemingly nonsensical but politically expedient (for him) premise that the Ford hearing can happen Monday and only Monday. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who have the strongest personal/political interest in treating sexual assault accusations sympathetically, would seem most likely to push to accommodate Ford, with ostentatiously conscience-driven lame-duck Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake being a wild card.
        
          CNN, meanwhile, reports that Ford’s attorneys were until very recently scheduled to host a D.C. fundraiser for (Democratic) Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a data point that will surely encourage hardline Republicans to claim that Ford’s entire accusation should be dismissed as a partisan tactic.
        
          In other words, this ugly situation is probably going to get uglier!

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/trolls-are-still-sharing-christine-blasey-fords-address-on-twitter.html,"
          This article has been updated with a response from Twitter.
        
          Since Christine Blasey Ford came forward Sunday as the author of a letter alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago, the Palo Alto University professor’s life has been turned upside down. Beyond the international media attention and scrutiny by politicians trying to understand or explain away her account, Ford has fled her home, received death threats, and seen her email hacked, according to a letter her attorneys sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
        
          By Monday, Ford had been doxed, thanks in part to Twitter users who repeatedly posted her personal information, including her address and phone number, and encouraged others to harass Ford and protest outside her home. Though Twitter appears to have taken some action to suspend at least one of the accounts behind this effort, as of Thursday afternoon, Ford’s personal information can still be found on Twitter, including information with her work email address and office location. At least one of the accounts that posted her personal information and campaigned to harass her, evidenced by multiple screenshots and complaint tweets to the company’s support account, is still active. Her personal information is also still available in deleted tweets and a deleted Reddit post that are searchable in Google’s cache.
        
          The posting of someone’s personal information online in order to harass, harm, or intimidate is a time-tested tactic of online abuse, and it works. It’s been happening for well over a decade, which is why it’s so surprising that Twitter appears to struggle to protect obvious targets. Twitter did not immediately respond Thursday afternoon to the question of why Ford’s personal information appears to still be circulating on its platform.
        
          The phone number and home address that are still being tweeted are the same ones that were posted on 4chan and 8chan—two message boards inhabited by trolls—at the start of the week. I found them on Twitter within 15 minutes of searching. Combating decentralized harassment campaigns may be like playing whack-a-mole, but there is, in theory, one easy solution to the problem: Block any tweets containing the numbers and addresses of victims. Twitter hasn’t done that. Nor has the company’s blocking of specific accounts done the trick, either. One of the most animated trolls dedicated to posting Ford’s information was suspended for 12 hours starting Sunday, as HuffPost reports, but returned Monday to continue tweeting out the professor’s personal details, though the user appears to be suspended now.
        
          Twitter’s paltry actions are particularly vexing considering how predictable this mess is. The infamous neo-Nazi Andrew Auernheimer, known online as Weev, doxed tech blogger Kathy Sierra in 2007, posting her Social Security number and home address, and urged others to harass her, forcing her to flee her home. In 2013, the Washington Post published a story about a man who posted a sex ad online posing as his ex-wife that read, “Rape Me and My Daughters.” Fifty men reportedly showed up at their door. During the Gamergate controversy, multiple women were “swatted,” slang for when harassers who coordinate online place false calls to the police with the home address of their target or their target’s family, causing officers to arrive at their home armed, often in SWAT gear. Even law enforcement does it—as police in Berkeley, California, did in August when they posted the names and photos of more than a dozen anti-fascist counterprotesters and activists before any charges were formerly filed, making it easy for far-right trolls to find them or for their employers to learn of their arrest.*
        
          In this case, there’s even been some counterdoxing. After Ford’s information was shared, some of her supporters tried to dox one of the people who appears to have originally posted her personal information. Based on the photo and the name on the account in questions, Twitter users found someone with a similar photo and the same name who is the pastor of a small church in Philadelphia and appeared to be attempting to locate him, tweeting out photos of the church and his LinkedIn profile. I contacted the church to ask if its pastor is the same person who has been suspended from Twitter but have not heard back. But it does not appear that the counterdoxers attempted to verify his connection to Ford’s harassment before they began trying to find him.
        
          While men tied up in political dramas get doxed, too, the tactic is most notoriously, and it seems most frequently, used to silence and harass women, as it was during Gamergate. And the horror of it all—random people showing up at your home, attempting to purchase things in your name, trying to steal your identity, threatening to kill or rape you, calling your personal cellphone, and worse—has a chilling effect on victims who would like to find justice. When this is what you get, of course many of them would be hesitant to speak up. When personal information ripples through a mainstream platform like Twitter, it makes all of this harassment far, far easier. So far, Twitter hasn’t shown it’s very interested in stopping it.
        
          Update, 6:37 p.m.: Twitter says it has now taken down the tweets that Slate found this afternoon containing Ford’s home address but stressed that tweets with information on her office location and email are not a violation of the company’s policy, because that information is publicly available on her university’s website. Twitter said the company is proactively working to find tweets that may break its rules in the case of Ford but wouldn’t detail how or what it is doing to keep her personal information offline. A spokesperson added that the company takes the posting of personal information very seriously.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-fbi-hearing-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          As soon as Christine Blasey Ford came forward as the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when both were in high school, it felt like we were hurtling toward something women in this country have wanted for decades: a chance to fix what had gone so horribly wrong during the disastrous Anita Hill hearings of 1991. Statements from Senate Republicans—among them Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lindsey Graham—forced Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to grant Ford a public hearing. Grassley sent invitations to both parties involved, and we waited.
        
          Kavanaugh almost immediately expressed his willingness to participate, while also categorically denying that the event in question had ever happened. On Tuesday night, Ford’s lawyers released the letter they sent back to Grassley. It is neither a definitive acceptance or rejection of his invitation. Rather, it states that their client requests that, before she agrees to testify, her claims be investigated by the FBI. (This, as it happens, is the same move Sen. Dianne Feinstein requested last week before Ford stepped forward.) Republicans see this as nothing more than a stalling tactic. Graham tweeted on Wednesday that “an FBI investigation of a 36 year old allegation (without specific references to time or location) before Professor Ford will appear before the Judiciary Committee is not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections.” Grassley has essentially affirmed that view, giving Ford a take-it-or-leave-it deadline of 10 a.m. on Friday to decide if she wants to participate in the hearing.
        
          Given the stakes of this fight, it’s difficult to see these requests and counter-requests as anything but political maneuvering. But we should try to understand why Ford would want an independent investigation of her allegations—and what it means that it’s unlikely it will be granted.
        
          First, it’s worthwhile to look back at the specific failures of the Hill hearings. Writing in the New York Times on Tuesday, Hill herself dispensed advice on “How to Get the Kavanaugh Hearings Right”:
        
          Who might this neutral investigator be? An op-ed published in the Washington Post on Wednesday made the case that local law enforcement in Maryland, where the alleged attack occurred, ought to investigate the complaint. But given that any investigation would need to coordinate with the nomination process, and given the extremely high-profile nature of the task, it seems preferable to task the country’s top law enforcement agency with the job. Indeed, Hill’s own allegations were investigated by the FBI before she was called to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. President George H. W. Bush directed the bureau to carry out that investigation in 1991, and President Donald Trump would need to do the same now. Trump, it seems, will not be making that request.
        
          Speaking to reporters on Wednesday morning, the president justified the lack of an investigation by saying, “Well, it seems that the FBI doesn’t really do that. … They’ve investigated six times before, and it seems that they don’t do that.” We all know by this point that the president doesn’t know how the government works, so a reporter chimed in to note that the FBI could do it if the president directed it to, to which Trump replied that the senators are “doing a very good job.” Then, in a letter back to Ford’s lawyers that was released Wednesday morning, Grassley noted that the Senate has “no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence.” He followed that up with a letter to Democrats on the committee denying their request that the hearing be delayed until an independent investigation could be completed. Basically, this has turned into a game of sexual assault investigation hot potato, and given that the executive branch is currently led by a man who brags about assaulting women and the Senate is held by the party that’s enabled him, Ford’s request for an independent arbitrator will go unheeded.
        
          As others have noted, it is incredible that a woman alleging sexual assault in 2018 has to fight to match the consideration Anita Hill received in 1991. Rather than course-correct for those hearings, it seems increasingly likely that this case will lower the bar. At the same time, it’s understandable to be skeptical that an independent investigation is so essential. If Kavanaugh isn’t going to be held criminally liable for his alleged actions—and he shouldn’t be—why does the FBI have to be involved? Won’t we find out the same information in a public hearing? Indeed, wouldn’t an immediate public hearing be preferable if the ultimate decision in this matter will be made by the U.S. Senate?
        
          It is not, and the reason has nothing to do with politics. There’s a clear reason why Ford, who researches trauma as an academic, would hold on to her request for a neutral arbitrator. Survivors of sexual assault often experience trauma. As trauma therapist Betty Teng wrote in Slate in February, a traumatic experience can cause an unmooring from truth that requires substantial effort to rebuild. That is why we have the maxim “believe women,” which doesn’t mean we’re obligated to believe every single thing any woman says, but is instead a shorthand to remind us that vocalizing abuse is difficult and victims deserve to be heard when they do so.
        
          Ford is clearly in trauma. This is, Dahlia Lithwick noted earlier this week, a fact that helps contextualize her decision not to come forward immediately. When she did choose to disclose her identity, the account Ford gave to the Washington Post was consistent with what we understand about how people process trauma. In the letter requesting the FBI investigation, Ford’s lawyers reference their desire to protect her mental health, writing that Ford is being asked to “relive this harrowing and traumatic incident” and concluding by requesting a meeting so the involved parties can “discuss reasonable steps as to how Dr. Ford can cooperate while also taking care of her own health and security.”
        
          One of the challenges we’re all facing in the wake of #MeToo is how to balance the imperative to care for victims while still upholding our innocent-until-proven-guilty standard of criminal justice and our if-your-mother-says-she-loves-you-check-it-out standard of journalism. A commitment to fact-finding and verification is essential no matter how terrible the trauma—it is only by establishing a fair process for both the accuser and the accused that we can create a system that supports accusers and protects the rights of the accused. Our institutions, be they journalistic or jurisprudential ones, can’t be guided by the same principles that guide trauma therapists. They should, however, take our understanding of trauma into account. At the moment, they barely even attempt to do so.
        
          Christine Blasey Ford has spoken up against an extremely powerful man who is at the center of an intensely bitter political fight. She has asked that, before she is questioned on live television by senators with inherently political interests, she be afforded the opportunity to tell her story to a neutral body that can assess it outside such a circus. She is not asking to be believed on principle. She is asking for a fair shot at neutrality. That it won’t be granted should tell you everything you need to know about how far we still have to go when it comes to adjudicating cases of sexual violence.

          Christine Blasey Ford, through her attorneys, has suggested that the FBI should conduct an investigation into her allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh before she makes any kind of appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On Wednesday afternoon, Judiciary Committee Chairman and Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley argued in a public letter that the committee is solely responsible for investigating the allegations. Wrote Grassley: “I certainly understand and respect Dr. Ford’s desire for an investigation of her allegations. That is precisely what the Senate is doing.”
        
          On Wednesday night, the Judiciary Committee’s chief counsel for nominations—who served as a political staffer in the George W. Bush administration—tweeted this:
        
          According to Davis’ LinkedIn page, he “leads a team of attorneys that advises Chairman Chuck Grassley and other senators on presidential nominations and Senate confirmations of federal judge.”
        
          Indeed, why wouldn’t Ford or her attorneys trust this gentleman to fairly investigate her allegation, aside from him having announced its outcome in advance, in public?
        
          Update, 11:30 a.m.: Davis’ Twitter account, which was locked on Thursday morning, is back up. The tweets above have been deleted, with the following explanation:
        
          It’s not clear, of course, how the statement “We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh” left any room for interpretation, left-wing or otherwise, about Davis’ goal.

          Some arguments are such transparently bad-faith bullshit that the only rational response is to refuse to engage with them at all. So when Erin Elmore, Amy Kremer, and Laura Ingraham all floated the idea that it was suspicious that Christine Blasey Ford waited until Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court to come forward—and immediately, and predictably, got harassed out of her home to avoid the right wing’s internet monkeys—it fell to Trevor Noah to give them the answer that argument deserves: “Get the fuck out of here, man.”
        
          Noah’s full response to that particular line of inquiry is a little more generous, but it didn’t have to be:
        
          In the rest of the segment, Noah presents a cavalcade of bullshit from the usual suspects, all eager to discuss absolutely anything except the specific allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. For decades, the right wing has relied on America’s willingness to waste hours, days, or years treating any idea, no matter how nonsensical, as worthy of consideration and debate, as long as it came from someone with the right pedigree. Those days need to be over. Get the fuck out of here, man.

          In response to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans offered the California professor a slot to testify this coming Monday about the incident that took place when they were both teenagers. At first, this appeared to be a welcome inclusion of Ford’s experience into the public accounting of Kavanaugh’s confirmation, one that Republicans did not seem certain to allow at first, but the strategic ground quickly shifted leaving a cat’s cradle of motives, requirements, and ultimatums from all involved that has left Ford’s participation at the Monday hearing in doubt.
        
          As of Wednesday evening, here’s what the key players want and where they stand.
        
          After her public disclosure earlier this week, Ford has indicated, through her lawyer, that she is unwilling, or at least unlikely, to sit for a public or private hearing Monday. “Fairness and respect for her situation dictate that she should have time to deal with this,” Ford attorney Lisa Banks has repeated time and again this week across America’s airwaves. For Ford, that sense of fairness and respect requires a “full, nonpartisan investigation” before she goes before what is a political investigation at the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing. Ford’s lawyers have also said it’s not fair to simply have Ford and Kavanaugh testify devoid of all other evidence-gathering and witness testimony, as has been offered by the Republican leadership, because it sets up an explicit he said/she said scenerio.
        
          On Tuesday, Ford’s lawyers called for an FBI investigation into the alleged assault before proceeding, a demand that Senate Democrats have echoed, reframing FBI involvement as a “background check.” “The FBI reiterated Wednesday that it had included information about the allegations in Kavanaugh’s background file and that it is up to the White House to decide what to do with it,” the Washington Post reports. “A criminal inquiry is essentially out of the question, because what is alleged does not constitute a federal crime.”
        
          Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have resisted Democratic calls to delay Ford’s hearing, claiming it is simply an effort to put off the proceedings with the hope of somehow kicking the confirmation vote down the road until—whoops!—it manages to slip past the midterm election in November, when the composition of both chambers could conceivably change drastically. “Requiring an FBI investigation of a 36-year-old allegation (without specific references to time or location) before Professor Ford will appear before the Judiciary Committee is not about finding the truth, but delaying the process till after the midterm elections,” Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted Wednesday, as he pushed for a vote “as soon as possible.”
        
          Grassley also made a case for expediency that doubles as an attempted takedown of Democrats, arguing that he is adhering to a similar procedure undertaken before Anita Hill’s testimony during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing. “I am following the same timeline Chairman Biden did after Professor Hill’s allegations were made public,” Grassley wrote in a letter Wednesday. “It would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this Committee, and the American people to delay this hearing any further.”
        
          Meanwhile, despite a few kicks, the Republican center appears to be holding, and in a radio interview Wednesday, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who had been supportive of Ford testifying despite some early Republican misgivings about getting off track with their slam-dunk confirmation, said she thinks Ford now has an obligation to testify. “I think it’s not fair for Judge Kavanaugh for [Ford] not to come forward and testify,” Collins said . “First of all, there have already been six background checks of Judge Kavanaugh for the various positions that he has held. … Usually the FBI does not pursue allegations against a nominee that occurred when the nominee was a minor … It seems to me what we should be doing is bringing these two individuals before the committee. … If we need additional help from the FBI, then the committee can ask for it.”
        
          Collins’ comments show that Democratic pressure to move the meeting back to allow for a more full investigation does not seem to be affecting key Republican votes that would be needed to torpedo Kavanaugh’s ascendence to the court. And, as my colleague Jim Newell pointed out elsewhere on Slate today, “[a]ll of the prominent Republicans who objected to advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination without an additional public hearing—Collins, Murkowski, Flake, Corker—really want to support him. And they’ll give themselves the green light if Ford doesn’t appear on Monday.”
        
          As for President Donald Trump? He’s been uncharacteristically quiet in the face of challenges to his doing exactly what he wants, when he wants. Trump does appear to be warming up though. “Privately, Trump is being cautioned extensively to stay out of the fight over Kavanaugh, according to two White House advisers, and so far has tempered his language,” the Washington Post reports. “He has told advisers that he is skeptical of Ford’s account and the timing of the allegation, these advisers said.”

          Listen carefully enough from any point within the Beltway, and you’ll hear a faint smacking sound in the distance as Senate Republican staffers repeatedly exchange leaping high-fives. Their plan to pretend to vet Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is working.
        
          They said they looked forward to hearing her public testimony—they didn’t—and on a partisan basis determined a process: In one week, with prepared testimony due by Friday morning, with only two witnesses called, and without outside investigation of the allegations ahead of time. In other words, giving her a chance “to be heard” while keeping within the schedule and bounds of their political interests.
        
          The rushed timetable and omissions of additional witnesses and outside investigation were features, not bugs, of the GOP’s plan, which was to bait Ford’s lawyer and Democrats into yet another procedural outcry. It is not the first time Republicans have successfully used this tactic since Kavanaugh’s nomination. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley requested just enough of Kavanaugh’s records from his tenure in the Bush administration to argue that he was being “fair” but left out just enough to send Democrats crying foul on a monthslong paper chase that distracted from the main argument that Kavanaugh would be bad for everything that Democrats care about.
        
          Controversies over the scale of reviewable records or the parameters of the hearing are, as the Washington Post’s Paul Kane tweeted Tuesday night, “process traps.” The process complaints are legitimate enough that Democrats can’t not voice them, but they make little progress toward the ultimate goal of making it impossible for Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to support the nominee.
        
          And they do need to make it impossible for Collins, in particular, to support the nominee, because she really wants to. All of the prominent Republicans who objected to advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination without an additional public hearing—Collins, Murkowski, Flake, Corker—really want to support him. And they’ll give themselves the green light if Ford doesn’t appear on Monday.
        
          The thrust of the response I see from the left to these tweets is that these senators are assholes. Fair enough. It takes one letter from Ford’s lawyers asking, Sure, but can we take a little more time and collect more information? for Senate Republicans to drop the façade about how they want to get to the bottom of this and tell her to HURRY IT UP LADY, JESUS CHRIST. They have a SCHEDULE. And yet this is a position that’s unifying Republicans, from moderates to conservatives, Never Trumpers to Trumpers, Susan Collins to Mike Lee.
        
          Christine Blasey Ford can do whatever she wants and not have to feel like she’s “letting down” anyone. She had wanted her allegation kept confidential to avoid this exact spectacle, the one that’s uprooted her from her home due to threats to her life and safety. If she doesn’t want to participate in the incomplete process Republicans have offered to “adjudicate” her accusation, that’s her decision.
        
          But we’ll find out in the next couple of days whether all of these objections from Democrats and Ford’s lawyers have just been negotiating tactics and she will testify on Monday after all. At least from the perspective of blocking Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the Supreme Court, though, Democrats seem to have gotten so lost in the process objections—by design—that they’re missing the point: Republican leaders didn’t want Ford to testify in a public hearing in the first place, and they still don’t. Her credible testimony, with or without additional witnesses or background investigations, is the one and only fatal threat to Kavanaugh’s nomination. As one very prominent Republican said Wednesday morning, “if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we’ll have to make a decision.”
        
          Let them make a decision.

          Donald Trump Jr. is, unofficially, his father’s liaison to crude, internet-based “alt-right” Trump supporters. In this role, he made the following Instagram post about the letter that Christine Blasey Ford sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school:*
        
          Ha ha ha!
        
          One person who’s not amused is Republican Sen. Jeff Flake:
        
          Flake is still probably going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh if Ford doesn’t agree to the Republican-led Judiciary Committee’s request that she appear at a hastily scheduled hearing that won’t involve an impartial outside investigation into her allegation. So he is not necessarily taking the strongest position in defense of sexual assault victims here. But sometimes, here in Crazytown (gestures at all of America), it’s refreshing to hear someone speak the obvious truth.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/trump-kavanaugh-outstanding-man-good-man-list.html,"
          Donald Trump spoke briefly about the sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Wednesday morning at the White House, adopting the Republican Party line that Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is obliged to testify against him in public immediately:
        
          As an “outstanding man,” Kavanaugh joins a less-than-illustrious group of crime-doers, scam enthusiasts, and lecherous crank-yankers whom Trump has defended by declaring confidently that he knows them to be “fine” or “good” people.
        
          • Trump called his former personal attorney Michael Cohen “a fine person with a wonderful family”— adding that Cohen would never “flip” and testify against him—months before Cohen pleaded guilty to a number of fraud charges, including a campaign-finance violation he said Trump had ordered him to commit. Trump also called his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort “a brave man” with a “wonderful family” in an August tweet, which gloated that Manafort, despite being convicted of fraud, had not flipped and cooperated with prosecutors. (Manafort has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.) And Trump called former national security adviser Michael Flynn “a wonderful man” after Flynn was fired over a controversial conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. (Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the incident.)
        
          • Trump called Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Tom Marino “a fine man” in the same tweet that acknowledged Marino had withdrawn his candidacy to become the administration’s top drug-control official amid reporting about Marino’s sponsorship of a pharmaceutical industry–endorsed bill that relaxed restrictions on opioid sales. Trump also described former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, who spent more than $1 million of government funds on wildly unnecessary luxury airfare accommodations during his short Cabinet tenure, as a “very good man” an hour before Price resigned under pressure. And he called former EPA director Scott Pruitt “a good man” before Pruitt resigned for being the least ethical person to ever live on Earth.
        
          • Trump called Bill O’Reilly a “good person” who had not done “anything wrong” shortly before O’Reilly was forced out of his job at Fox News amid reports that the network had paid what turned out to be a staggering $45 million to settle six separate lawsuits against O’Reilly for sexual harassment and verbal abuse. Trump also called O’Reilly’s former boss Roger Ailes, who was the subject of similarly extensive allegations of being a relentless sex creep, a “very, very good person.”
        
          • Finally, of course, Trump said the participants in a Nazi-themed 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, included “some very fine people”—doing so after one of them ran over and killed an anti-racist counterprotester with a car. Trump relatedly called former White House adviser Steve Bannon “a good man” who is “not a racist,” the latter description being egregiously incorrect.
        
          Asserting subjectively that his allies are of fundamentally sound character, it seems, is Trump’s reflexive response when they’re accused of doing embezzlement/assault/ethnic cleansing/light treason. It’s an approach that appeals to the “one of us” tribal loyalty that he cultivates in his supporters—and it conveniently means he doesn’t have to bother learning or discussing the actual details of any given accusation, which is good for him because he doesn’t like to learn. It’s a win-win, except for taxpayers, nonwhite people, women, and the general concepts of accountability and decency!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-fbi-investigation-testify-kavanaugh-confirmation.html,"
          In the wake of her sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford looked set to take center stage and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a slot carved out Monday, but now the next step in the handling of her allegation is in flux and her appearance in doubt. On Tuesday, Ford’s lawyers sent Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa a letter expressing Ford’s desire to appear before the committee—but only after the FBI was given the opportunity to investigate the matter in order to “ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decision.”
        
          An investigation of this nature, quite clearly, couldn’t happen in less than a week. Ford’s expressed desire to have some established facts that, at the very least, allow for a common starting point, echoes calls of Senate Democrats and puts in relief the differing political strategies of the two parties. Democrats are looking to slow the process down and perhaps even run out the clock on the nomination until the midterms and Republicans are deploying their hurry up offense to try to get the confirmation in the books, preferably, for the GOP, with Ford being offered, but without actually testifying publicly. “If she does not come on Monday, we are going to move on and vote on Wednesday,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News Tuesday evening.
        
          “[Ford’s] public accusation led Grassley on Monday to announce that the committee would convene next Monday to give both Kavanaugh and Ford the opportunity to publicly testify, as both had indicated a willingness to do so,” CNN notes. “But as of Tuesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans had yet to hear from Ford or her lawyer regarding their request for her to testify.” Ford’s lawyer Lisa Page indicated to CNN’s Anderson Cooper Tuesday night that Ford was committed to engaging with the process, but on her own timetable. “It’s premature to talk about a hearing on Monday,” Page told Cooper. “People understand that. She has been dealing with the threats, the harassment, and the safety of her family. That’s what she’s been focused on for the last two days and will continue to be focused on that. So asking her to come forward in four or five days and sit before the Judiciary Committee on national TV is not a fair process. If they care about doing the right thing here and treating this seriously, as they have said, then they will do the right thing and they will properly investigate this. She will work with them in that investigation and also to share her story with the committee. However that happens.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-senate-republicans-democrats-no-christine-blasey-ford-hearing.html,"
          The most high-stakes Senate hearing of the year has been scheduled, but no one really wants to have it.
        
          Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that “we want to give the accuser,” Christine Blasey Ford, “an opportunity to be heard.” That’s supposedly why he and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley decided late Monday afternoon that they would hold a public hearing featuring testimony from both Ford and the man she said assaulted her in high school, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in a week.
        
          Rest assured, though, that McConnell does not want to “give the accuser an opportunity to be heard” out of any sense of moral responsibility. He’s doing it because he doesn’t have the votes otherwise. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake specifically told leadership that he would vote “no” in committee on Kavanaugh’s nomination without a public hearing. Even if McConnell chose to bypass the committee process, he would run into interference from other key senators, like Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Rarely is a surface-level moral posture from Mitch McConnell anything more than a reflection of a poor whip count.
        
          Most Republicans would have preferred not to have an open hearing, which is why Grassley tried earlier this week to satisfy senators by arranging private phone calls with Kavanaugh and Ford instead. There are a couple of obvious reasons why: In public, Ford could deliver credible testimony that would be covered widely, making the option of advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination even more politically toxic than it’s already become. And it wouldn’t help the all-male Republican membership of the Judiciary Committee to aggressively attack Ford’s credibility or character, either. (HuffPost reports that Republicans are considering having their female staff do the questioning, an unorthodox move that would just draw more attention to the problem.)
        
          You might think, then, that Senate Democrats would be pleased with how Flake, Collins, Murkowski, and others forced Grassley and McConnell’s hands into providing Ford the opportunity for a public hearing. Instead, at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Senate Democrats called the proposed hearing a “sham.”
        
          “Scheduling the hearing for Monday, a week from when Dr. Ford made her accusations public,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray said, “is a shameful attempt to jam this through without giving anyone the time they need to investigate and put together the questions that need to be asked.” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Judiciary Committee member, said that “Republican leadership has completely disrespected this survivor.”
        
          “This proceeding is more like something out of Russia than the United States of America,” Blumenthal, pressing his luck, declared.
        
          Democrats listed several conditions that Republicans would need to meet. They should first wait until the FBI completes a full investigation into the matter so that senators aren’t, as Blumenthal told me, just “shooting in the dark” during their questioning. Democrats are also apoplectic that Grassley has refused to call Mark Judge, the lone witness to the alleged assault Ford described in her letter and to the Washington Post, to testify. Judge has a rather unfortunate trail of writings.
        
          There are a few reasons why Democrats might be throwing cold water on the sort of hearing that Republicans have offered. The first is political: The longer this confirmation process can be delayed, the less likely Senate Republicans would be to confirm a replacement ahead of the midterms. Yes, Republicans could and likely would try to complete it during the lame-duck session, especially if Democrats take back the Senate. But Democrats have some hope—a hope I don’t put much faith in—that a couple of retiring or “Never Trump” Republicans might balk at such an aggressive power grab.
        
          But this isn’t all politics. For instance, there’s zero nonpolitical reason that an alleged eyewitness shouldn’t be heard. Judge’s lawyer sent a letter to Grassley on Tuesday afternoon saying that he did not “wish” to speak any further publicly, as if this committee should care about his wishes. But Grassley seems content to honor them. And it’s not unreasonable to think that having an outside investigation into the matter—“preparation,” the Democrats call it—ahead of the hearing is best for a fair outcome.
        
          The Democrats’ objections also serve as a pre-buttal—that this hearing was rigged against Ford from the start—in the event that Ford doesn’t appear. Because, as of Tuesday afternoon, Ford’s lawyers still hadn’t confirmed that she would attend next Monday’s spectacle and have offered sparse commentary on what’s the holdup.
        
          It could be that there’s a simple scheduling issue for either Ford or her legal team. As various Democrats noted in their press conference, Grassley didn’t ask Ford if she was free next Monday before making his announcement. Ford could also have cold feet. In either case, as California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday morning, “We don’t even know if Dr. Ford is able to make it.”
        
          The possibility that Ford might not appear put a bit of a spring in Republicans’ step by Tuesday afternoon. Grassley’s office sent out numerous statements about how eager it was to hold the hearing—if only Ford’s team would call back. Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s did the same. “So far, Dr. Ford’s lawyer has refused to respond to invitations to participate,” Cornyn said at a GOP press conference. “We certainly hope that she takes advantage of this opportunity if she still would like to.”
        
          Of course he doesn’t. Republicans would love nothing more than if Ford didn’t appear. They could still hold a hearing for Kavanaugh to deliver his denials while Democrats spin their wheels, and then vote on him in committee on Wednesday. Even Flake, who demanded the hearing, told CNN on Tuesday that he would support advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination if Ford didn’t show up. His colleagues agreed.
        
          “The committee should move on,” Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said, should Ford “have the opportunity to be heard, and not be heard.”
        
          “It would be viewed very negatively by many,” he continued, “for someone to be given an opportunity after making serious allegations and then not coming.” It’s clear that Republicans would treat that as an effective withdrawal of the allegations. This is the most obvious way Republicans would salvage Kavanaugh’s nomination, which they showed no signs of wanting to abandon on Tuesday.
        
          So each party does want a hearing after all. Republicans want one immediately where Ford doesn’t show up and Kavanaugh just denies everything. Democrats want one with Ford, but maybe in several weeks, months, or years down the road, following a complete outside investigation, and with a roster of witnesses, preferably once they control the Senate, or maybe never. Everyone’s on the same page, as usual.

          This time last week, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination was shaping up to be a small but significant factor in some of the most important Senate races of the year. But after Christine Blasey Ford went public over the weekend with her allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school, the nomination has taken center stage in the dozen or so races that are most likely to decide control of the Senate.
        
          The Democrats who have spoken out all agree: Ford deserves the chance to be heard and Kavanaugh the chance to defend himself. But while most of the Republicans are on board with the plan to have both testify next week before a Senate panel, the way each candidate has chosen to frame his or her response is telling.
        
          In Arizona, where Trump won narrowly two years ago, Republican Rep. Martha McSally called the hearing “a sensible way forward,” striking the same tone as her Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.
        
          In North Dakota, where Trump won in a landslide, the differences are far more stark: GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer said it is “hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations.” In contrast, his opponent, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, declared: “It takes courage for any woman to speak up about sexual assault, and we need to respect Prof. Ford by listening to her and hearing her story.”
        
          Meanwhile, a pair of other GOP hopefuls, both trailing badly in their races, used the opportunity to take a shot at Democrats in their states. In Minnesota, for instance, state Sen. Karin Housley said that every accuser “deserves to be heard,” and then quickly applied the logic to abuse allegations against U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, who is running for state attorney general. “There should be no difference in the standards we apply to allegations of abuse or harassment, regardless of party or politics,” said Housley, who is hoping to unseat Democratic Sen. Tina Smith. U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci took a similar tack in Ohio, where he took the opportunity to dredge up Sen. Sherrod Brown’s messy divorce proceedings from the 1980s. According to the Columbus Dispatch, Brown’s wife testified at the time that she felt physically threatened by her husband, although she has since dismissed that testimony as “angry words” made during “an unfriendly ordeal.”
        
          Still other Republicans accused red-state Democrats of playing politics, as U.S. Rep. Martha Blackburn did in Tennessee with her opponent, former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, who called for the Senate to investigate. “Chuck Schumer is telling the Democrats to delay while they attempt an 11th hour smear of Judge Kavanaugh, and Phil Bredesen is already doing what he’s told to do,” said Blackburn, who wanted the committee to still vote on Thursday.
        
          Here are the full statements from each candidate running in the 11 Senate races that the Cook Political Report sees as the most competitive. The statements began trickling out after the Washington Post published the details of Ford’s allegations on Sunday and continued after Senate Republicans delayed a planned Thursday committee vote in order to allow time for Monday’s scheduled hearing. Slate has reached out to the three candidates who have not yet commented publicly and will update accordingly.

          Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson: “I’m still waiting for a meeting with Judge Kavanaugh I’ve requested four times. I have a number of questions for him. Meantime, I agree there should be an investigation of the new allegations against him. I believe the people involved should appear before the Judiciary committee.”

          Republican businessman Mike Braun: “I support Senator Grassley’s decision to have these 11th hour allegations thoroughly reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and weighed against Judge Kavanaugh’s decades of public service, sterling record on the bench, outstanding personal reputation, and his unequivocal denial of the allegations.”

          GOP state Attorney General Josh Hawley: “I’m concerned that Senator Feinstein and the Democrats waited until the last hour to bring this 30-year old allegation to light. The Democrats have played politics with this entire process and were opposed to Brett Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. They don’t care about the truth. I believe allegations of sexual misconduct should never be disregarded. That’s why it’s important that both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh be heard immediately and under oath.”

          Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp: “This is a very serious allegation which should be thoroughly investigated, and it’s up to the Senate Judiciary Committee to do just that. Prof. Ford should be given an opportunity to testify before the Committee and she is willing to do so. Judge Kavanaugh has also expressed his willingness to discuss the issue with the Committee. It takes courage for any woman to speak up about sexual assault, and we need to respect Prof. Ford by listening to her and hearing her story.”
        
          GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer: “It is hard not to be skeptical considering the timing and history of the allegations. Of course any allegation of this nature should be taken seriously, but absent significant evidence being brought forth immediately, I feel Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation process should proceed.”

          Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin: “Professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name. Both have said they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and I hope they will be given the opportunity to do that as quickly as possible.”
        
          Republican state AG Patrick Morrisey: “I have full confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committee and President Trump’s team to handle these allegations in an appropriate and timely manner, allowing both sides to be heard. It is disappointing, however, that Senate Democrats held this information for weeks only to drop it on the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote. The allegations should absolutely be taken seriously, but Senate Democrats have done a disservice to the accused, the accuser, and the American people, by politically waiting until the 11th hour to bring forward these allegations.”
        
          Cook Political Report: Toss-upRealClearPolitics: Rosen +0.7 pointsFiveThirtyEight: Rosen 3 in 5
        
          Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen: “Dr. Ford’s account is credible, it should be taken seriously, and I agree with the bipartisan calls for an immediate and thorough investigation before moving forward. If Senator Heller still has ‘no reservations’ about confirming Judge Kavanaugh, he isn’t listening to Nevadans.”
        
          Republican Sen. Dean Heller: No public comment yet.
        
          Cook Political Report: Toss-upRealClearPolitics: Sinema +1.5 pointsFiveThirtyEight: Sinema 7 in 10

          Republican Rep. Martha McSally: “This is a very serious allegation. Senator Grassley said he’s reaching out to both parties for more information, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford have said they are willing to provide testimony on this matter. That is a sensible way forward.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-trauma-truth-brett-kavanaugh.html,"
          Christine Blasey Ford came forward this weekend as the author of a letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. According to the account she gave the Washington Post, she remembers being pushed into a bedroom, Kavanaugh covering her mouth, and loud music being played. She is also transparent about what she does not remember: the exact year, the reason why she was at that house party, who owned the house, or how she got there. This lack of detail, combined with the amount of time elapsed since the alleged assault, has caused some to question her story—how can she be so sure of what happened if she’s not sure what year it was? But given what we know about traumatic memories, the fact that Ford is hazy on some of the details actually increases the likelihood she is telling the truth.
        
          Traumatic memories are processed and stored differently than those of benign events. Asked to recall a significant life episode, most of us would tell a story: My wife woke up in labor, we drove to the hospital, and a few hours later my daughter was born. Memories of trauma, though, do not share this structure. Instead, they are collections of sensory impressions: the sound of a song, the smell of cologne, the pressure of someone’s hand on your mouth. This is precisely why trauma can be so difficult to treat: It’s not a matter of avoiding a person or a place but a feeling, an emotion. This is why many of my patients who are trauma survivors have constricted their lives to avoid the possibility of being triggered and have withdrawn from life as a result.
        
          We’ve been aware of this difference in memory storage and retention since Pierre Janet first began studying memory and trauma in the late 19th century, but recent gains in neuroscience have helped us get an even better sense of what exactly is going on. We can now look at the brains of people remembering trauma in real time to see which areas of the brain are activated and which are dormant. Flashbacks activate the amygdala, the part of the brain that monitors our surroundings for signs of danger and prepares us to take action, and repress Broca’s area, the part of our brain responsible for putting our thoughts and feelings into words. Trauma literally renders the brain speechless and fills the body with unspeakable terror.
        
          It’s no surprise that it took Ford years before she could put her experience into words. The fact that she disclosed her assault in a couples-counseling session is consistent with what I have witnessed in my own practice. The impact of traumatic incidents never goes away but can be buried very deeply until something triggers it to rise to the surface. This happens most often in our most intimate relationships. After Ford disclosed the incident in session, she told her husband the full story and processed the event with her individual therapist the following year.
        
          Some may find it unusual that Ford’s couples and individual therapists allowed the Washington Post to access her therapy notes. Such access could only be granted with Ford’s full approval, of course. When a patient enters my care, I am bound by strict confidentiality regarding their disclosures, but this is not a two-way street; the patient is not bound to keep anything we talk about secret. The information in the therapists’ notes is Ford’s to disclose if she wishes to do so. Medical notes don’t belong to providers but to their patients. Even though the vast majority of my patients will never review my documentation, I take care to write each word knowing that they could one day read them.
        
          If Ford were my patient and wanted me to disclose her records, I would want to begin by making sure she was absolutely certain about what she was doing. I would want to make sure that this was not a passing whim or something she hadn’t fully thought through yet (another reason why it actually makes more sense, not less, that Ford clearly weighed this decision for months before speaking on the record). If I felt comfortable, I would have her sign a release stating what she wished me to share and with whom, and I would encourage her to share the least amount of necessary information with the fewest possible parties. Within the notes themselves I would strongly encourage her to redact anything that is irrelevant to what she wishes to share with the public.
        
          Part of my interest in providing this advice would be to protect my patient. It’s disturbing that there are already voices asking why Ford didn’t come forward sooner and questioning the validity of her story. These reactions reveals exactly why Ford wished to remain anonymous. Traumatic memories are stored as piecemeal collections of sensory experiences and are often buried deep within our psyches. Ford deserves nothing but praise for coming forward, and everything we know about traumatic memory suggests she’s telling the truth.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-nomination-withdraw-necessary.html,"
          The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, faces uncertainty this week after more details were revealed about accusations of attempted rape that were made by a former high school acquaintance, Christine Blasey Ford.
        
          Ford is a California-based professor. She says that as a high school student in the suburbs of Washington in the early 1980s, she was forcibly restrained by Kavanaugh and a friend of his, Mark Judge, who is now a conservative writer. Ford claims they held her down, turned up music so that other people would not hear her resistance, and attempted to remove her clothes and assault her, although they did not succeed.
        
          In a special bonus episode of Slate’s Political Gabfest recorded on Monday, before it was announced Kavanaugh and Ford would be testifying next week, Emily Bazelon and David Plotz discuss the allegations facing Kavanaugh, what it might mean for the November midterm elections, and the future of the Supreme Court. Below you’ll find a transcript of their conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity. You can find Slate’s Political Gabfest via Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play, Stitcher, or wherever you listen.
        
          Emily Bazelon: The big thing that changed between last week and Sunday was that Ford came forward. Previously, the accusation had been anonymous. And when it was anonymous, it seemed impossible for the Judiciary Committee to act on it. I would agree that we can’t live in a world in which anonymous, unverified accusations derail anyone from anything. But now we know who this person is, we have the details she’s alleging, and the question is: What happens next? Do the Republicans ram through this confirmation vote this week, or do they try to get to the bottom of this accusation and find out how credible it is?
        
          David Plotz: Before we get into the fight that I expect you and I are about to have, let’s talk about what needs to happen. As currently constituted, the Judiciary Committee has more or less finished its hearing. They finished the hearings and scheduled a vote for Thursday, which would then advance Kavanaugh to the full Senate for confirmation, presuming he gets through the Judiciary Committee, which has an 11-to-10 Republican advantage. If one Republican senator decided not to go ahead with this vote or vote against it, or say we don’t want this vote yet, the committee might not be able to have its vote yet.
        
          And of course, there’s only a two senator advantage for the GOP in the full Senate, so if two senators decided they wouldn’t vote for Kavanaugh, that would imperil his nomination, assuming all Democrats went along with it. As we stand, Emily, it seems like a couple of Republican senators have expressed the desire to have hearings—that the vote should be delayed until we hear more from Ford and Kavanaugh. Is that right?
        
          Bazelon: I think so. I could be a little behind, but my sense was that Jeff Flake from Arizona, who is retiring, was the first person to come forward with a pretty strong statement about delaying the vote. Bob Corker, a little less strong, but said, Yeah, we should look into this. And then Lisa Murkowski from Alaska was the third person, with a much more equivocal statement by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina saying, If she wants to speak to us, I’ll listen to what she has to say. But by the way, here is the Republican official response about how suspicious the timing of her coming forward is.
        
          Plotz: And I think [Susan] Collins may have also expressed, in principle, a desire to hear more from her, as well as three of the Democrats who are most likely to vote for Kavanaugh—they have all said that they should hear from her. And even Kellyanne Conway at the White House has said she should be taken seriously and heard from, although what that actually means in practical terms, I don’t know.
        
          We could have a situation where she comes forth and testifies, and Kavanaugh and perhaps [the other man Ford other accused Mark] Judge come forth and testify about this, which would be a remarkable and unprecedented spectacle, and probably would have one person asserting one version of events and two people denying it, or asserting that they don’t remember it, or that she’s telling a falsehood.
        
          Bazelon: Right. And from the perspective of procedural fairness and truth seeking, isn’t that kind of testimony what we should hope would happen? I’m really not sure it’s going to happen, and I am worried about the spectacle of the Clarence Thomas hearings and the treatment of Anita Hill by the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. That’s the cloud hanging over this whole prospect. But just in terms of whether it’s fair to Kavanaugh to get to the bottom of these allegations, what do you think about the idea of Ford and Kavanaugh and Judge publicly testifying?
        
          Plotz: I am absolutely confused and muddled about this, Emily. I am really confused. Do you think that on its face, if this is true, that Kavanaugh is disqualified from being a Justice of the Supreme Court?
        
          Bazelon: If this is true—let’s be in the “if this is true universe.” If this is true, I don’t think that this allegation against him when he was 17 on its own is disqualifying. And the reason I say that is not to condone the behavior. If it’s true, it’s awful. But he was 17, and that means he was not legally an adult. Now, there are lots of states who, for the purposes of an attempted rape charge, would treat a 17-year-old as an adult. And [there’s] lots of irony, I guess, or hypocrisy about the notion of conservatives defending Kavanaugh, saying there’s no need to look into any of this, while very happily going along with sentencing lots of poor people, especially people of color, to prison on similar charges. So let’s just establish that that is problematic.
        
          But 17-year-olds, their brains are still developing. They’re, on average, not great at impulse control, and there are reasons to be concerned about holding people accountable forever for transgressions when they were teenagers. That said, I don’t think that’s why Kavanaugh’s nomination would go down. It would go down because if this is true, then he is lying or denying it, and not taking any sort of responsibility or having any recognition of the immorality and the wrong he did to someone here. And that seems to me the act of a 53-year-old, which we very much can hold him responsible for.
        
          Plotz: Right. I think I agree with everything you just said, unfortunately. It is certainly the case that a 17-year-old who acts in this way—it’s a disgusting way, it is deplorable, it is criminal. It’s a criminal act as described if he did this.
        
          Bazelon: Right. And if our sons did this, we would be really horrified. We don’t mean to condone this at all.
        
          Plotz: And also, I think your point that this is a kind of thing which, if you’re a poor black kid who gets caught doing something like this—especially to a white, teenage girl—you’re undoubtedly facing criminal charges, and they’re going to charge you as an adult, and everyone’s going to make a big deal about how you were 17, you ought to know better, you’re an adult. And the fact that Kavanaugh was rich, white, privileged undoubtedly means that he would have been treated more leniently had this been brought up at the time.
        
          Mark Judge has written about how much partying [he did], and how drunk he was, and his own drinking, so we should expect that he was a riotous teenager. It seems to me entirely possible that the events as described took place, and that they were part of a kind of a culture of drunkenness and fratty, dumb, boy school bad behavior.
        
          Bazelon: And does that make them better or worse?
        
          Plotz: No, of course it doesn’t make it—
        
          Bazelon: Or is it just irrelevant? The fact that he was underage is mitigating, right? He’s still culpable, but it makes him less culpable.
        
          Plotz: If there’s no pattern of him as an adult behaving this way, if he has been above-board and behaved honorably in all of his interactions with women, sexually and otherwise, since then, then we should count that very heavily in his favor, that it didn’t precede a lifetime of being a sexual assaulter and harasser and would-be rapist. But your point that if he doesn’t own up to it, if he doesn’t make any admission about it, it does suggest that he’s willing to lie and not bear more responsibility for his actions if this is true.
        
          Bazelon: And there’s a lot of victim-trashing that is going to be unleashed by that because his defenders have every incentive to go after this woman and call her a liar. It’s already starting. And so if this is true, he is responsible for all of that, and that’s disqualifying.
        
          Plotz: But this is not the same as what Clarence Thomas did. Clarence Thomas was an adult with a pattern of sexually harassing behavior towards women who worked for him as a man in his 40s, and I don’t think these are the same cases at all. It’s very clear to me that Thomas, under today’s circumstances, would not get confirmed, did not deserve to be confirmed, and should not be on the court for the reasons that we know now about, and we knew about then.
        
          Bazelon: Well, I’m not sure. It’s hard to redo the Thomas hearings because he denied it all. We have to say that. He said this was a “high-tech lynching.” He absolutely said Anita Hill was lying. And if the Republican senators voting on his nomination believed him, then he would have been confirmed. I think when we look back at the Thomas hearings—all the composition of the Senate Judiciary Committee is really different. There would not be this row of white men sitting in judgment of Anita Hill. There are four strong Democratic women on that committee. There are men who are feminists on that committee.
        
          Plotz:  Aren’t the Republicans basically just white guys? I’m not sure. There’s probably a woman among them.
        
          Bazelon: No, all the women are Democrats. I think this testimony of Ford’s, if it happens, is going to have some really ugly parts to it, but she would also have her defenders in the room, which Anita Hill didn’t have, [or not any defender] with a microphone in front of them.
        
          The other thing about Anita Hill, which has to be said, is there was another woman who had come forward with similar harassment allegations against Thomas who was never called as a witness. And there were also a couple of people who were what we call “contemporaneous witnesses”—people Hill had told about the harassment at the time. They were never called to back her up. And so Anita Hill stood there alone at a moment when actually there were other women who should have been called to stand in solidarity with her.
        
          We have no idea if there is anyone else out there who’s going to show up to back up Christine Ford, and obviously if he or she did, that would change the conversation. But you don’t have to have multiple accounts of assault to hold someone responsible, especially in a situation like this where, in our hypothetical universe where we think Kavanaugh did indeed do this, then he’s lying and he’s unleashed the powerful forces defending him against this victim.
        
          Plotz: I just want to point out that you and I have both staked a position, which is this is not disqualifying for Kavanaugh if he concedes it. But that’s slightly ridiculous for us to say that because if he concedes it, then he won’t be confirmed. Then people will say he’s a would-be rapist, and therefore, he can’t be confirmed. Can you imagine him admitting any of it, and then for Senate Republicans to come out and say we’re voting for him? They can’t. He has to deny it all, so we’ve set up an impossible situation where there’s nothing that he could do that could satisfy.
        
          Bazelon: Too bad. We should also say that it is different to get to ascend to the Supreme Court than it is to go to jail. We’re talking about an enormous honorific with a great deal of power versus criminal punishment. Too bad if he’s in a predicament. And I also think that the door is closed now because his denials have been so vehement and he’s clearly not going to back down, but there was a way forward and it had to do with Mark Judge’s account of high school, which was full of blackout episodes of being drunk. And so there was a world in which Kavanaugh, knowing in his heart that this happened or something like this happened, or very plausibly could have happened, could have said, “Look, I did stuff in high school I don’t remember, and I really hope I didn’t do this. But it’s possible.” That door closed sometime over the weekend. It’s not coming back.
        
          Plotz: Do you think we’re now going to have testimony where he’s going to have to talk about his high school drinking habits?
        
          Bazelon: Why shouldn’t he?
        
          Plotz: Is it going to get at that level?
        
          Bazelon: Look, either this testimony happens and there’s a full questioning, because the Democrats on the committee are going to ask questions of him and Judge to try to assess whether they’re telling the truth in the same way that people assess whether Ford is telling the truth. That happens and everybody testifies—that’s Door 1. Door 2 is President Trump withdraws his nomination because it’s hard to imagine those hearings playing out in a way that’s more favorable to Kavanaugh, and they just cut their losses and move on to the next nominee. Door 3 is that the Republicans just ram this vote through, but it does seem like there are enough senators who hold the key votes.
        
          Plotz: That sounds like you think there’s a reasonable possibility they pull the nomination?
        
          Bazelon: I do. Because when you start imagining this testimony and this hearing in this moment, it’s going to be a mess. It could be a mess for Kavanaugh, it could be a mess for Ford. Although to me she’s looking credible. And it could be a real mess for the Republican Party in November. Right? The political ramifications of going after this woman with—let’s imagine a moment in which she testifies, and she comes across as credible and sympathetic. What more do the women of America [need] to vote against Republicans in Congress than seeing that person raked over the coals for the sake of this nominee? They can find someone else to fill these shoes.
        
          Plotz: The politics of it is, for Republicans thinking about the midterms, it’s much better for them if Kavanaugh goes down than if he’s approved. If he’s approved, especially after allegations like this, Democrats will be absolutely exorcized. Any Democrat who had any ambiguity, especially any woman [who] was thinking of voting for Democrats, will have yet another reason, and Republicans won’t have that same reason to get out and vote for the court.
        
          If this nomination goes down and we’re in November without a full complement on the court, then I think there will be a lot of animated Republican voters who will come out and say, You know, I’ve got to get out and vote because even [though I’m] holding my nose around Trump, even holding my nose for the stupidity that this Republican Congress, it’s very important that we get the Supreme Court justice approved. And that’s going to be great news for Republican turnout, I would think. Having the nomination go down is probably their best hope.
        
          Bazelon: Fast, too. If you’re Mitch McConnell and you’re ruthless about this, politically speaking, you pull Kavanaugh right away, you pick someone else who hopefully has no skeleton in his or her closet, and then you get that nomination moving, but not all the way through by Nov. 4. And so if you absolutely need to confirm that person in a lame-duck session if Republicans lose control of the Senate, you could still do that, but you have it dangling out there for your voters.
        
          By the way, I do not think that Amy Coney Barrett, who is a lot of conservative Christians’ favorite choice, is easily confirmable. Someone in the Federalist Society told me this week that the second choice, the runner-up back when they chose Kavanaugh was Thomas Hardiman, who’s a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.
        
          Plotz: Before we leave, let’s talk about the credibility of Ford. She did not come forward with this allegation at the time it happened. She didn’t bring charges against Kavanaugh. She made no accusation against him. It first seems to have appeared in her life, or she seems to have been talking about it, in 2012. And she appears to have talked about it to a therapist.
        
          Bazelon: Yeah, and I think her husband was there because it was couples therapy.
        
          Plotz: [Her statements then] didn’t seem to have come with Kavanaugh’s name. But she has passed a lie detector test for what that’s worth, which I would say zero. And she has made what is clearly a very conscious decision to upend her life and expose herself to a significant amount of humiliation and attack. I think that actually weighs in her favor, the fact that she would be willing to expose herself after not being willing to. She said I’ll do this anonymously and then realized, You know what, I have a responsibility to be public about it because otherwise it won’t get a fair hearing. I think the fact that she, knowing what happened to Anita Hill, the fact that she was willing to be public about it is an enormous checkmark in her favor.
        
          Bazelon: I will just say it straight up. I had a lot of reasons to wonder about Kavanaugh’s nomination before this happened, and also reasons to err on the side of believing people who come forward in situations like this, so you can take everything that follows with that grain of salt.
        
          That said, to me there are some real reasons to think that this is a credible accusation, or reasons to discount the things that might push in the other direction. To me, it’s totally believable that a high school girl in the 1980s would not have talked to anyone or made an accusation like this about what had happened because of the shame and the fear that she would have felt. I’ve felt that from my own personal experience. I know that there are lots of women who went to high school in the 1980s and after who had bad things happen to them with boys, drunk boys, asshole boys, and didn’t tell anyone, and certainly didn’t think of this as something that you could go to the police about. So I feel supersympathetic to her about that.
        
          I also feel really sympathetic about why it took her a long time to decide that she could really come forward, because of the price that Anita Hill paid and that other women pay. Even in this moment of #MeToo when some men are toppling, it is a risky, risky thing to do. I’m sure Christine Blasey Ford has lots of other things that she’s done that she would like to be remembered for, and now her moment on the public stage is this one, and that is tough. That is a tough thing to decide to do.
        
          There are all kinds of disincentives for coming forward, so add that to her credibility. If other people come forward and there is proof that this didn’t happen, I’m open to that. I don’t think the case is closed, but I think it’s really important to think about the reasons why she didn’t tell anyone at the time, and the reasons why she hasn’t come forward until now.
        
          Plotz: Knowing the behavior that young men at private schools around Washington indulged in at that time, and knowing the culture of the time, I think it’s very credible. It sounds a lot like things that I saw or heard about happening among people I knew. And the idea that she wouldn’t mention it seems 100 percent congruent with what I would expect from a girl at that time. The culture was not welcoming to it. She wouldn’t have been taken too seriously, and it would have been dismissed as just “boys being boys,” and it would have been a “he said–she said” at best. There’s no reason to think she would have been able to come forward successfully and gotten anywhere, especially given that there was no—as she describes it, it wasn’t a rape. It was an attempted rape.
        
          Bazelon: Right, which meant that she didn’t have any physical evidence. As soon as it was over, she wouldn’t have had that.
        
          Plotz: It’s certainly the case if there’s some other story about some gross misbehavior relating to women that comes out about him, especially one where he’s an adult, I think that is unsurvivable. That is a problem.
        
          Bazelon: Yeah, but let’s not decide that we need a second accuser. Let’s not step that far.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/mark-judge-brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html,"
          The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold hearings starting Monday with Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school. Both Ford and Kavanaugh appear likely to testify, but they are not the only witnesses who should be called to the stand. As a number of legal pundits noted, there is a third person who must be questioned by the committee: Kavanaugh’s Georgetown Prep classmate, Mark Judge, who Ford said was allegedly involved in the attack.
        
          Ford says the two men trapped her in a bedroom during a party in Maryland in the early 1980s. She was around 15 and Kavanaugh, who was around 17, allegedly pinned her to a bed and tried to strip off her bathing suit, covering her mouth when she tried to scream for help. Eventually, Judge pounced on top of both of them, by Ford’s recollection, causing chaos that allowed her to escape. Both teenagers were “stumbling drunk,” according to Ford.
        
          When approached for an interview by the New Yorker on Friday, Judge said that he had “no recollection” of the incident. He then proclaimed Kavanaugh’s innocence in more detailed responses to the Weekly Standard and the New York Times later in the day, all of this occurring while the accusation was still anonymous. After Ford went on the record to the Washington Post on Sunday, Judge then reverted back to his initial statement that he didn’t remember the incident and asked to be left alone. “I repeat my earlier statement that I have no recollection of any of the events described in today’s Post article or attributed to [Ford’s] letter [detailing the accusation],” Judge told the Weekly Standard on Sunday. “Since I have nothing more to say I will not comment further on this matter. I hope you will respect my position and my privacy.”
        
          If the Judiciary Committee is going to conduct anything resembling a fair inquiry into the matter, it must call Judge to testify and subpoena him if necessary. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Tuesday that only Ford and Kavanaugh would be called to testify. But Judge is in a unique position to provide testimony on the incident in question, and he’s uniquely positioned to comment on the aftermath. In a written statement describing the alleged assault, Ford also wrote that she once saw Judge after the incident and “he was extremely uncomfortable seeing me.”
        
          In addition to these questions, Judge could expand on his own relationship with Kavanaugh—he could, for example, elucidate the plausibility of an episode in which both of them would have been “stumbling drunk” at such a party together. Kavanaugh, for his part, has categorically denied the incident and said that he wasn’t at the party in question, even though Ford herself has not offered a precise date or location.
        
          Why wouldn’t they call this witness to the stand? Republicans on the committee might be hesitating to call Judge because, based on his public writings, he would make a terrible character witness on behalf of Kavanaugh. That’s because Judge appears to be in a position to show that Kavanaugh’s high school days did involve heavy drinking.
        
          In 1997, Judge published a memoir about his own experience with alcoholism in high school, titled Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk. In that book, which makes frequent use of pseudonyms, he talked about an incident involving a figure named “Bart O’Kavanaugh” who “puked in someone’s car the other night” and “passed out on his way back from a party.” Judge also described a contest among his classmates that involved finishing 100 kegs prior to graduation. This appears to be a reference to real life: Kavanaugh’s own yearbook entry lists him as treasurer of “Keg City Club — 100 Kegs or Bust.” Judge’s yearbook page similarly made reference to “100 KEGS or Bust.” There are other clues about the two men’s friendship in the yearbook. Kavanaugh’s senior yearbook page has a line saying “Judge—Have You Boofed Yet?” and Judge has one saying “Bart, have you boofed yet?” (That same yearbook page for Judge includes the quote: “Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.”) Kavanaugh has discussed his college drinking days in the past with the Federalist Society.
        
          This is not to shame either man for drinking in high school, or in college. Rather, it is to acknowledge that there’s a swath of already-public evidence that seems to pertain directly to the incident at hand. The purpose of examining this history could help us gauge the consistency of both Judge and Kavanaugh’s testimony and weigh it against Ford’s. Both need to be asked under oath about their drinking together to see whether any inconsistencies emerge. For her part, Ford’s own lawyer has cited this behavior as relevant evidence. “My client had a beer. She was not stumbling drunk,” attorney Debra Katz told CBS on Monday. “The men were stumbling drunk, and one only needs to look at the writings of Mark Judge—who was the other person present—to know that he wrote about how stumbling drunk he and other members of Georgetown Prep were repeatedly, routinely.”
        
          There is other public writing from Judge that is potentially relevant to his testimony. It happens that Judge, who deleted his Twitter account after Ford came forward, is a published author who has written and tweeted extensively about sex, sexual assault, and masculinity. For example, according to archives of a blog post he wrote for GotNews.com, Judge was initially skeptical of the Rolling Stone sexual assault story at the University of Virginia, writing that it was unbelievable because the woman at the center of the case did not “scream” and that none of the made-up assailants had “had an attack of conscience.” Judge was proven correct about the report being untrue. This writing, though, indicates that Judge himself understands the necessity of hearing sworn testimony from the accuser and the accused.
        
          In a piece written for Acculturated in 2013, Judge seemed to approvingly cite the trope of shaming victims of sexual assault for how they dressed. Indeed, in responding to an essayist’s argument that feminist men ought to interpret a woman’s actions before pursuing them, he writes, “If a woman at her computer in Starbucks is, as Jarune [Uwujaren] argues, sending out several signals simply by the way she is sitting, then women who dress like prostitutes are also sending out signals.” (He acknowledges that the signal is “not that they should be raped.”) 
        
          Judge elaborated on his views in a 2015 post for Splice Today:
        
          Judge has also written homophobic comments suggesting gay people were “perverts” and has complained that they had overrun the now defunct political news site TBD.com. He once wrote a misogynistic column for the Daily Caller describing Barack Obama as the “first female president” and describing Michelle Obama as “actually more man than her husband.” In that story, Judge said he longed “for the days when president George W. Bush gave his wife Laura a loving but firm pat on the backside in public,” noting “the man knew who was boss.” On top of this, his deleted YouTube page, according to Splinter, featured “sexualized videos of young women.”
        
          Even beyond his writing, there is reason why Republicans eager to see Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court might be reluctant to use Judge as a witness. Judge’s own brother has in the past described him as an unreliable narrator. Responding to an article in the Washingtonian in 1997 that Judge wrote, which portrayed their father in a negative light, his brother Michael wrote to the Washingtonian: “Mark is a solipsist: spoiled as a child, gazing always inward, unable to recognize any pain but his own.”
        
          And finally, there is this story about Judge’s treatment of his colleague at Washington City Paper, where he occasionally contributed as a freelance writer. (Multiple other members of the City Paper described a similar account, which seemed to also line up with an episode Judge has written about himself.)
        
          None of this is to say that Kavanaugh ought to be held responsible for Judge’s past writings or social media postings; he should not be. But on Monday, the Senate will be tasked with figuring out what exactly happened in that bedroom all those years ago, and Mark Judge is a critical witness to call to the stand. His past public work is a relevant body that should be taken into account, as it speaks to his credibility as a witness in a sexual assault probe. The stakes of next week’s hearing—a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land—demand an effort to seek the truth not just from Ford and Kavanaugh, but from Judge as well.

SLATE,https://slate.com/culture/2018/09/brett-kavanaughs-accuser-support-julia-louis-dreyfus-high-school-alumnae.html,"
          Julia Louis-Dreyfus has added her voice to a letter drafted by alumnae from Christine Blasey Ford’s high school endorsing her choice to speak out against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford, who is now a professor in California, has alleged that Kavanaugh tried to sexually assault her while they were in high school.
        
          As of Monday morning, more than 200 women who attended Holton-Arms, a private girls school in Bethesda, Md., had signed the draft letter which reads, “We believe Dr. Blasey Ford and are grateful that she came forward to tell her story.” The letter notes that Ford’s story is “all too consistent with stories we heard and lived while attending Holton. Many of us are survivors ourselves,” and demands, “a thorough and independent investigation before the Senate can reasonably vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to a lifetime seat on the nation’s highest court.”
        
          Louis-Dreyfus broadcasted her participation in the effort on Monday with a tweet, writing, “I was class of ’79 and signed this letter.”
        
          As made public in an interview with the Washington Post on Sunday, Ford alleges that when she was 15 and Kavanuagh was 17 and they attended the same party, he shut her in a room, turned up loud music and covered her mouth to stifle her screams, and attempted to remove her clothes before she managed to escape.
        
          Citing these accusations, Democrats are demanding that Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee delay their vote on Kavanaugh which is still scheduled for Thursday. Kavanaugh has responded by calling the allegations “completely false,” and many Senate Republicans have maintained their support for the nominee.
        
          However, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine who is a key swing vote on the nomination stated on Monday that, “we need to know what happened,” and that she wanted to “have both individuals come before the Senate Judiciary Committee and testify under oath.”
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-senate-hearing-sexual-assault-allegation.html,"
          After Republicans tried to shoehorn a non-public investigation of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault accusation against Brett Kavanaugh before a vote scheduled for Thursday, multiple reports Monday indicated there will be a public hearing.
        
          Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told an NBC News reporter that the hearing is on.
        
          And GOP committee member Orrin Hatch also said as much to a Washington Post reporter:
        
          Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and President Trump stated earlier Monday they both are open to listening to Ford’s accusation, somehow. Grassley’s most recent statement said he was “working on a way to hear [Ford] out in an appropriate, precedented, and respectful manner.” He said he was working to arrange phone calls with Ford and Kavanaugh but that his counterpart on the committee, Dianne Feinstein, had so far “refused” to participate in them. Trump said at the White House that it was a “ridiculous question” to ask if Kavanaugh would withdraw himself from the nomination, but Trump said, “if it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay.”
        
          Kavanaugh signaled his cooperation to a hearing, according to a White House statement Monday afternoon: “Judge Kavanaugh looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation. He stands ready to testify tomorrow if the Senate is ready to hear him.” Ford, through her lawyer, also said she would be willing to speak before the Senate.
        
          While Grassley did not explicitly rule out new, public hearings, he has not mentioned them either. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican who is seen as a crucial vote for Kavanaugh, said she would like to see a hearing: “I believe in order for me to assess the credibility of these allegations that I want to have both individuals come before the Senate Judiciary Committee and testify under oath,” she told reporters Monday at the Capitol. “Obviously if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying.”

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-sexual-assault-accusation-sen-flake-says-accuser-must-be-heard-before-committee-vote.html,"
          Republican Sen. Jeff Flake suddenly put Brett Kavanagh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court in doubt Sunday, saying the woman who has publicly accused the judge of sexual assault must be heard first. “If they push forward without any attempt with hearing what she’s had to say, I’m not comfortable voting yes,” Flake told Politico. “We need to hear from her. And I don’t think I’m alone in this.”
        
          Flake, who is retiring this year, has frequently been at odds with fellow Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump. But his opinion on this is particularly important considering Flake is one of 11 Republicans on the 21-member Senate Judiciary Committee. “I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further,” Flake told the Washington Post.
        
          The senator spoke shortly after the Washington Post published an interview with Christine Blasey Ford, who came forward as the woman who had previously accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were both high school students in the early 1980s. Ford, a professor in California, said a “stumbling drunk” Kavanaugh forced himself on her, tried to remove her clothing, and prevented her from screaming. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford said. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.”
        
          Flake was not alone. Sen. Bob Corker also said the committee needs to hear from Ford. And while he isn’t a member of the committee, his support would be critical considering Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, also said he would be willing to hear from Ford, although he suggested it should be sooner rather than later. “If the committee is to hear from Ms. Ford, it should be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled,” he said.
        
          Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, are calling for a delay on the vote. The committee “must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,” Schumer said in a statement.
        
          Even as Democrats protest, Republican leaders in the Senate and the White House all seem determined to emphasize that they’re standing by Kavanaugh. One lawyer close to the administration even suggested there was a tone of defiance in their way of thinking. “No way, not even a hint of it,” the lawyer told Politico. “If anything, it’s the opposite. If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.”
        
          While the Republican leadership wants to insist the vote will go on as scheduled, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley was seeking more information and was “actively working to set up such follow-up calls with Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford” ahead of the vote, according to a statement.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-accuser-testify.html,"
          If the Senate Judiciary Committee votes on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday, as currently planned, it will send a clear message to the thousands of women who have spoken out about sexual misconduct in the #MeToo era: Your voices don’t matter.
        
          On Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford came forward as the woman who’s accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her in high school. Ford outlined the allegation in a letter to Rep. Anna G.Eshoo earlier this summer, requesting confidentiality. That letter soon made its way to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who failed to act upon it for reasons that remain hazy. When the New Yorker revealed disturbing details of the letter on Friday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley refused to reschedule Thursday’s vote. Sen. Orrin Hatch, senior member of the committee, agreed with Grassley’s decision. In a statement, he declared that while “every accuser deserves to be heard,” a “process of verification is also necessary”—and if the accuser remains anonymous, no such process can occur.
        
          Now that the accuser has gone on the record, we should take Hatch at his word. Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard. The Senate must pause the confirmation process and hold hearings—fair hearings that heed the lessons of the Anita Hill disaster, during which senators downplayed Hill’s alleged harassment and refused to hear from expert witnesses who could contextualize her experience. Hearings that are not rushed, that call corroborating witnesses, and that do not let Kavanaugh paint himself as the real victim. Hearings that will allow Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and other GOP moderates who have professed concern about rampant sexual abuse to listen to the victim and vote their consciences. A lifetime appointment to the highest court in the nation is on the line.
        
          The Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republicans issued a statement on Sunday complaining about “Democrats’ tactics and motives,” implicitly questioning Ford’s veracity. They appear predictably resistant to delaying the committee vote. It may thus fall on Collins and Murkowski to force their party to treat Ford with respect. No senator should be complicit in a scramble to the finish line in the face of such a serious allegation.
        
          Ford told the Post that she believes the incident occurred in the summer of 1982, when she was 15 and Kavanaugh was 17. She attended the all-girls Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland; he attended the nearby all-boys Georgetown Prep. She says that she and Kavanaugh were at a house party, and that Kavanaugh was extremely drunk. She alleges that when she went to the bathroom, Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, who was also intoxicated, pushed her into a bedroom and onto a bed. Loud music was playing.
        
          Kavanaugh then allegedly held Ford down “with the weight of his body and fumbled with her clothes.” He and Judge were laughing “maniacally.” When she tried to yell, Ford says, Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” Ford told the Post. She says Judge then jumped on top of them twice; the second time, she broke free and locked herself in the bathroom. Five to ten minutes later, she fled the house.
        
          According to the Post, Ford first spoke about the alleged attack early in her relationship with her husband, Russell Ford, whom she married in 2002, telling him she had been “a victim of physical abuse.” But she did not provide details of that abuse until 2012, when undergoing a couple’s therapy session. The therapist’s notes, which the Post reviewed, say Ford asserted she was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.” (The notes describe four assailants instead of two, which Ford believes was a mistake by the therapist.)
        
          Further notes from an individual therapy session in 2013 describe how Ford spoke of a “rape attempt” in her late teens. Russell Ford told the Post that his wife “recounted being trapped in a room with two drunken boys, one of whom pinned her to a bed, molested her and prevented her from screaming.” He remembered that his wife “used Kavanaugh’s last name and voiced concern that Kavanaugh—then a federal judge—might one day be nominated to the Supreme Court.” In early August, Ford took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent. According to the Post, the results found “that Ford was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate.”
        
          Quite understandably, Ford resisted taking her accusation public when Kavanaugh was first nominated. But she told the Post that now, “I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.”
        
          On Friday, Hatch complained that the allegations against Kavanaugh “are wholly unverifiable” and do not justify postponing Thursday’s committee vote, which would have sent the nomination to the full senate. That’s no longer true. These claims must be investigated; they cannot simply be waved away. Ford, now a research psychologist in northern California, has provided corroborating evidence. She has cast off her anonymity and allowed herself to become a target in an incredibly heated political battle. At a bare minimum, she deserves to tell her story to the Senate, to put forth evidence and testimony about the darkest moments of her life.
        
          Feinstein called for an FBI investigation shortly after the Post story published, and that, too, is necessary. But sexual assault claims—especially those that involve a decades-old incident—are notoriously difficult to prove. In the end, it may well fall upon each senator to assess the evidence and determine whether Kavanaugh deserves their advice and consent. The confirmation process is fundamentally political. Senators must exercise their best judgment based on the facts at hand, exasperatingly incomplete as they may be. The question is not whether Kavanaugh can be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. He will not be. The question is whether Ford’s accusations are sufficiently serious and plausible to thwart his rise to the Supreme Court.
        
          There is only one way to find out: The Senate must slam the brakes on Kavanaugh’s confirmation and hold hearings on this allegation. Senators must not manipulate the proceedings in Kavanaugh’s favor, as they did to prevent Anita Hill from fully corroborating her claims. They must listen to what Ford has to tell them—and the rest of us—and decide whether she or Kavanaugh deserves their trust. “Every accuser deserves to be heard,” Hatch wrote, before he knew the accuser’s name. He’s right. And now it is Christine Blasey Ford’s turn.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-written-answers.html,"
          Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh released his written responses to senators’ questions Wednesday night, and citizens hoping for any more clarity about his judicial views are in for a long, unsatisfying read. By Adobe Acrobat’s count, Kavanaugh used the exact phrase “Litigants in future cases are entitled to a fair and impartial judge who has an open mind and has not committed to rule on their cases in a particular way” 54 times, with “cannot provide my views” coming in a close second at 53, and “I do not recall” bringing up the rear, with 40 separate uses. There are also pretty clear differences in how he responds to Senators by party: Republican Jeff Flake asked a single question and got a two-page essay that begins “No one is above the law,” and ends “I have never and will never bow to public pressure … ” which he might as well have delivered Patton-style. Democrat Dianne Feinstein, on the other hand, gets a Nabokovian scavenger hunt, with answers like “Please see my response to question 18,” where question 18’s answer is “I discussed these issues at length in the hearing.” When you reassemble it, the non-answers to direct questions are striking. For example, here’s a very specific Feinstein question about Kavanaugh’s role in the investigation into Vince Foster, complete with a citation to jog his memory:
        
          And here’s Kavanaugh’s response to a yes or no question about whether he was present at a specific questioning session, once you track down his response to Question 49.a:
        
          It’s hard to write prose that is simultaneously comically suspicious and deathly boring, but Kavanaugh pulled it off. There’s also a cavalcade of low-end “literally true but misleading in context” non-answers like this one, which appears in various forms over and over again, and seems designed to leave the impression that Kavanaugh does not remember the specific events he’s being asked about without actually saying so:
        
          Then there’s this stock sentence, which is factually true but says literally nothing about Kavanaugh or his views, which he repeats whenever he is asked about LGBTQ issues, without saying whether or not he agrees with the sentiment:
        
          And then there’s his amazing recursive formulation when he’s asked about overturning precedents: each case is “a precedent of the Supreme Court entitled to the respect due under the law of precedent.” How much is that, exactly? But past all the toddler-level con artistry and insults to the readers’ intelligence, there is some new information here on three topics: his encounter at the hearings with Fred Guttenberg, his relationship with disgraced judge Alex Koszinski, and his high-flying finances, which included a credit card debt of between $60,000 and $200,000 that vanished entirely in a year. Here’s what he had to say.
        
          During the hearing, Kavanaugh refused to shake hands with Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was murdered in the Parkland mass shooting. He provided a detailed explanation of his actions:
        
          Kavanaugh also denied that he had asked that Guttenberg be removed, as Guttenberg claimed on CNN after the incident:
        
          As Dahlia Lithwick wrote, Kavanaugh’s knowledge of his former boss and close associate’s sexual misconduct—and how he reacted to it, if he was aware—would provide an important insight into how he might conduct himself on the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, he doesn’t remember. Asked by Senator Patrick Leahy to go through his emails and files and definitively say whether Kozinski sent him “inappropriate emails of a sexual nature,” Kavanaugh opted to rely on his memory instead:
        
          Kavanaugh elaborated a little more in response to a question from Senator Christopher Coons, saying he didn’t remember Kozinski ever “us[ing] demeaning language of a sexual nature,” but that he definitively “never saw him sexually harass a law clerk or candidate.” And he gave Senator Kamala Harris a flat “no” when asked if Kozinski had ever shared pornography with him. But don’t expect Kavanaugh to investigate the matter any further: Coons’ questions drew this hilariously non-responsive exchange:
        
          Ben Mathis-Lilley was unhappy senators didn’t ask Kavanaugh for more detail about his finances—he went from carrying between $60,000 and $200,000 on credit cards in 2016 to being debt-free except for his mortgage in 2017—and was interested in knowing more about an email in which he apologized for “growing aggressive after blowing a game of dice.” In response to a question from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Kavanaugh gave a two-page overview of his finances, the gist of which was that his debt came from home improvements and buying baseball tickets, and he was able to pay it off thanks to some combination of pay raises, his wife’s return to the workforce, and possibly financial gifts from family members, which are exempt from disclosure:
        
          As for gambling, Kavanaugh says he’s never had gambling debt or played fantasy sports, and by the way, did you know that houses require upkeep?
        
          As for the baseball tickets themselves, they were all above board and, like home repairs, very relatable, even to people who’ve never had between $60,000 and $200,000 in credit card debt:
        
          Kavanaugh also specified that the dice game in his email “was not a game with monetary stakes,” said he had never sought treatment for a gambling addiction, and, in response to very specific question about whether or not he had “accrued gambling debt in the State of New Jersey,” said he’d occasionally played low-stakes blackjack there in his twenties but never accrued gambling debt.
        
          Except for those three issues, Kavanaugh didn’t seem to provide substantive or significant answers for much of anything, besides referring senators to the texts of his past rulings. In a sense, it’s a great stylistic accomplishment: 263 pages of sound and fury signifying nothing, hold the sound, hold the fury. Happy reading!

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/susan-collins-complains-of-bribery-after-nonbillionaires-try-to-influence-her-kavanaugh-vote.html,"
          On Monday, Sen. Susan Collins accused political opponents of Judge Brett Kavanaugh of attempted “bribery.” The charge itself is without any legal merit whatsoever. That complaints about the campaign finance effort came from Collins, Republican election lawyer Cleta Mitchell, and an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell make the episode almost too rich to be believed. Their cries of bribery, illegality, and lack of principle lay bare the bankrupt campaign finance system that Mitchell and McConnell helped create and that Collins has contributed to with previous Supreme Court votes and will supersize with her likely vote to confirm Kavanaugh.
        
          Collins labeled as a “bribe” a fundraising plan by two progressive Maine groups, aided by the company Crowdpac, to raise funds for Collins’ eventual opponent in 2020. People are pledging to give money via Crowdpac to that unknown future opponent, but donors will only be charged for the donation if Collins votes “yes” on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. As of Tuesday night, the groups reported pledged donations of more than $1 million, with a $1.3 million goal. There were more than 39,000 individual pledges ranging from $1 to the maximum allowable donation to a candidate of $2,700.
        
          Now we can argue about whether the political threat to Collins funded by tens of thousands of small donations should be illegal. But claims by Mitchell and others that the fundraising effort is illegal are wrong, in part thanks to the deregulated campaign finance system that Mitchell and others have helped to create through litigation and a sympathetic Supreme Court.
        
          Mitchell pointed Newsmax to a federal bribery statute, Title 18, Section 201 of the U.S. Code, which makes it a crime when someone “directly or indirectly gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any public official … for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official.” Mitchell said: “These people have conspired to do just that—they are dangling a fairly substantial ‘thing of value’—namely, $1 million to be given or not given to Sen. Collins’ opponent, in exchange for her vote on a specific matter before the Congress.”
        
          But the Maine groups did not violate section 201. The groups are not promising anything of value to Collins to vote in a particular way; nor are they promising anything to Collins’ (now unknown) opponent for the opponent to vote in a certain way. This behavior does not come close to violating the federal bribery statute. And it’s not the first time Mitchell has made wholly unsubstantiated claims of campaign finance violations against political opponents.
        
          And what about reading this statute or other federal statutes to prevent what might look like extortion of Collins to vote in a particular way? Well, the Supreme Court has told us in cases like 2010’s Citizens United that large amounts of money sloshing around the system are just fine so long as they are not given by an individual directly to candidates. So long as there is no direct quid pro quo—dollars for political favors—all is fine.
        
          And the behavior of the two Maine progressive groups is not unusual, except for the fact that it is funded by small donors. This is demonstrated easily by looking at the behavior of those shouting bribery the loudest. As Adam Smith noted, although Sen. John Cornyn boosted Collins’ bribery complaints, back in January he was urging the Koch brothers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to reward the Republican Party for tax cuts benefiting wealthy donors. This came after big donors threatened to withhold money until Republicans got that tax bill passed. That’s closer to Mitchell’s claims of “bribery” than what the Maine groups are doing. Indeed, a 2014 report by Ohio State University law professor Dan Tokaji and then-fellow Renata Strause found that threats by super PACs to spend against incumbents if they don’t vote the way the super PAC donors want is an everyday Washington occurrence.*
        
          Perhaps the chutzpah award, though, should go to Sen. McConnell’s deputy chief of staff Don Stewart, who urged “every Maine Democrat … to refuse to accept this tainted funding” as the “principled” thing to do.
        
          Not only has McConnell been one of the most ardent opponents of campaign finance regulation, arguing that people should be able to give unlimited contributions directly to candidates as a matter of the First Amendment, he’s also been the key to keeping the Supreme Court in a position to strike down these laws with his blockade two years ago of Judge Merrick Garland. Garland would have been a key vote to uphold many campaign finance limits, had he been confirmed to the Supreme Court. Thanks to McConnell’s unprecedented obstruction, the judge didn’t even get a hearing.
        
          Now with the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch last year, and the likely confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh in the coming weeks thanks to Collins’ key vote, things are going to get much worse. As I explained recently in Slate, Judge Kavanaugh is a self-professed outlier when it comes to the First Amendment, agreeing with McConnell that there are constitutional problems with limiting the amount of money that candidates can directly accept.
        
          If the Maine story has a silver lining, it is this: So long as the Supreme Court is going to keep the money spigot open for wealthy donors, some of the rest of us appear to be at least trying to pool together resources to attempt to fight back. An arms race between the superrich and everyone else to try to influence legislative outcomes is far from ideal, but it is better than wholly ceding the ground to the plutocrats.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/facebook-fake-news-thinkprogress-weekly-standard.html,"
          In the wake of the 2016 election, to combat the rampant dissemination of disinformation, Facebook brought on five third-party fact-checkers to referee stories posted to the website. If any one fact-checker contests the accuracy of a story, it is flagged by Facebook as potential “false news,” and this “false rating” has a dire chilling effect on readership. This system thus gives a handful of outlets immense power over the articles that show up in your news feed.
        
          Four of Facebook’s chosen fact-checkers—the Associated Press, Factcheck.org, PolitiFact, and Snopes—are widely trusted and nonpartisan. The fifth, the Weekly Standard, has generally high-quality editorial content with a conservative ideological bent. This week, the Weekly Standard used its gatekeeping role in an incredibly troubling way, declaring that a story written by Ian Millhiser of ThinkProgress was false, essentially preventing Facebook users from accessing the article.
        
          ThinkProgress is as liberal as the Weekly Standard is conservative. I read and admire writers at both websites. (By way of disclosure, I am friends with both Millhiser and Rachael Larimore, a former Slate staffer who is now the Weekly Standard’s online managing editor.) But there’s no sound defense of the Weekly Standard’s effort to suppress Millhiser’s piece, which is titled “Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed.” In that story, Millhiser examined Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the Constitution’s protection of unenumerated rights, such as the right to procure an abortion. Millhiser concluded that Kavanaugh had signaled his hostility to Roe, which protects the right to abortion access.
        
          Millhiser’s reasoning is straightforward. During the hearings, Kavanaugh stated that “all roads lead to the Glucksberg test.” Under that test, only those constitutional rights that are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” are deemed to fall under the Constitution’s guarantee of liberty. Yet, as Kavanaugh himself noted in a 2017 speech, “even a first-year law student could tell you that the Glucksberg’s approach to unenumerated rights was not consistent with the approach of the abortion cases,” such as Roe. Moreover, the Supreme Court expressly disavowed the Glucksberg test in Obergefell v. Hodges, which invalidated same-sex marriage bans. Thus, it is fair to interpret Kavanaugh’s remarks as an endorsement of a judicial philosophy that requires the reversal of both Roe and Obergefell.
        
          My colleague Dahlia Lithwick and I made this exact point in an article published three days before Millhiser’s. But his piece boasted a more striking headline—that headline again: “Brett Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade last week and almost no one noticed”—which is apparently what triggered the Weekly Standard’s ire. The magazine has decided that the framing of the story is false because Kavanaugh did not explicitly state: “I am going to overturn Roe v. Wade.” As Larimore put it to me on Tuesday, “They change the headline, we change the rating.”
        
          Here’s the rather obvious problem with the Weekly Standard’s position: Millhiser is an opinion writer. He is also an attorney who clerked on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In his Kavanaugh article—as in most of his work—he is making an argument, attempting to persuade readers of his viewpoint. And in this case his views, as expressed in his headline, are perfectly defensible. Jamal Greene, a professor at Columbia Law School, and Jim Oleske, a professor at Lewis and Clark Law School, made nearly identical points. There is, no doubt, room for disagreement here. But this scholarly support does indicate that Millhiser’s assertion is, at a minimum, not “false news.”
        
          It’s easy to flip the tables on the Weekly Standard. Consider a March article with the headline “Actually, Palestinians Are Doing Pretty Well Under Israeli Rule.” Many Palestinians living in the occupied territories seem to disagree. Or this 2009 piece, which states that the “most profound aspect of marriage” is “protecting and controlling the sexuality of the child-bearing sex.” Is that a fact? The answer is surely that it depends on who you ask. And that is the point of the kind of journalism practiced by the Weekly Standard and ThinkProgress (and Slate for that matter): Writers express and defend their opinions, readers draw their own conclusions.
        
          Unfortunately, Facebook has now given the Weekly Standard what appears to be total veto power over ThinkProgress’ articles. According to a source who spoke to Quartz, Facebook selected the magazine as a fact-checker to “appease all sides”—that is, to convince conservatives that the social network isn’t beset by liberal bias. As a result, a Weekly Standard editor may compel a ThinkProgress writer to “change the headline” or risk losing Facebook traffic. Not because ThinkProgress was wrong, but because the Weekly Standard disagreed with its legal analysis. That is not fact-checking. It is censorship. Indeed, it is the kind of censorship that conservatives wrongly accuse Facebook of foisting upon right-wing outlets.
        
          Facebook launched fact-checking to screen out bona fide fake news—stories about the pope endorsing Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton having Parkinson’s disease. Millhiser’s story plainly falls outside this limited scope. The Weekly Standard may disagree with its headline, but it is simply wrong to call it “a verifiable lie” when it rests on a nuanced and subjective legal argument. It’s also galling that Facebook has refused to adjudicate this dispute, instead telling ThinkProgress that “Facebook defers to each independent fact-checker’s process and publishers are responsible for reaching out to the fact-checkers directly to request a correction.” By deferring to the Weekly Standard’s judgment, Facebook is picking sides in an ideological debate. That’s not just appeasement of conservatives, it’s complete surrender.
        
          I’m sure the Weekly Standard genuinely believes Millhiser’s article is misleading. The proper response, however, is to publish an article debunking it, not to quash it on social media. Millhiser’s headline is exaggerated, but captures the essence of Kavanaugh’s words—or at least, the author’s own informed interpretation of them. It’s a far cry from fake news. And Facebook should not let conservative editors police liberal outlets’ analysis under the guise of fact-checking.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/comprehensive-health-hawley-roe-wade-kavanaugh.html,"
          Brett Kavanaugh hasn’t even been confirmed to the Supreme Court, and lower-court judges have already declared war on Roe v. Wade. 
        
          On Monday morning, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an astonishing decision upholding a law that’s virtually identical to an anti-abortion measure the Supreme Court struck down in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The three-judge panel, composed entirely of Republican appointees (including a Trump judge), essentially defied the Supreme Court in allowing Missouri to saddle abortion clinics with pointless regulations designed to guarantee their closure. It’s a preview of how the courts will overturn Roe—swiftly, ruthlessly, and dishonestly—once Kavanaugh is confirmed.
        
          Monday’s ruling in Comprehensive Health v. Hawley was authored by Judge Bobby Shepherd, a George W. Bush appointee who has expressed hostility toward Roe before. In a 2015 ruling, Shepherd begrudgingly struck down North Dakota’s “fetal heartbeat” bill, which would’ve banned abortions after six weeks. In making that decision, though, he attacked the Supreme Court precedents he was forced to follow, urging SCOTUS to “reevaluate its jurisprudence” and overturn Roe. Shepherd’s bizarre opinion went on to cite pseudoscience about “the regrets of the women who abort” and the (nonexistent) “connection between abortion and breast cancer” while condemning nefarious abortion “mills.”
        
          Still, for all Shepherd’s anti-abortion rhetoric, he ultimately recognized that if he struck down the law he’d promptly get reversed by the Supreme Court. Three years later, this calculation has clearly changed. With Kavanaugh’s confirmation likely to go through this month, Shepherd no longer feels obliged to comply with Roe or its successor cases. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Whole Woman’s Health, the Supreme Court held that any law that imposes an “undue burden” on a woman’s access to abortion violates the U.S. Constitution. If a court determines that burdens of a certain restriction outweigh the benefits, it must strike down the law.
        
          The Missouri measure in question is nearly indistinguishable from the Texas law that SCOTUS invalidated in Whole Woman’s Health. It imposes two requirements on abortion clinics: They must meet complex, pricey, and medically unnecessary architectural standards; and their doctors must be “privileged to perform surgical procedures” at a hospital that’s no more than 15 minutes away than the clinic in question.
        
          This first regulation differs slightly from the Texas law in Whole Woman’s Health, because clinics can, in theory, obtain a waiver from individual “physical plant regulations.” The second regulation, however, is actually more severe than its Texas counterpart. That law forced abortion providers to have “admitting privileges” at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. The Missouri law, by contrast, forces providers to be allowed to perform surgery—a significantly more stringent standard—at a hospital much closer by.
        
          Recognizing these similarities, U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs blocked the Missouri law in 2017. Sachs said the state’s efforts to work around Whole Woman’s Health is akin to an attempt “to undermine Brown v. Board of Education” by insisting that “racial segregation in Missouri is more benign than elsewhere.” The Supreme Court, after all, found that Texas’ targeted restrictions were “useless, from a health standpoint” and addressed “no significant health-related problem,” while placing a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman’s choice.” Missouri had merely cribbed its laws from the Texas playbook, and so they must also be unconstitutional. The case, Sachs held, was “not a close one” in light of “the lesson” of Whole Woman’s Health.
        
          Shepherd saw things differently. He reversed Sachs’ preliminary injunction, suggesting that the district court judge relied upon “slight implication and vague conjecture” to justify freezing Missouri’s laws. Shepherd distinguished Missouri’s “physical plant regulations” from Texas’ by noting that Missouri clinics can hypothetically obtain waivers from specific design elements. The court, he wrote, could not strike down the law until it had more evidence of how generously the state grants these waivers. It is difficult to square this holding with the Supreme Court’s finding in Whole Woman’s Health that elaborate architectural requirements do not further women’s health.
        
          But Shepherd’s next conclusion was even more egregious. It would be impossible to uphold Missouri’s surgical privileges mandate under a fair reading of Whole Woman’s Health, which emphatically rejected the notion that such rules benefit women. So Shepherd willfully misread the ruling. The Supreme Court, he wrote, “did not find, as a matter of law, that abortion was inherently safe or that provisions similar to the laws it considered would never be constitutional.” Yes, the court found that abortion was extremely safe in Texas—but “no such determination about abortion in Missouri was made here.”
        
          This passage constitutes open defiance of the Supreme Court dressed up in the thin pretext of legalese. No one seriously asserts that abortion is currently more dangerous in Missouri than it is in Texas. And the Supreme Court did not purport to limit its analysis to Texas in Whole Woman’s Health; to the contrary, it noted that similar admitting privileges laws in Wisconsin and Alabama had been struck down as unnecessary for women’s health. That analysis plainly compels the invalidation of Missouri’s surgical privileges law—which, again, is even more draconian than Texas’ analogue. Yet Shepherd refused to block it, dishonestly speculating that Missouri could be “responding to … a unique problem” with abortion in the state. No such problem exists. This claim is mere pretext to ignore Whole Woman’s Health.
        
          There’s no mystery why Shepherd chose this moment to flout the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence. So long as Justice Anthony Kennedy sat on the court, laws like Missouri’s were likely to get struck down at SCOTUS. But as soon as Kennedy retired, Roe’s demise was all but guaranteed. His probable successor, Brett Kavanaugh, has a strong anti-abortion record, and emitted anti-choice dog whistles throughout his confirmation hearings. Once he joins the bench, the court will begin upholding anti-abortion laws—starting, perhaps, with Missouri’s—by defining an “undue burden” downward. And after it has eroded that standard to the point of meaningless, it will overturn Roe altogether.
        
          That’s why judges like Shepherd have been emboldened this summer. He isn’t the first to cheer on Roe’s downfall. In July, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge James Ho, a Trump appointee, bemoaned the “moral tragedy of abortion” and implied that Roe is illegitimate. In August, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Joel Fredrick Dubina, a George H.W. Bush appointee, declared that the right to abortion “has no basis in the Constitution.”
        
          These judges see what’s on the horizon. They have been waiting for this moment for their entire careers, and they will do everything they can to hasten its arrival. It is quite obvious to everyone not named Susan Collins that Kavanaugh’s confirmation will spell the end of Roe. Anyone who doubts that fact should look to the lower courts, where abortion foes are eagerly laying the groundwork for our imminent post-Roe reality.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/how-brett-kavanaughs-confirmation-allows-corker-flake-and-sasse-to-constrain-trump.html,"
          The word unprecedented applies to so many aspects of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. From the threat his confirmation poses to many of the rights we hold dear, to the withholding of thousands of documents from the public on spurious grounds, to Kavanaugh’s persistent dissembling before the Senate Judiciary Committee—the list seems endless.
        
          Democrats are fighting to expose Kavanaugh’s extreme right-wing ideology and the deeply flawed process by which his nomination is being hurried through the Senate. But the inside game effectively has an audience of two. Unless Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski are moved by Kavanaugh’s apparent perjury and the near guarantee that Kavanaugh will provide the deciding vote to end a woman’s right to choose, we are almost certain to see Kavanaugh elevated to the high court.
        
          While last week’s hearings proved rougher sledding than expected for Kavanaugh, we must prepare for the prospect of Judge Kavanaugh becoming Justice Kavanaugh. That is where another unprecedented element of this nomination comes into play. This will be the first time in American history that a president who many have described as an “unindicted conspirator” in high crimes and misdemeanors has had the chance to hand-pick a vote on the Supreme Court, including in matters that involve him.
        
          And that is where the audience of GOP senators who might break ranks expands beyond just Collins and Murkowski. Sens. Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, and Ben Sasse have all taken President Trump to task for his worst impulses and acts. They seem to see the existential threats he poses. They have consistently pinpointed those in public statements and speeches. Given the revelations from the White House this past week about the president’s dangerous lack of comprehension or control, and his material threats to the rule of law that each senator has condemned in public, the time has come for them to take at least some concrete steps to protect the country.
        
          Corker, Flake, and Sasse could impose a single simple condition on Kavanaugh: They can insist that he recuse himself from any case involving the special counsel, subpoenas and/or depositions of executive-branch members, pardons of Trump’s co-conspirators and himself, or a unitary executive’s powers.
        
          All three senators have made clear this week that they admire and support his nominee for his temperament and record. In ordinary times, that would be the end of the matter. But if these three senators believe the current president must be constrained and checked in his aspirations for absolute executive power, they hold in their hands the power to check him. This would not require voting against Judge Kavanaugh. But it would demand that they attempt to use their votes to cabin Trump’s lawless impulses. Democrats alone cannot force that to happen. Any two Republican senators can.
        
          As Sasse noted frequently during the hearings, Congress is not doing the job it was tasked with by the Framers. In lieu of Congress providing real checks and balances, any sober observer—including Corker, Flake, and Sasse—must see that the courts are the most significant remaining bulwark standing between us and autocracy. And the president is poised to put the fifth and deciding vote on several matters of enormous national import onto the Supreme Court.
        
          Judge Kavanaugh has expressed more extreme views of presidential power than any Supreme Court nominee in our history. Through his long career, his writings and speeches have shown that he does not believe the president can be forced to comply with a subpoena. He does not believe the president can be subjected to criminal or civil proceedings while in office. And he is among the most extreme proponents of the “unitary executive”—the theory that the president has total power to control the entire executive branch, which would include his ability to fire his prosecutors, obstruct justice, and more—on any level of the federal bench. Kavanaugh has said nothing in this week’s hearings to suggest that he is aware of the president’s boundless view of his own power; indeed the nominee has declined to even discuss this president’s claims about his executive authority.
        
          It is folly to believe that the judge’s extreme executive-power beliefs were lost on the president when Kavanaugh—who was not even under consideration for the seat filled by Justice Gorsuch—was anointed as the nominee. The president, after all, is now subject to multiple criminal investigations and civil lawsuits. It is hardly unimaginable that Donald Trump believed he could protect himself by nominating a justice who believes in extraordinarily broad presidential power. Nor does one have to reach far to imagine these issues being discussed privately with Judge Kavanaugh before he was selected. While he declined to discuss it in his hearings, one of his close friends works for the law firm that once represented Trump on these issues.
        
          Under these circumstances, should Kavanaugh be confirmed, and should he participate in cases involving this president’s power to protect himself from legal investigation, we don’t just risk delegitimizing the Supreme Court. We risk delegitimizing our entire democracy. The Senate is poised to confirm the person who will decide, in the foreseeable future, whether this president is above the law. The nominee refuses to discuss this possibility, and that is his prerogative. But senators are not required by any ethical rules to pretend that this scenario may not ever happen. They are, in fact, obligated by their oaths of office to at least imagine that it will.
        
          This week, Judge Kavanaugh refused to discuss whether he would recuse himself from any such cases and to explain what his standards for his own recusal would be, claiming, “If I committed to deciding a particular case, which includes committing to whether I would participate in a particular case, all I would be doing is demonstrating that I don’t have the independence of the judiciary.” So not only is he refusing to discuss his own conflicts of interest around the president, he is also declining to commit to avoiding them. That is his prerogative. But senators certainly can wield their own considerable clout to seek answers as to whether the president’s claimed immunity from any investigation, or suit, or any legal consequences—claims Trump proffers regularly—will be decided by a justice who has already made clear in his writings and speeches that at least in principle he supports such claims.
        
          This is a low bar. GOP senators should exercise their substantial oversight powers far more than the Senate is currently doing. They should investigate and expose the president’s ties to Russia. They should protect the Mueller investigation (as several Republican senators have suggested). They should work to ensure that elections remain free and fair. They should have insisted on delaying the Kavanaugh hearing until his full record had been released and examined. They should stop the Kavanaugh nomination entirely. And they really should caucus with the Democrats to ensure all of the above actually happens. For now at least, instead, none of that is going to happen.
        
          But, Corker, Flake, and Sasse have spoken forcefully on behalf of checks and balances, on behalf of constitutionally constraining institutions and the rule of law. So far, their criticism of the president has been eloquent and passionate, but it has effectuated exactly no meaningful change. To the contrary, when Trump’s attacks on the law and on his own Justice Department lead solely to sound and fury followed by inaction, it seems to embolden this president to further lawlessness. These senators have within their power the chance to protect the Senate and the Supreme Court from a president who has shown contempt for both. Demanding Kavanaugh’s recusal on matters involving this president personally is the tiniest of steps they could take toward protecting our democracy while keeping faith with President Trump and their Republican brethren.
        "
SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-outside-witnesses.html,"
          On Day 1 of Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, we learned that a liberal lawyer who stands to benefit from his rulings thinks he’s a swell guy. On Day 2 and Day 3, we learned nothing about his legal views, and lots about how frustrated Democrats are that Republicans concealed his paper trail. (Their anger is warranted, but politically irrelevant.) And on Friday’s Day 4, we watched a series of people testify about Kavanaugh’s impact, concrete and hypothetical, on their lives. Their testimony fits into two buckets: “Brett Kavanaugh is nice” and “Brett Kavanaugh is going to ruin my life.”
        
          Because the nominee himself was not in the room for these statements—and because most senators skipped them—you might expect Friday’s session to have been less tense, awkward, and painful than the events that preceded it. Instead, it was unrelentingly excruciating. The “outside witnesses” who testified on Kavanaugh’s behalf came across as insensitive and clueless. Those who testified against the nominee shared agonizing stories that illustrated how his rulings could degrade and destroy their well-being. The result was a surreal spectacle that revealed just how oblivious Kavanaugh’s supporters are to the consequences of his jurisprudence.
        
          Consider the stark pairing of Rochelle Garza and Louisa Garry, both of whom told stories involving Kavanaugh and children. Garza represented “Jane Doe,” an undocumented 17-year-old, as she attempted to obtain an abortion while living in a federally funded shelter. When the Trump administration prohibited Doe from terminating her pregnancy, Garza sued on her behalf, and a federal judge ruled in her favor.
        
          Kavanaugh reversed that decision, allowing the government to force her to continue carrying her unwanted pregnancy. As Garza put it, “the pain that this caused [Doe] is impossible to describe. I saw her suffer. No politician or judge saw firsthand what she went through.” Thanks to Kavanaugh’s vote, the shelter kept Jane locked up “under constant surveillance,” unable even to leave the building for exercise. She was only allowed to get an abortion after the full court overturned Kavanaugh’s decision, spurring the judge to write a furious dissent accusing his colleagues of permitting “abortion on demand.”
        
          When Garza finished, Garry—a teacher at Friends Academy in Locust Valley, New York—talked about how much fun she had hanging out with Kavanaugh throughout their “enduring friendship.” Garry explained that “we often talk about the benefits of youth sports in raising strong independent girls and women with confident voices.” Sometimes they have these discussions while going on runs. Also, the two “watch a lot of sports” together. On that basis, Garry urged the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh.
        
          Next, Elizabeth Weintraub, a senior advocate at the Association of University Centers on Disabilities, spoke against the nominee. Weintraub has cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, and condemned Kavanaugh for writing an opinion that allowed the government to make medical decisions for mentally disabled patients without their consent. “Judge Kavanaugh’s decision did not respect people’s rights and their freedom of choice,” Weintraub said. “Self-determination is a basic human right for all people with all disability. People with intellectual disability have opinions and preferences.”
        
          After Weintraub completed her statement, former Solicitor General Ted Olson called Kavanaugh “thoughtful, gracious, open-minded, respected by his peers,” and “widely praised by lawyers who appeared before him.” That category includes Olson, who has argued more than 60 cases before the Supreme Court and will undoubtedly argue before Kavanaugh at SCOTUS.
        
          Alicia Baker, a “pro-life Christian and ordained minister from Indiana,” followed Olson. Baker, who did not have sex until marriage, was denied birth control coverage by her insurance company because of its “religious objections.” In 2015, Kavanaugh argued that employers could decline to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives and refuse to notify the government of its objections, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill instead. Through tears, Baker explained the humiliating real-world impact of this denial, explaining how she and her husband “scrounged together the money” they would have spent on student loans and a house to pay for her IUD. “What happens to those,” she asked, “who face an impossible choice between getting the health care they need and putting food on the table?”
        
          Then Colleen E. Roh Sinzdak, an appellate litigator, spoke. Sinzdak explained that she took Kavanaugh’s separation of powers class at Harvard Law School and really enjoyed it.
        
          After a break for lunch, Parkland survivor Aalayah Eastmond took her turn at the microphone. She described in devastating detail how she saw her young friends get slaughtered in the classroom, how her classmate’s “lifeless body” shielded her from bullets, how she called her mom to say her “last goodbye,” how she wished the bullet would go through her head so she wouldn’t “endure any pain.” Eastmond noted that Kavanaugh voted to strike down a ban on assault weapons—including the AR-15 that was used to kill her friends. She pleaded with senators not to support Kavanaugh, to think about their votes “as if you had to justify and defend your choice to those who we lost to gun violence.”
        
          And then, in a startling juxtaposition, Rebecca Taibleson—a Kavanaugh clerk who worked for the judge during the term when he wrote his pro-gun opinion—spoke in his favor. Taibleson did not respond to Eastmond. Instead, she praised Kavanaugh’s “open mind” and “foundational commitment to the belief that either side might be right.”
        
          “Judge Kavanaugh reads and analyzes every brief and rereads every relevant precedent,” Taibleson said with a broad smile. “He insists that his clerks find the very best version of every argument in the case even when the lawyers themselves have not.”
        
          Then came Hunter LaChance, a Maine teenager who suffers from asthma—like a disproportionate number of Mainers, due to heavy air pollution in the state. Emissions from the rest of the country travel downwind to Maine, “the end of America’s tailpipe” as LaChance described it. Kavanaugh has written two opinions sharply limiting the federal government’s authority to regulate air pollution across state lines.
        
          “Here is a coffee stirrer,” LaChance said, holding up a tiny straw. “Imagine only being able to breathe through this size hole for an hour, a day, or even a week. This is what it’s been like [for me] during an asthmatic attack.” He begged senators to vote against Kavanaugh to ensure that the government could protect him and other asthma patients.
        
          If the testimony of Garza, Eastmond, and LaChance troubled the pro-Kavanaugh witnesses, they didn’t let on to it. As my colleague Dahlia Lithwick has written, Kavanaugh’s friends have every right to think he’s a lovely man, but these personal characteristics have absolutely no bearing on his judicial philosophy. On the bench, Kavanaugh will warp the law to uphold abortion bans, strike down gun restrictions, and invalidate air regulations. That is what matters, even though the nominee refused to say a word about them during the hearings. And the witnesses who testified against Kavanaugh on Friday were brave to point it out, even if their words will have no effect on Republican senators.
        
          Melissa Murray, a professor at New York University School of Law, put it best during her brief but biting testimony. “This nomination is not about … with whom I would have lunch,” Murray said. “It is not about how Brett Kavanaugh treats a handful of women from elite institutions. It is about real people on the ground … who will not have lunch with Brett Kavanaugh.”

          For all the contentiousness so far of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, the question of the nominee’s recusal from cases testing the president’s legal immunities seems to be fading from view. However, if the record is clear on any point, it is that the case for recusal is stronger than ever.
        
          Contrary to some early commentary on the topic, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has not addressed simply in passing or in ambiguous terms whether a president is immune from indictment—and perhaps even investigation—while in office. He has written at length on his view that the president should enjoy that immunity as a matter of constitutional law, and he has spoken publicly about it. Now he suggests that he meant only that this was a matter for Congress to consider and address. The developing record, augmented by his testimony before the committee, is inconsistent with his reassurances.
        
          Consider the gloss he is now putting on his previously stated and published belief that the Constitution “seems to dictate” that Congress, not federal prosecutors, can investigate a sitting president and that the Constitution “appears to preclude” prosecution of the president when in office.
        
          One of the most important moments in the hearings came on Thursday in an exchange with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who confronted Judge Kavanaugh with images of his participation at a Georgetown University panel in 1998. During that panel discussion, he was specifically invited to participate in a show of hands on the question of whether “as a matter of law” the president was immune from indictment. He raised his hand.
        
          Judge Kavanaugh now suggests that he meant only that the Office of Legal Counsel has taken this position and in this sense has established “law” for the executive branch. This is a strained and implausible reconstruction of the record. It is one thing to acknowledge that the department might be bound by OLC opinions as a matter of rule or policy; it is quite another to refer to those opinions as “law.” And yet it is to “law” that he specifically referred.
        
          At no time in that panel discussion, and certainly not prior to or after the call for the panelists to indicate their positions, did Kavanaugh qualify for the audience what they were to understand by the reference to “law.” The question before the panelists did not concern the OLC’s position but instead the president’s immunity “as a matter of law.”
        
          In fact, the history of the OLC’s position could not possibly have informed the question put to the panel. Certainly the panel would not be asked whether to indicate its agreement with the proposition that OLC opinions are binding on the executive branch. It’s not an interesting question; there is little disagreement about it (except, as some argued, in the case of a special prosecutor or independent counsel, and that too was not the subject of the inquiry.) The panel was asked specifically about the law governing a president’s vulnerability to prosecution when in office. The question was raised in response to Kavanaugh’s specific remarks favoring presidential immunity, and Kavanaugh raised his hand—as unequivocal a statement of position as is possible, on the order of giving a “Yes.” There is no doubt that he understood the question and knew what answer he was conveying. For the panel was then also asked for a show of hands from those who thought a president could be indicted while in office. Kavanaugh did not raise his.
        
          What’s more, the panel was for a symposium organized by the Georgetown Law Journal. A few months later, Kavanaugh published his written contribution to the symposium, and it is in this law-review article that he cites the Framers and the text of the Constitution chapter and verse for his view that “the Constitution itself seems to dictate, in addition, that congressional investigation must take place in lieu of criminal investigation when the President is the subject of investigation, and that criminal prosecution can occur only after the President has left office.”
        
          We’re now to the point where Judge Kavanaugh’s parsing and semantic qualifications are plain to observe. So there is a question, a very live one, of whether, if confirmed, he would come to the court committed on this constitutional position. That question will not be resolved as a result of the hearings. He will stick to his current position, the Democrats will dispute it, and the Republicans will stand by him. But it is impossible to escape the uncertainty on this point, which should be enough for a justice concerned with the legitimacy of the court and public perceptions of the standing of the justices to remove himself from any of the court’s engagement with these issues.
        
          It is striking that in his testimony, Judge Kavanaugh also states the test for the required “open-mindedness” on issues that come before the court. He told Sen. Diane Feinstein:
        
          If a case came up where someone trying to say this is a constitutional principle, I would have a completely open mind on that because I’ve never taken a position on the Constitution on that question.
        
          Judge Kavanaugh was correct to hold those two factors up as the standard: whether he has “taken a position” on the constitutional question and whether he would therefore be able to approach such a case with an “open mind.” It could not now be clearer that, as a result of his writings and public statements, Judge Kavanaugh cannot meet his own test of “open-mindedness.” If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh should have to recuse himself from participation in any cases that take up these issues of presidential immunities. And it should now go without saying that any such recusal would have to cover both a president’s immunity from investigation as well as indictment and prosecution.
        
          This is a point that needs to be pressed.

          During Thursday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, Sen. Cory Booker declared he was having an “I am Spartacus” moment. Booker said that, at the risk of “potential ousting from Senate,” he was releasing “committee confidential” documents regarding Kavanaugh’s opinions on affirmative action and racial profiling during his time working in President George W. Bush’s White House counsel’s office.
        
          The documents themselves didn’t reveal much we didn’t already know about Kavanaugh’s views. They show that he took a strong stance against what he described as a “naked racial set-aside” in Department of Transportation regulations governing affirmative action, and that he also took part in a conversation that considered racial profiling in airport security immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. (Kavanaugh said he opposed racial profiling in the long-term, but seemed open to it in the short-term.)
        
          What was more instructive about Thursday’s events was what they demonstrated about the process through which the committee has collected information about Kavanaugh’s time working in the Bush White House. The emails Booker released were not classified in any way and had no identifying information that could have reasonably led them to be labeled “committee confidential.” They were withheld from public view by attorney Bill Burck, a friend and former colleague of Kavanaugh’s who is managing the document request process for the Bush Presidential Library. Burck’s potential conflicts of interest don’t end there: He is representing Don McGahn, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of President Donald Trump’s campaign. Questions in that case could easily appear before the Supreme Court. Further, McGahn was responsible for shepherding Kavanaugh through the confirmation process.
        
          The documents Booker revealed show that Burck took an expansive approach to guarding information. After chastising Booker for going rogue, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ultimately released the emails in question, as well as those requested by a number of other Democratic senators. Burck then issued a statement saying he had authorized the document release and mocking Booker’s “histrionics.”
        
          This would all seem to take some of the air out of Booker’s “Spartacus” moment and eliminate any need for potential proceedings against him for violating Senate rules, which Booker dared his colleagues on the Republican aisle to begin, saying, “Bring it on.” During previous judicial nominations, the committee had allowed for documents to be designated “committee confidential” on the basis of bipartisan agreement. This time, that designation was controlled by Grassley, according to the Iowa senator, as part of a deal with Burck. So the lawyer for the current White House counsel, who also happens to be a close friend of the nominee, teamed up with the Republican committee chairman to decree that certain documents were not fit for public consumption, and they did so without any apparent rational basis. Burck himself seemed to concede as much when he stated that he had changed his mind and was allowing the emails to be public.
        
          While the Booker releases were not earth-shattering, Kavanaugh left a long paper trail during his years working in the White House, and some of that paper trail directly contradicts previous testimony Kavanaugh has given to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Progressive groups on Wednesday had called for Senate Democrats to go further and release all of the “committee confidential” documents to the public before the hearings were over, though there’s no indication that Booker or anyone else on the committee plans to do so.
        
          If the limited document production Democrats were able to induce suggests Kavanaugh has repeatedly misled the committee in the past, it’s no wonder that they are desperate to fight for the remaining documents. Grassley has not sought documents from Kavanaugh’s time as staff secretary for Bush, a period the judge has described as formative. Of the documents from his time in the White House Counsel’s office that were requested, the Trump administration has sought to privilege 100,000 of those without any challenge from the committee. The National Archives, which would normally manage this entire process, has said it has nothing to do with Burck’s decision-making. Burck only took charge because the Archives needed until the end of October to complete the document review and Republicans, hoping to confirm the nominee before this November’s midterm elections, insisted it go ahead outside of the normal schedule.
        
          As Booker said of one of the emails in question: “The fact that there is nothing in the document that’s personal information, there’s nothing national security-related, the fact that it was labeled as committee confidential, exposes that this process, sir, is a bit of a sham.”
        
          That sham will help Kavanaugh be elevated to a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.

          Ah, sports. No confirmation hearing can be complete without a little small talk about which teams the senator supports, and which sports the nominee plays, and which sporting events the nominee likens his job to, and also which sports the senator likens the confirmation process to. It’s a kind of shorthand way of everyone having a beer in the Senate chamber. We’re all just sports fans here, talking about, you know, sports.
        
          At the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, these endless invocations of teamwork and coaching girls’ basketball start to ring a bit hollow as a metaphor for doing justice. No matter how many times we talk about fair play, there can be no denying that what has happened this week in the Senate Judiciary Committee is neither sporting nor bound by any rules.
        
          For one thing, we are witnessing a confirmation process that is being guided by committee practices crafted on the fly. As arcane as the fight over thousands of pages of “committee confidential” documents may seem, the fact is that the great bulk of Kavanaugh’s documents have not been released. They are being vetted not by the National Archives but by a Republican lawyer. Senate Democrats on Thursday announced that they are willing to publicly release committee-confidential documents and suffer the consequences, in part because if this were a sporting event, it would be clear by now that the umpire uniforms are issued to only one side.
        
          But the sports chat rankles even more because all the talk in the abstract about coaching girls’ basketball is happening as real women are screaming about their real bodies as they’re being physically dragged out of the Senate chamber by police. Sen. Orrin Hatch may fuss about ugly public outbursts, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley can pretend this is all media fakery engineered by Democrats, but the reality is that a whole lot of mostly white men are talking about the fact that the fate of women’s bodies will be decided by a federal judge who is pretending he has no opinions on this matter, and this will have very real impacts on women for generations to come. As much as the white male Republicans on the committee might roll their eyes and deplore incivility, women are very, very angry about all this, and they are expressing it corporeally. That isn’t a sporting event. It is life and death.
        
          Nobody doubts that Judge Kavanaugh loves his daughters and their teammates. They are not the ones who will be hurt if and when safe and legal and affordable abortion is denied to the poorest, youngest, and most vulnerable women in the country, and they are not the ones who will lose access to health insurance that covers pre-existing conditions or reproductive care. Wealthy women had access to quality health care, contraception, and abortion before Roe, and they will have it after. The women being dragged bodily out of the chamber are screaming in no small part because there are children being dragged from their families this week—in violation of a consent decree and a court order—and they don’t have the benefit of Senate rules of regular order. That too isn’t a sporting event. That too is life and death.
        
          Perhaps that’s why one of the most gripping moments of the hearings came late Wednesday night when Sen. Kamala Harris asked whether Kavanaugh was aware of any laws “that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body.” It was not a legal question. It was simply a way to make concrete what has been happening all week. Kavanaugh’s response—“I’m not thinking of any right now, senator”—was perfectly truthful. There are none. That’s why a roomful of men talking about undue burdens in Planned Parenthood v. Casey isn’t a sporting event for these spectators. When Sen. Lindsey Graham smugly told the nominee on Thursday morning that “the last time I checked, liberty didn’t equate to abortion,” that wasn’t a performance. It was a promise.
        
          The most laughable manifestation of the “It’s all just sports” talk this week comes in the invocation, again, of the trite metaphor that Supreme Court justices are mere umpires. The neutral umpire claim was laughable when John Roberts minted it, and it is even more trite today. Senate Republicans, including Ted Cruz, continue to try to claim that Brett Kavanaugh isn’t a partisan by highlighting the congruence between his voting record and that of Merrick Garland—the same Merrick Garland to whom they denied a hearing and vote. If their records are the same, then why was Garland precluded from getting a hearing? Again, let’s note that the “neutral” umpire uniforms are issued to only one side.
        
          In some sense, the “smoking guns” of the Kavanaugh hearing are no different than the revelations in the Bob Woodward book and the New York Times’ anonymous op-ed. They keep showing, time and again, that what we all suspected to be true is in fact true: Brett Kavanaugh is a lifelong movement conservative who will vote as he has voted for years—as a movement conservative. That is likely unstoppable. But this is not a sporting event and it’s not a contest constrained by any existing rules. On Thursday morning, Sen. Dick Durbin reminded the chamber that protesters are the “cost of democracy”— but in this hearing they are also the casualties of it. It’s not a game when the spectators are also the victims.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/the-brett-kavanaugh-document-cover-up-is-a-stain-on-the-senate.html,"
          The Senate is now considering President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Whoever replaces Justice Kennedy, the deciding vote in so many fundamental cases, the trajectory of the court for a generation is at stake. More immediately, the Kavanaugh nomination presents stark questions about the court’s looming role in fundamental rule-of-law questions that could come to a head as the president continues to attack federal law enforcement while his lawyers construct a defense that would put the president above the law. These are questions less about political party than presidential power, checks and balances, and the separation of powers.
        
          Given these stakes, it is evermore vital to evaluate the claim that the procedures that are being adopted to push Judge Kavanaugh through to a vote run contrary to constitutional and democratic norms. That evaluation requires a detailed and fair-minded understanding of the rationales being offered for withholding information from the public and the Senate about Judge Kavanaugh’s time in government and the executive branch interests at stake. It is also shortsighted given the likelihood that roles will eventually be reversed, with a Democratic president and Democrat-controlled Senate.
        
          Beyond the pressing issues of substance, this confirmation process has been awful and a regrettable stain on the legacy of Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa. To be sure, Democrats have large political incentives to seize on the Sen. Grassley and the White House’s procedural monkey business in an effort to slow down Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. At the same time, after the Senate Republicans refused to grant the courtesy of a hearing for President Barack Obama’s nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat, Democrats are right to decry the further institutional damage to the Senate’s constitutional duty to provide advice and consent.
        
          Sen. Grassley, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has run a process dictated by the political calendar and raw power instead of one designed to provide the information necessary for sober advice and consent and meaningful public conversation. The Trump administration and President George W. Bush’s legal-archives representatives, in league with Chairman Grassley, have withheld hundreds of thousands of documents from the committee by artificially narrowing the universe of relevant documents and broadly asserting executive privilege. As a result, senators do not have access to huge swaths of documents reflecting Judge Kavanaugh’s service in the White House under President Bush.
        
          Late-night document dumps and untested privilege claims have become the coin of the realm.
        
          On the eve of Judge Kavanaugh’s first day of hearings, President Bush’s lead lawyer, Bill Burck, produced about 42,000 pages of documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the White House Counsel’s Office. That eleventh-hour dump followed Burck’s document production on the Friday night going into Labor Day weekend. It has been enough to make even a practitioner of the dark arts blush. In what has been amusingly referred to as the “Friday night document massacre,” Burck’s cover letter provided a series of rationales for withholding an astonishing number and percentage of documents that would inform senators about Judge Kavanaugh’s fitness for this lifetime appointment.
        
          I spent several years in a similar role as Vice President Gore’s designated archives representative. Like Burck, I reviewed Gore records for responsiveness to subpoenas or congressional requests as well as potential executive-privilege claims after he left office. I have also had some experience with last-minute document-production shenanigans from Burck (who is a very capable lawyer to whom I have referred potential clients). Here is how his letter breaks down the “great winnowing” of documents.
        
          Burck previews four categories of withheld documents: (1) duplicates, (2) personal documents not covered by the Presidential Records Act, (3) “presidential records that fell outside the time of Judge Kavanaugh’s service in the White House Counsel’s Office,” and (4) “presidential records protected by constitutional privilege.”
        
          The first two categories are fairly straightforward and do not require much comment, although I would note that back in my day personal was the designation used by the National Archives and Records Administration for political and campaign records in addition to, say, a grocery list. To the extent that senators wanted to review Judge Kavanaugh’s role in the Bush political operation, this letter is obliquely informing the reader that those documents won’t be in this production.
        
          The third category is a major point of contention in the Judge Kavanaugh confirmation fight. That language informs the astute reader that Judge Kavanaugh’s time as White House staff secretary has been excluded. That is an incredibly important and senior West Wing job, and Judge Kavanaugh has described his years as White House staff secretary as the “most interesting and in many ways among the most instructive” to his experience as a judge. On one hand, I am not persuaded that the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh—as crucial as it is—would entitle the Senate free range over every document President Bush’s staff secretary handled. On the other hand, those staff secretary documents are sure to contain information core to the Senate’s constitutional interests in his qualifications for the Supreme Court. Here, that exception to this document production threatens to swallow the broader document-disclosure enterprise.
        
          The fourth category is executive privilege. According to Burck, the White House made the final privilege calls: “The White House, after consultation with the Department of Justice, has directed that we not provide these documents.” The documents withheld on privilege grounds contains upward of 100,000 pages of material. That is a large number.
        
          It is also contrary to very recent precedent: President Obama overcame any executive-privilege concerns with respect to documents related to Elena Kagan’s service in White House Counsel’s Office under President Bill Clinton and as solicitor general under President Obama. Executive branch confidentiality interests dissipate over time. They were certainly more acute in the Kagan context—documents involving the sitting president’s solicitor general—than those of Judge Kavanaugh’s service over a decade ago.
        
          But neither the extraordinary breadth of the Kavanaugh-related privilege claims nor the departure from recent precedent resolve whether there is merit to the claims. That requires a document-by-document analysis. As I have argued at length in a law-review article, the winner of a tussle between Congress and the White House over claims of privilege is a dynamic function of legal merit and the relative political leverage related to that particular issue at that particular time.
        
          For these hearings, we do not have a full assessment of the legal merit, and the Senate appears poised to surrender—without even a fight—its leverage to get answers. What would a genuine process look like? Assessing the legal merit would require the Senate to scrutinize the asserted privileges by demanding document-level justifications in a privilege log. Further, the Senate’s leverage to pry loose documents claimed to be privileged is at its apex when the president is motivated is motivated to get someone confirmed. One need look no further than the sensitive documents related to the Benghazi attack that President Obama provided as the price of John Brennan’s confirmation as CIA director or the bipartisan demand that the Obama administration produce the Office of Legal Counsel opinion drafted by David Barron outlining the legal rationale for targeting Anwar al-Awlaki with a drone strike in connection with his confirmation to be a judge on the 1st Circuit.
        
          Finally, we don’t have much information about the 42,390 pages Burck produced after his Friday letter and on the eve of the hearings. Based on the Washington Post report, “No information was released on the subject matter of the documents, and Bush’s lawyer asked that they be kept from the public, made available only to committee members and staff.”
        
          I am not here to argue that the Kavanaugh-related claims of privilege are bogus or that executive branch concerns about a Senate free-for-all on President Bush’s Oval Office document manager’s records are without merit. But the Senate should be fulfilling its advice-and-consent obligations under the Constitution. To do so, it needs to clarify its chief information interests in Kavanaugh’s record while pressing the executive branch to justify its blanket refusals and privilege claims.
        
          An orderly accommodation process to evaluate Judge Kavanaugh’s record would take time. Unfortunately, the political calendar, rather than regular order, is in the driver’s seat.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-roe-v-wade.html,"
          Susan Collins talks a big game about reproductive rights. The Republican senator from Maine has said, for instance, that she wants her party to be “as synonymous with protecting a woman’s right to choose as the Democratic Party is with expanded government or raising taxes.” While her party certainly hasn’t met that standard, Collins—who has a 72 percent rating on Planned Parenthood’s legislative scorecard—has walked the walk more often than not, defying the GOP by voting in favor of women’s health care. Recently, she drew praise from abortion-rights advocates for splitting from Republicans to reject a “skinny repeal” of the Affordable Care Act, backing up her vote with a strong defense of public funding for Planned Parenthood.
        
          If Collins votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court —and there is every indication that she will—she can kiss that well-earned goodwill goodbye. While Collins has voted to confirm other conservative nominees to the Supreme Court, including Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and John Roberts, the Kavanaugh nomination has the potential to have much more dire consequences, given that the balance of the court is now at risk. Abortion-rights activists who have helped shore up her pro-choice reputation likely won’t forgive her for voting for a justice widely believed to be the fifth vote the Supreme Court needs to gut or overturn Roe v. Wade.
        
          “Reproductive rights organizations have worked alongside [Collins’] office to support her” when she votes against her party on issues of abortion rights, said Diana Thu-Thao Rhodes, director of public policy at the nonprofit Advocates for Youth. In the past, Collins has co-sponsored and supported several bills Advocates for Youth lobbied for, including one that would have permanently eliminated the global gag rule. “If she does vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh … that would definitely be a turning point in her relationship with reproductive rights organizations and make a really big statement on what her priorities are,” said Rhodes.
        
          It’s clear that reproductive rights groups have helped sustain Collins’ political career. More than two-thirds of Maine residents believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a larger proportion than in any other state besides New Hampshire and Vermont. (A smaller majority of the U.S. population—57 percent—says the same.) Maine likely would not have kept Collins in the Senate for 20 years without her pro-choice bona fides.
        
          NARAL political director Nicole Brener-Schmitz told me Collins’ reputation—and her organization’s opinion of the senator—are now in the balance. “Trump made no bones about the fact that he had one litmus test, and his litmus test was [overturning] Roe, and that anyone he nominated fulfilled that,” Brener-Schmitz said. “She knows that. We know that. Her voters know that.”
        
          NARAL doesn’t necessarily consider Collins a reliable ally—she got only a 40 percent rating on the organization’s 2017 scorecard, in large part because of her votes to confirm Trump’s Cabinet nominees and lower-court judges. In previous years, she’s gotten more validation from NARAL, if not an outright endorsement; in 2014, her most recent election year, the organization gave her a 90 percent rating. Of the two major reproductive-rights groups, Planned Parenthood has been louder in its support for Collins, in part because she’s cast several critical votes to protect its funding through Medicaid reimbursements. Planned Parenthood, which has endorsed Collins in the past, went so far as to admonish her Democratic opponent in 2014 for falsely claiming that Collins had voted to defund the group. “When it mattered most, Sen. Collins voted with us and stood with Planned Parenthood, and with women. We think it’s important that people know that,” a spokesman said at the time. (Planned Parenthood declined to comment on the record about Collins for this piece.)
        
          Although Collins has said she will oppose any nominee who shows “hostility” toward Roe v. Wade, she seems dead-set on ignoring Trump’s explicit promise to nominate only anti-Roe judges. Instead, she has hung her support for Kavanaugh on the idea of “settled law,” and the moderate-soothing claim that nominees who say they support the supremacy of court precedent will never overturn decisions like Roe. This was an essential factor in Collins’ vote to confirm Gorsuch. “I had a very long discussion with Justice Gorsuch in my office and he pointed out to me that he is the co-author of a whole book on precedent,” she recently said. Nevertheless, in his first year on the court, Gorsuch has voted to overrule court precedent on multiple occasions, including in the Janus v. AFSCME decision that will hobble public-sector unions.
        
          According to “a source close to Collins’ staff” who spoke to HuffPost, Collins preapproved Kavanaugh in her discussions with Trump before he officially announced the judge as his nominee. Collins’ spokeswoman says the senator never did such a thing. Nevertheless, she has already said that Kavanaugh told her he considers Roe “settled law,” which appears to be her magic phrase. That conversation, when paired with Collins’ record of confirming every single one of Trump’s radically anti-abortion lower-court nominees, suggests she doesn’t intend to make any kind of dramatic last-minute stand to protect women’s right to abortion.
        
          Given that Republicans have such a slim majority in the Senate, Collins could almost singlehandedly torpedo Kavanaugh’s nomination. Leaving that influence on the table would be Collins’ “final betrayal” of the reproductive-rights movement, NARAL President Ilyse Hogue told HuffPost. Less than a year ago, Planned Parenthood bestowed Collins with an award honoring her place among “Republican lawmakers who champion reproductive health care issues and who fight to ensure the rights granted to women.” It’s fair to say that if Collins votes to confirm Kavanaugh, she won’t be winning any more awards from Planned Parenthood or any other pro-choice organization. “It’s very difficult to call yourself pro-choice when you are actively seating the person who has committed to overturning Roe,” Brener-Schmitz said. “That is the most basic of basics of being pro-choice: that abortion should be legal and accessible for women.”
        
          Many of Collins’ constituents have spent the past few weeks trying to drive that message home. “If Susan Collins is truly pro-choice, she should keep Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court,” wrote Samantha Paradis, a nurse and the mayor of Belfast, Maine, in a Monday editorial in the Bangor Daily News. Activists are sending clothes hangers to her office, and Maine residents who’ve had abortions are showing up to lobby her staff. One Maine woman, an independent voter named Michelle Fish, appears in a NARAL ad currently running on Maine television stations. She details the abortion she had at age 18, when she was in “a very abusive relationship” and had to “make a choice to take care of myself.” For her two daughters, “that choice is in grave danger,” Fish says in the ad. “I voted for Sen. Collins twice, but I’m worried I won’t be able to do that again.”
        
          Advocacy groups are already making plans to hold Collins accountable should she cast a deciding vote for Kavanaugh. When she was up for re-election in 2014, she beat her Democratic opponent by more than 36 percentage points; a few months ago, a Morning Consult poll reported that she was the country’s 11th-most popular senator. That could change if Maine voters watch her play a crucial role in decimating abortion rights in America. Well-funded reproductive-rights organizations that had no reason to waste resources on opposing an extremely popular pro-choice Republican will have a new set of calculations to consider when Collins comes back up for re-election. “If she votes to confirm [Kavanaugh], we will obviously be taking a very close look at this race in 2020,” Brener-Schmitz said. “It will absolutely be a priority of ours to be engaged in who’s being recruited into that seat.”
        
          Collins could be ready for retirement, in which case she may see this pivotal vote as one of the final acts of her political career. Then again, Collins is only 65 and recently considered a run for governor; in all likelihood, she’ll try to stay in public office for at least a few more terms. The last time Collins ran for re-election, national Democratic fundraising groups didn’t spend a single dollar on her challenger, Shenna Bellows. If she votes to confirm Kavanaugh, they might find it worthwhile to find and fund a strong candidate to run against her next time. And if Collins runs for governor in 2022, as she opted not to do this year, a Kavanaugh vote could be a major liability for an opponent to exploit. By then, the Supreme Court will have ruled on several cases pertaining to abortion and contraception rights and access. If Kavanaugh is on the bench, the decisions will be brutal. It will be up to Democrats and reproductive-rights groups to remind Maine voters that Collins, not just Trump and Kavanaugh, is to blame.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-ben-sasse.html,"
          Ben Sasse loves to wax poetic about the constitutional separation of powers, which is odd considering that he adamantly refuses to enforce them. Nevertheless, Sasse’s fixation is quaintly charming at a time when most Republican politicians prefer to skip the civics lectures and just own the libs. During Tuesday’s confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, the Republican senator from Nebraska devoted his opening statement to a disquisition on the three branches of government, tying the politicization of Supreme Court nominations to the decline of legislative independence. The courts, Sasse insisted, have become political because Congress stopped passing laws, instead leaving lawmaking to “power hungry executive branch bureaucrats” with no democratic accountability.
        
          Sasse’s theory is very interesting, but not because it’s original (it’s cobbled together from white papers belched out by conservative think tanks) or correct (it isn’t). Rather, it’s worth highlighting because it aligns perfectly with Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence, as well as the Trump administration’s agenda. Sasse and Kavanaugh believe the president cannot be questioned or restrained, but executive agencies must be ruthlessly crushed. That’s what “separation of powers” means to the GOP in 2018, and it’s what Kavanaugh is poised to enshrine in our Constitution.
        
          To be sure, America’s founding charter creates stark divisions between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. And it undoubtedly expects Congress to act as a check upon the president—not just by passing those laws that the president must then enforce, but by conducting oversight into his exercise of executive authority. Sasse was absolutely correct when he declared on Tuesday that “the legislative branch is supposed to be the locus of our politics.” But it is puzzling to hear him express this sentiment when he has relinquished his own constitutional duties and pursued an approach of checking the executive branch via tweet and press release. Instead of pushing for legislation or hearings that might rein in Trump’s excesses, Sasse issues strongly worded statements. That is not how the Framers envisioned Congress restraining the chief executive.
        
          When Sasse perorates about separation of powers, then, he could not possibly be referring to legislative limitations on presidential excesses. So, what is he talking about? Here’s how Sasse framed the putative problem on Tuesday:
        
          While Sasse is not troubled by an imperial president who amasses an unprecedented amount of power in a single branch and wields it with spite and caprice, he is upset that executive branch agencies exist and do things. That is the thrust of the senator’s statement: The “administrative state,” an entrenched and unsanctioned “fourth branch of government,” allegedly rules “the people” while Congress withers on the vine.
        
          What, exactly, is this sinister “administrative state”? In short, it comprises those agencies that the Trump administration is trying to defang or destroy. There are dozens of them, but only a few are familiar to most Americans. The Departments of Education, Labor, Justice, State, and Transportation. The Environmental Protection Agency. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established to regulate Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash. Congress passed laws creating these agencies, tasking them with implementing a complex set of regulations that legislators are too busy, lazy, or inexperienced to execute on a continual basis. The “administrative state” is what keeps mercury out of your air, discrimination out of your schools, and predatory lenders out of your wallet.
        
          Or at least it did, until the Trump White House began slashing regulations and hobbling agencies to prevent them from carrying out their core missions. This administration shares Sasse’s belief that executive agencies are if not illegitimate, then inherently suspect, and that most of the rules they promulgate should be repealed. The true threat to the separation of powers, according to Sasse and the White House, isn’t a legislative branch that kowtows to the executive’s every whim. It’s the existence of agencies that attempt to interpret and enforce federal law in a coherent and consistent manner.
        
          Justice Clarence Thomas also shares this opposition to the “administrative state,” which partly explains why so many of his clerks have gone on to serve in the Trump administration. So does Brett Kavanaugh. In one of his most famous dissents, Kavanaugh declared war on what he called “a headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government.” He asserted that the CFPB is unconstitutional because it is run by a single director who serves a five-year term and cannot be removed by the president without cause. Framing the case as one “about executive power and individual liberty,” Kavanaugh claimed that the president must be allowed to fire the CFPB’s director at will. Along the way, he cast doubt on the constitutionality of a law creating a special counsel, a piece of legislation that the Supreme Court declared constitutional in a 7–1 ruling.
        
          The leitmotif of this dissent—as well as his many other anti-regulatory opinions—is that the president himself has vast powers to govern the country as he sees fit, and may even refuse to enforce laws he dislikes. Meanwhile, executive agencies must have extremely limited authority to carry out the duties Congress assigned to them, lest they stray from the will of the president and bring about “tyranny.”
        
          This theory is music to the ears of plutocrat Republican donors and corporations who dislike regulations. It is also nonsensical. Kavanaugh, like Sasse, thinks executive agencies are “unaccountable.” Yet their actions are governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, which requires them to publish proposed rules in advance, explain their justifications, and accept public comments. Once the agencies’ rules are formalized, they are subject to a range of court challenges—as the Trump administration knows, since many of its rules have been invalidated for being arbitrary and capricious.
        
          Moreover, the “power hungry executive branch bureaucrats” that Sasse condemned actually are pretty accountable. They are certainly more democratically accountable than life-tenured federal judges, to whom Sasse and Kavanaugh would prefer to give the final say on the meaning of ambiguous federal laws. Each president gets to appoint new Cabinet secretaries and stock agencies with “bureaucrats” who will carry out their mission. The president can also fire many of these top-ranking officials, as Trump has gleefully illustrated. If the people don’t like the president’s choices, they can vote him out. Most agency heads are also Senate-confirmed; if the people dislike them, they can vote out the senators who approved them.
        
          Sasse views these agencies as a fundamental threat to democracy. Kavanaugh appears to, as well, although he surely won’t admit it during this week’s hearings. Their frustration is misplaced. True, the federal government is currently failing to live up to the Framers’ expectations, but that’s not because of the CFPB (which Sasse loathes as much as Kavanaugh does). It’s because Congress won’t do its job and serve as a check on Trump. Unfortunately, neither Sasse nor Kavanaugh has any desire to change that. Once on the court, Kavanaugh will carry out Sasse’s agenda of crushing agencies while expanding presidential power. Sasse will call that a triumph for the Constitution. In reality, it’s just a victory for the Republican Party.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-democrats-focused-on-missing-documents-and-wasted-day-one.html,"
          Heading into Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing Tuesday morning, my unofficial over/under on how many words Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley could get through before a protester interrupted him was 14.5. Sure enough, it was just before the 14th word when that interruption happened. Only it wasn’t a member of the public disrupting the proceedings (yet): It was California Sen. Kamala Harris. She, like all of the Democrats on the committee in the first hour of the hearing, had complaints about the process, such as the 42,000 documents sent for senators to review on a rushed basis the previous night.
        
          After Harris spoke, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker chimed in to complain about the same with his trademark, hammed-up flourishes. (“This is a violation of the values that we as a committee have striven for,” etc.) Then Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal called for a vote to adjourn until senators had more time to review the records. Grassley, who tried to stay patient as Democrats executed their very foreseeable, scripted protest, denied the request as out-of-order several times. Sens. Mazie Hirono, Chris Coons, and Amy Klobuchar read their lines. And on down the roster.
        
          When the actual protests got going, they were just as planned, but didn’t follow the Democratic committee members’ lead. The citizen protesters, many of them organized by the leaders of the Women’s March, didn’t scream about the hidden 100,000 or 42,000 or however many documents. They spoke about their reproductive rights. One women, whom Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch referred to as a “loudmouth,” said she would die without protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Others spoke up about gun violence, or how Kavanaugh was a tool of big business.
        
          The contrast between what protesters were screaming about and what the Democrats behind the dais were focused on—the real-world impact of a Justice Kavanaugh versus the procedure surrounding his nomination—spoke to a persistent problem that seems destined to help Kavanaugh sail through: Democratic senators are too addicted to the document drama, and the unknown contained in those docs, to settle on a sustained line of attack on what they already know about Kavanaugh.
        
          It would be surprising if a single Republican in the country was rattled by the Democrats’ document stunt. They’re more than happy to have Democrats focused on procedure. In fact, Tuesday’s opening session was when it settled in that Republicans probably had been baiting Democrats into emphasizing this line of opposition all along. Why else would you dump another 42,000 documents into their laps the night before the hearing, if not to send them into spasms of procedural complaint that distract from the imminent rightward shift of American jurisprudence? Why else would White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah walk through the press tables during the lunch break passing out a fact sheet noting that Democrats offered 80 “complaints about documents or records”?
        
          Some Democrats seem to get the problem here. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the committee, began her opening statement not with gripes about document production but by laying out what’s at stake. She jumped right into Roe, insisting that the question isn’t whether it’s “settled law,” but whether “you believe that it’s correct law.”
        
          “I was, in the ’50s and ’60s, active first as a student at Stanford, I saw what happened to young women who became pregnant,” she said. “So what women have won through Roe and a host of privacy cases to be able to control their own reproductive system, to have basic privacy rights, [is] really extraordinarily important to this side of the aisle, and I hope the other side of the aisle as well.” Feinstein followed up by speaking about Kavanaugh’s writings on the Second Amendment.
        
          Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse might have had the strongest opening remarks in laying out the “sham” of “confirmation etiquette”—the pablum nominees offer about “calling balls and strikes” and respecting precedent in order to attain their seats, at which point they bust through whatever precedent they want in order to, say, benefit big business. “Kavanaugh knows the game,” Whitehouse said. “In the Bush White House, he coached judicial nominees to just tell senators that they will adhere to statutory text, that they have no ideological agenda. Fairy tales.”
        
          When Democrats are laying out what’s at stake, it’s not performative. Even if it’s rehearsed, which it is, it’s about real things that they really care about. When they’re griping about the process, their words just don’t align with their actions. If the hearing is illegitimate or corrupt because they haven’t seen enough documents, why don’t they walk out of it? Why did Cory Booker, later in the hearing, take up minutes of his time apologizing to Grassley for any insulting language he may have used earlier—when he was insisting that Grassley was complicit in a power grab that violated the values of the country? Why apologize to him if that’s what you think he’s doing?
        
          Process arguments this late in the game won’t convince Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to vote against Kavanaugh’s nomination. They’ve made clear that they’re fine with the level of document production. Democrats have all of the documents they’re ever going to have. If they haven’t found the silver bullet yet, it’s time to move on. Don’t wish in retrospect that you hadn’t made the stakes clear because you were too focused on the damning email that never materialized.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/jon-kyl-john-mccain-doug-duceys-clever-appointment-strategy.html,"
          Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has tapped former Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to fill the late John McCain’s vacant seat—for the next few months, at least. That unexpected twist comes by way of the Arizona Republic, which broke the news on Tuesday afternoon:
        
          This is not how most political observers expected this to go. Following McCain’s death, the conventional wisdom was that Ducey had two choices: He could appoint someone like Kyl or Cindy McCain as a placeholder to serve until a 2020 special election, or Ducey could pick a political up-and-comer who could then use the next two years to build up his or her name ID and campaign bank account ahead of what is sure to be a competitive contest. Instead, Ducey seems to have found a way to do both.
        
          By appointing the 76-year-old Kyl, a known quantity from his nearly two decades in the Senate and someone who is currently shepherding Brett Kavanaugh through his confirmation process, Ducey has given Mitch McConnell a reliable yes vote (more reliable than McCain’s) at a time when Republicans hold a narrow one-seat edge in the upper chamber. And then if and when Republicans finish jamming Kavanaugh’s confirmation through the Senate, Kyl can return to his high-paying gig at Covington & Burling, the D.C. law firm he joined in 2013 after leaving the Senate the last time, and Ducey can replace him with whomever the GOP establishment thinks has the best chance of holding the seat in 2020—possibly U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, if she’s defeated this November in her bid for Arizona’s other Senate seat.
        
          It’s a creative strategy and one that comes with remarkably little risk for Republicans. Ducey is up for re-election this year, yes, but even if he loses to Democratic nominee David Garcia, McCain’s seat wouldn’t be in danger of falling into Democratic hands anytime soon. Arizona law stipulates that the governor can only appoint an interim senator who is from the same party as the departed one he or she is replacing. And if the GOP believes Garcia and Democrats could appoint a moderate Republican willing to break partisan ranks, they can simply persuade Kyl to soldier on for one more year than he’d otherwise prefer.

          The Senate Judiciary Committee commenced its hearing for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination on Tuesday morning. If the mutinous beginning of the proceedings was any indication, this may be one of the most contentious nomination hearings for the high court in recent memory.
        
          Right before committee chairman Chuck Grassley tried to get the ball rolling with opening statements, Senate Democrats launched a coordinated effort to postpone the proceedings, arguing that they have not had enough time to review the 42,000 pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s tenure in the White House Counsel’s office during George W. Bush’s administration. A lawyer for Bush dumped the trove of documents hours before the hearings. Protestors, who have been gathering in and around the hearing room throughout the morning, piled on to the disruption by shouting in support of the Democratic senators. Capitol police had to apprehend the protestors and lead them out of the court room before Grassley could proceed with the opening statements.
        
          Liberals have been wringing their hands about the nomination since former Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement in June. That consternation only intensified after President Trump announced Kavanaugh’s nomination in July, as legal analysts predict that the conservative judge could help to overturn Roe v. Wade, strike down basic campaign finance limits, and perhaps even protect Trump from oversight. Democrats have been calling for the hearings to be stalled given the president’s implication in a criminal conspiracy, but to no avail.

          On Tuesday morning, as the Senate Judiciary Committee began confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats finally began to put up a real fight.
        
          Moments after Chairman Chuck Grassley attempted to commence the proceedings, Democratic senators launched a coordinated effort to halt them. Their complaint: Republicans, led by Grassley and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, rushed Kavanaugh’s confirmation in order to place him on the court as quickly as possible (and before the midterms). In the process, they’ve concealed millions of pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s work in the George W. Bush White House.
        
          The fireworks continued throughout the morning; you can watch the livestream here:
        
          Republicans refused to request documents from Kavanaugh’s three years as staff secretary, which the nominee has referred to as “the most interesting and informative for me” in preparation for his work on the bench. They’ve solicited only a fraction of documents from Kavanaugh’s work in the White House Counsel’s Office, and the National Archives, which determines which presidential records may be released, can’t finish its review until the end of October. So Republicans set up an alternate process overseen by GOP attorney William Burck to furnish some documents before then. Burck, who currently represents White House counsel Don McGahn, worked for Kavanaugh during the nominee’s tenure as staff secretary. And he now gets to decide which of his former boss’s records will be turned over to the committee.
        
          On Friday, to no one’s surprise, Burck announced that he would withhold more than 100,000 pages of documents from Kavanaugh’s service in the White House Counsel’s Office, citing (but not formally asserting) executive privilege. Then, hours before the start of the hearing, Burck dumped 42,000 pages on the committee but demanded that they not be released to the public. In sum, the senators who will soon vote on whether to give Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land have seen just a tiny fraction of the nominee’s White House records.
        
          And so, on Tuesday morning, Sen. Kamala Harris interrupted Grassley’s introduction to demand that the hearings be postponed until the committee received and reviewed a fuller range of documents.
        
          Sen. Mazie Hirono backed Harris—then protesters interrupted the proceedings and were greeted by raucous applause. As soon as they were removed, Sen. Richard Blumenthal announced his support of Harris and Hirono, describing the hearing as “a charade and a mockery of our norms.” More demonstrators then exploded in protest. Once they were removed, Sen. Cory Booker appealed to Grassley’s “sense of decency and integrity” also asked the chairman to pause the hearings, describing the document-review process as a “violation of the values I’ve heard you talk about time and time again.”
        
          “What is the rush?” Booker asked. “What are we trying to hide by not having the documents out front?”
        
          More protesters. Hirono spoke again, then Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse lodged his grievance over Burck’s dubious claim of executive privilege. Sen. Patrick Leahy seconded Whitehouse’s objections as yet more protesters shouted from the back of the room. Blumenthal and Whitehouse called for a vote on reconvening the hearings at a later date. Sen. Amy Klobuchar attempted to force a vote, but Grassley stonewalled her. This back-and-forth continued for much of the morning and it was unclear when it would end. As the Daily Caller’s Kevin Daley pointed out on Twitter, there’s one possible reason Grassley would not allow Blumenthal’s motion for a vote to adjourn to proceed.
        
          There is little chance that Democrats’ efforts will actually block Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Republicans have the votes, and the Democratic base has largely failed to show up to the Kavanaugh fight. But the senators’ objections did prove that, at a bare minimum, they recognize the fundamental illegitimacy of these hearings and refuse (for now, at least) to play along with the charade. If Democrats in the committee were fully committed to exposing the farce of these hearings, they’d simply walk out—and leave the room full of the Republican politicians and operatives who rigged the process in the first place. But failing that, a group venting of Democratic disgust is a pretty effective way to open this sorry show.

SLATE,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-hearings-democrats-will-press-on-seaworld-abortion-and-those-bush-white-house-documents.html,"
          Framing—the act of constructing a way of viewing an issue—is a fascinating political skill. And in the days leading up to Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings, I couldn’t help but get a kick out of the disparate ways Republicans and Democrats were framing their answers to the same question: How many pages of Kavanaugh’s records from his time in the George W. Bush White House have been released?
        
          Democrats responded with a percentage: Four percent of the available Kavanaugh records have been made public. Only 4 percent! Republicans, meanwhile, emphasized the astounding number of pages floating around out there: 440,500 of them, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s team declared proudly on Friday. Wowza! That’s, like, thousands of books, or hundreds of copies of the Affordable Care Act. Or, as they put it, it’s “more than the combined volume of similar material for the last five nominees confirmed to the Supreme Court.”
        
          This tedious, two-month debate about “paper” has, on its surface, been about what level of transparency is “fair” ahead of a lifetime appointment that would shift the American judiciary a degree to the right. So it’s worth reiterating, as Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings begin, that “fairness” has nothing to do with the documents fight, and it will have nothing to do with the confirmation hearings. It has nothing to do with the whole project here. Republicans want Kavanaugh confirmed because he will support their policy preferences; Democrats want him stopped because he will strike theirs down. Republicans would be fine with zero documents released to the public but felt they had to throw something out there; Democrats want the silver bullet that so far has escaped them. The confirmation hearings that begin on Tuesday will not be a good-faith bipartisan examination of Brett Kavanaugh. They will be Democrats’ last chance to make a scene, with Republicans functioning as a defensive line.
        
          So, then, what sort of scene will Democrats try to make?
        
          Democrats have been emphasizing three main areas of attack against Kavanaugh’s record, all of which appeal to the base: access to abortion, of which Kavanaugh’s not a great fan; protection for those with pre-existing conditions, as another legal threat to Obamacare begins its way through the legal system; and Kavanaugh’s expansive views of executive power. On all three issues, Kavanaugh has tried to tell the handful of distantly swayable Republican and Democratic senators with whom he’s met what they’d like to hear. Democrats believe that his lengthy trail of writings and speeches, such as his praise of the dissent in Roe v. Wade, will make it difficult for him to get away with such vague postures as declaring Roe “settled law.”
        
          Expect to hear the most you’ve heard about SeaWorld since you visited it as a child.Just as Democrats focused on the “frozen trucker” case during Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings to show his pro-business, anti-little-guy leanings, Democrats will highlight how Kavanaugh dissented from an opinion finding that SeaWorld had violated workplace safety standards when an orca named Tilikum attacked and killed one of its trainees during a performance. “When should we as a society paternalistically decide that the risk of significant physical injury is simply too great even for eager and willing participants?” Kavanaugh, unimpressed, wrote. The trainer should’ve known that whale meant business when she took the gig.
        
          Democrats will also press Kavanaugh on his unfriendly posture toward Chevron deference—the principle that courts should defer to an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute—and what that could mean for government agencies’ ability to write rules and regulations not explicitly outlined in a statute. A limitation of Chevron could sharply narrow the ability of the government to write new regulations—and make life harder for the next Democratic president.
        
          With a new legal challenge to affirmative action, now supported by the administration, making its way to the legal system, it’s quite possible that Kavanaugh’s succession of Anthony Kennedy could spell the end of affirmative action. Democrats will definitely spend time on that. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s ranking member and the strongest gun control advocate in the Senate, will challenge Kavanaugh on his expansive view of the Second Amendment, and Sens. Dick Durbin and Pat Leahy, who both served on the Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh’s 2006 confirmation hearing for appellate judge, will revisit whether Kavanaugh misled or lied to them about his involvement in the Bush-era debate over the legal treatment of detainees. And without Al Franken around to get worked up and inspire a thousand blog posts to bloom, expect Cory Booker and Kamala Harris to take up the mantle of viral outrage (that can be used in their presidential campaigns).
        
          Even with all of these rich policy areas, though, the procedural issue of limited access to documents still seems to be at the forefront of Democrats’ minds. Recognizing the slim odds they have of stopping Kavanaugh, they’ve worked to label the entire process as a corrupt power grab.
        
          Of the 430,000 documents that George W. Bush’s review team has submitted to the committee, 267,000, as of Friday, had been made available for public consumption while the others remained committee-confidential. (President Trump claimed executive privilege over another roughly 100,000, in what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, bless his heart, dubbed the “Friday night document massacre.”) One of the final stages of the document drama heading into the hearing, then, has been whether Democratic senators could refer to committee-confidential documents in an open hearing. Grassley, in a letter to committee members on Aug. 22, gave senators until Aug. 28 to flag which confidential documents they might want to use so that his staff could ask Presidents Donald Trump and George W. Bush to waive the remaining confidentiality restrictions on them. According to Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy, only one senator took them up on the offer. But Democrats had a reasonable excuse for rejecting it: They didn’t want to tip off Grassley, and thus Kavanaugh, to their lines of inquiry ahead of the hearing.
        
          I can’t think of a more appropriately slapstick escalation of the documents saga than this. In a process during which many members of each side superficially pretend to maintain an open mind about a consequential nominee’s acumen and ability to apply the law, we enter the confirmation hearings with a dispute about whether the chairman is trying to rat out the minority party.

Everything that we’ve seen, and will see, flows from that.
