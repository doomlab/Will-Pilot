"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/06/691870683/7-takeaways-from-president-trumps-state-of-the-union-address","President Trump delivered a wide-ranging State of the Union address Tuesday night that went an hour and 21 minutes. That's the third-longest ever. So what should we make of Trump's third address to Congress, and in a year when Democrats are gearing up for a crowded primary to decide who will face Trump in 2020?1. Trump did not acknowledge the new political reality in WashingtonEach of the past four presidents, including Trump, had lost the House at some point during their presidency. And every one of them that came before Trump — Bill Clinton in 1995, George W. Bush in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2011 — nodded to that change. Not Trump. Instead, he barreled ahead with pitching his agenda.2. The speech was like whiplashThe president had some bipartisan overtures — talking about a recently enacted criminal justice law, paid family leave, lowering prescription drug costs and dangling, once again, infrastructure.But the speech went from optimistic vagueries (""Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead"") to misleading fears (calling a new caravan of Central American immigrants a ""tremendous onslaught"" and describing the Southern U.S. border as ""very dangerous"" and ""lawless."" NPR fact-checked the claims here.)And Trump even fired this warning shot at Democrats about whether anything will get done: ""If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., took that as a threat, saying in a statement after the speech: ""[H]e threatened the United States Congress not to exercise its constitutional responsibility of oversight.""3. There was news on North KoreaThe only real bit of news in the speech was that Trump announced he would be meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a second summit Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam. But the president also raised eyebrows, claiming that if he hadn't been elected, ""we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.""Oddly, Trump both overstates (""major war"" potential) and understates (it hasn't denuclearized) the threat posed by North Korea.4. There wasn't any progress on avoiding another shutdownThe president spent a good chunk of the speech on immigration. He argued in favor of a wall: ""Simply put, walls work, and walls save lives.""And he did not seem like someone ready to negotiate on a wall or border security funding to avoid a shutdown. ""My administration has sent to Congress a common sense proposal to end the crisis on the Southern border,"" Trump said. ""It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built.""Trump also did not mention federal workers or the government shutdown in the speech. So it appears, unless something drastic changes, the country is headed for either another partial shutdown or the president will declare a national emergency.5. He's running; Trump's speech was aimed at creating a choice between himself and DemocratsBig sections of the speech felt like 2020 messaging. He was reinforcing his base, not just in talking about immigration, but he also denounced abortion in some of his strongest language (using the word ""execute,"" for example). It was also strongly pro-Israel and stressed national security.When he talked about Venezuela, he used it as an opportunity to tie it back to a criticism of Democrats domestically: ""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.""Trump's speech was billed as one of unity, but he subtly inserted campaign slogans and created a binary choice between him and Democrats, between ""greatness"" and ""resistance.""""We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction,"" Trump said early on in his address. ""Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.""He came back to that theme at the end with another campaign theme: ""I am asking you to choose greatness ... we must keep America first in our hearts.""6. Democratic women were a show of forceOne of the moments of levity in the speech was when Trump noted: ""No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.""That prompted Democratic women, clad in white outfits in honor of suffragettes, to let out a Bronx cheer. After all, women were a major reason why Democrats took back the House last year. The irony seemed lost on the president, who remarked, ""You weren't supposed to do that.""Trump then noted, ""We also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.""But that is entirely because of Democratic women. The numbers of Republican women in Congress actually went down after the 2018 elections.7. Stacey Abrams fared pretty wellDelivering the response to the State of the Union has been a tough task over the years, but Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams held up. There was no awkward walk down stairs, no desperate reaches for water and no fumbles. She made her case, slammed Trump over the recent partial shutdown and even said she didn't hope for his failure.The bottom line is Abrams, who narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018, did nothing to dissuade Democrats from wanting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Georgia in 2020."

And it may have the longer-term impact of making it more difficult to bring new people into the government.  ""I think this is just going to further kill morale,"" says Jared Hautamaki, an attorney at the Environmental Protection Agency. ""It's going to hurt recruiting."" Hautamaki, who has worked for the EPA for 10 years, says he has had enough.""Federal employees are demonized by Congress and industry and the public.  It's just not a good place to be,"" he says.In its annual study of the ""Best Places to Work in the Federal Government,"" the Partnership for Public Service found that federal workforce morale was already on the decline for a number of reasons. The Trump administration instituted a temporary hiring freeze and then a pay freeze. Now, after the second partial government shutdown in a year, Partnership CEO Max Stier says working for a federal agency feels even less rewarding, especially for those workers with a sense of mission.""I think that is what's most troubling for the federal workforce,"" Stier says.  ""Yes, it had real financial implications, but even more than that, it disrupted the core value proposition of the job, which is to be able to make a difference, to work for a purpose.""Michelle Cloutier, a federal worker in Washington, D.C., described getting over a ""furlough hangover"" when the government finally reopened. Cloutier, a military veteran, does not plan to leave the government, saying her current job ""is another way to serve my country,"" but she added, ""I don't like the uncertainty."" In a tight job market, federal employees, many of whom are highly educated, would most likely not have a hard time finding other jobs. Jessica Klement, vice president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, says the effects of the shutdown on federal workers are likely to be long-lasting. ""Federal employees,"" she says, ""take great pride in the work that they do for the federal government. And every day for 35 days they turned on the television and were told, 'You have nothing to worry about — you're going to get back pay' or 'Are you even essential if you're not working during this government shutdown?' "" That message, Klement says, will create ""untold morale problems"" that will play out over the next few ""days, weeks and years.""A recent survey that looked at satisfaction with the federal government's performance by the American Customer Satisfaction Index already showed a slight decline, even before the latest shutdown.Don't see the graphic above? Click here One area where the impact will be felt into the future is in recruitment. The federal workforce is already aging. Stier says that among federal information technology workers, there are ""five times as many people over the age of 60 as under the age of 30."" The federal workforce needs refreshing, says Stier, ""and this is a very bad time to be chasing away new talent that might want to come into government.""Don't see the graphic above? Click here Klement agrees. ""The federal government already has a recruitment problem, right? If you are 22, 23, graduating from college this coming spring,"" she says, ""and you watch this play out for the last 35 days, are you saying to yourself, 'Sign me up for that?' Probably not.""Cloutier says morale at the agency where she works would be better if there weren't the threat of another shutdown later in February.NPR Kroc Fellow Rebecca Ellis contributed to this story."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689356484/government-shutdown-cut-into-economic-growth-cbo-says","Updated at 5 p.m. ETThe partial shutdown of the government reduced federal spending by about $3 billion and cut into overall U.S. economic growth, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.The report says that because of the shutdown, which lasted from Dec. 22 through last Friday, about $18 billion in discretionary government spending was delayed. Most of the money will be spent later, now that the shutdown has ended.As a result, the nation's gross domestic product will be about 0.2 percentage points lower for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 0.4 percentage points lower during the first quarter of 2019 than it would have been, although part of that will be recouped later in the year. The official report on gross domestic product is released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and was due out on Wednesday. However, the shutdown has delayed the release of this report, for the fourth quarter of 2018, the agency said Monday. The GDP report is one of the ways economists get a handle on how the economy is doing, and it may come out next week, according to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.In the meantime, Congress' watchdog on economic data, the CBO, had estimated that first-quarter growth to be an annualized 2.5 percent. Now, with the shutdown's effects, the agency is estimating growth to be at 2.1 percent.  The CBO report does not attempt to quantify the secondary effects of the shutdown on private sector businesses but called them ""significant.""""For example, some businesses could not obtain federal permits and certifications, and others faced reduced access to loans provided by the federal government. Such factors were probably beginning to lead firms to postpone investment and hiring decisions,"" the report says.Some of the affected private sector businesses will never recoup the income they lost, CBO said.The agency's experts left room for ""considerable uncertainty"" about the shutdown's economic impact.""In particular, CBO is uncertain about how much discretionary spending was affected by the partial shutdown, how affected federal employees and contractors adjusted their spending in response to delayed compensation, and how agencies will adjust their spending on goods and services now that funding has resumed,"" it said. However, the Trump administration's Kudlow took issue with the report, insisting that there was ""certainly no permanent damage to the economy.""""We frequently disagree with CBO, with all respect. They're doing the best job they can. I get that.  No, I won't acknowledge any of that right now. In a $20 trillion economy, it's awfully hard to make even the best guesstimates of those kinds of small fractions of numbers. That's what you're looking [at] here. Let's see how it rolls out,"" said Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council.The CBO report came as federal employees were beginning to return to work following Friday's agreement between President Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations continue over border security.Democrats said the CBO report should serve as a warning to Trump not to shut down the government again.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump should ""swiftly sign"" legislation to prevent another shutdown.""The President's shutdown inflicted needless pain and chaos in the lives of millions of Americans, and stole billions of dollars from the economy. Workers' financial security, families' well-being and America's economic strength all were senselessly sacrificed because of President Trump's callousness,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Families across the nation are still trying to recover from a month of missing paychecks and overdue bills, but the President is already threatening a second shutdown if he doesn't get his way,"" Pelosi added.""The CBO confirms that the Trump shutdown had a debilitating effect on our entire economy, and if it were to resume in three weeks, millions of Americans would again share the pain of the 800,000 workers who spent the past month without a paycheck,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., chairman of the House Budget Committee. "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/28/689237309/census-bureau-conducts-massive-recruiting-effort-for-2020-head-count","While hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the partial government shutdown, one federal agency was in the midst of a massive recruiting effort.The Census Bureau has been busy trying to hire around a half million temporary workers to help carry out the upcoming national head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially kick off next January.Funding carried over from last year kept census preparations going through the 35-day shutdown that ended Jan. 25. That includes processing applications received through the bureau's 2020 census jobs website that launched last September and staffing up census offices that are starting to open this month in communities around the country.""The one thing that keeps me up at night is the one thing I have less control over, and that's our ability to recruit and hire,"" the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, explained during a public meeting last year.Census workers will play a critical role to make sure people who don't fill out a census form themselves by mail, phone or online get counted. Fewer than seven in 10 householders plan to take part in the census, according to a new report commissioned by the Census Bureau.""The rate is cause for concern because the decennial census is designed to count every person in the United States,"" wrote the report's researchers, noting that the actual response rate may be lower.A small applicant pool?Door-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion. But the visits have helped the agency ensure that as many residents in the U.S. as possible are counted accurately and at their usual addresses.The low unemployment rate, however, could result in an applicant pool smaller than the bureau would like for its openings for door knockers and other census positions.An earlier round of hiring beginning in 2016 for partnership specialists — charged with encouraging the hardest-to-count groups, including communities of color, to participate in the census — encountered ""smaller than expected applicant pools, declined offers, and turnover,"" according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.For last year's test run of the 2020 census in Rhode Island's Providence County, the bureau sent out into the field about 70 percent of the workers it planned to bring on. Using smartphones to submit people's census information back to the bureau through the Internet did help boost the workers' productivity for the test run in Providence County. Still, Census Bureau officials say they plan to adapt their recruiting efforts for the actual head count. Only hiring U.S. citizens?More than 90,000 people have applied for 2020 census jobs through the bureau's website, and since late December, the agency has hired more than 680 workers. The bureau is expected to make a more high-profile push for job applicants through an advertising campaign set to launch in January 2020.Census job postings have noted that U.S. citizenship is a requirement, as it is for most federal government positions. For past head counts, however, the Census Bureau has received exemptions to hire noncitizens with special language or cultural skills to serve as translators and in outreach positions.""There is not a ban"" on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June. In a new statement, the agency says it's ""still pursuing all legal flexibilities provided by Congress to hire the workforce we will need to conduct an accurate 2020 Census."" So far, however, the bureau has only hired U.S. citizens for the upcoming head count.""Bridge job""Some communities are doing their part in recruiting efforts by helping job seekers apply for census jobs. For now, many of the openings are for outreach specialists who work with local community groups, as well as for positions based in local and regional census offices.Marzena Ermler, the career services manager at the New York Public Library, says she has been recommending census positions as a ""bridge job"" for some job seekers.""We very often see a lot of mature job seekers who are transitioning from one career to another,"" explains Ermler, who is based at the Science, Industry and Business Library in Manhattan. ""They, for whatever reason, are laid off, other jobs are over, and they need that quick access to cash.""Pamela Hudson recently stopped by the Bronx Library Center to meet with a career coach who helped her complete an online job application for a supervisor position. Communities like the Bronx, she says, need to be counted accurately so that they get their fair share of the hundreds of billions of federal tax dollars distributed based on census numbers.""I'm thinking about transitioning into this job because it's very important to me,"" Hudson adds. ""We have children that need education. We have children that need health care.""Concerns about census fundingThe partial government shutdown, however, did give Hudson pause about working for the Census Bureau. She noticed the bureau was not updating portions of its website during the shutdown because of ""a lapse in federal funding,"" according to a banner splashed across the site.""I'm concerned about that,"" Hudson says, wondering if census workers may not get paid if there's another funding stalemate. In case there's another shutdown in the coming weeks, the bureau has said it has enough money to work on the 2020 census into April.Whatever happens, Tayesha Hudson, no relation to Pamela, says she is not worried.""I know eventually the government is going to have to get it together, and I know that they're going to want this 2020 census to go forward,"" she says.Tayesha Hudson is interested in helping with door-knocking and collecting census information in the Bronx. If she is hired for the job, though, she expects to do a lot of persuading of community members who, she says, may not see the point of participating in the census. ""It's about making sure that we get the things that we need in our community, that everybody is counted regardless of their race, regardless of whether or not they're a citizen,"" she says. ""We're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.""The challenge of the citizenship questionThe controversy over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to the 2020 census could pose another challenge to recruiting and hiring. The question asks, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""A federal judge in New York, who presided over the two lead lawsuits about the question, has ordered the administration to stop plans to include it on forms for the head count. But the administration – which is facing five other citizenship question lawsuits — wants the Supreme Court to let the question stay.If it does, many census workers will have a harder job, says Elzie Wright, a program coordinator for the Christopher Rose Community Empowerment Campaign, based in Brooklyn.""They know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment,"" explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn. ""Let's face it: There's a lot of undocumented people in the community. And that makes them suspicious to talk to anybody.""The Census Bureau is expecting fewer households to respond to the census if there is a citizenship question. It plans to use results from an upcoming field test of people's responses to the question to update its recruiting strategy as the head count draws closer.That means the bureau could have to hire even more workers."

Philadelphia International Airport also saw slight staffing-related delays.The staffing problems took place against the backdrop of the 35th day of the partial government shutdown, which President Trump announced Friday would come to an end with a three-week stopgap funding measure.Airlines for America, a trade group representing the commercial airline industry, praised the reopening of the government.""As we have seen over the past 35 days, the pressures and strains of a shutdown are not sustainable; the disruptions to passengers, commerce and the economy are not tolerable,"" Airlines for America President and CEO Nicholas Calio said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""We urge elected leaders to continue working together to identify a solution that will keep the government open beyond February 15 and will continue paying the dedicated federal employees.""LaGuardia attributed the problem to a shortage of workers ""at FAA air traffic control centers along the East Coast."" Flights originating from other airports were affected Friday morning as the FAA sought to control the pace of planes arriving at LaGuardia. Some of those flights were delayed by an average of 1 hour and 26 minutes.""We have experienced a slight increase in sick leave at two facilities,"" the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. ""We've mitigated the impact by augmenting staffing, rerouting traffic, and increasing spacing between aircraft when needed. The results have been minimal impacts to efficiency while maintaining consistent levels of safety in the national airspace system.""Delta said 200 of its flights were affected by the delays. Travelers can monitor can air traffic delays on a map at the FAA's website. The FAA suggested travelers check with airline carriers for more information.The White House said officials were keeping an eye on the delays.""The President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Friday morning. ""We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA.""The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents 20,000 air traffic controllers and other aviation safety workers, said in a statement Friday that it ""does not condone or endorse any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively affects the capacity of the National Airspace System."" Because of the interconnectedness of that system, it said, delays at one major facility can cause far-reaching ripple effects.""Air traffic controllers take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public at all costs very seriously. Nothing else matters except safety,"" NATCA President Paul Rinaldi said in the statement. ""[I]n the past few weeks, we have warned about what could happen as a result of the prolonged shutdown. Many controllers have reached the breaking point of exhaustion, stress and worry caused by this shutdown. Each hour that goes by that the shutdown continues makes the situation worse."" There is already a 30-year low in fully certified air traffic controllers, he added.As the government shutdown has stretched on, many air traffic controllers and transportation security officers have been working without pay. ""And when your job is to do something like separate aircraft safely in the sky over a crowded city, those are not the folks you want who are distracted by what is really a preventable stressor,"" Erin Bowen, an expert in aviation psychology at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told NPR.NPR transportation reporter David Schaper contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688414503/watch-live-trump-addresses-shutdown-from-white-house-rose-garden","Updated at 9:45 p.m. ETThe longest government shutdown in history ended after President Trump signed a bipartisan three-week stopgap funding measure late Friday. Several agencies had been partially shuttered for 35 days.""I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the White House Rose Garden, announcing the long-awaited bipartisan breakthrough.By Friday evening, the House and Senate had unanimously passed the bill to fund the government through Feb. 15. Lawmakers also authorized moving forward on a longer-term Department of Homeland Security funding bill for the rest of the fiscal year, where border security funds can be negotiated on a bipartisan basis. The question remains, however, what exactly Trump accomplished with his firm stance against any deal without funding for a border wall, which he eventually capitulated to.The stopgap measure does not include funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump has pushed for. The Homeland Security bill does not include money earmarked for a wall, either, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers will hammer out the details over the next few weeks.Ultimately, as the president's approval ratings tumbled and polls showed the public largely blamed Republicans for the increasingly dire situation — punctuated on Friday by massive delays at major airports and recent warnings about a threat to national security — Trump finally seemed to back down from his demands. At least for now.Another shutdown looming in three weeks?Trump seemed to revive earlier deal-breakers as he ended his speech, warning that if negotiations over the next three weeks don't result in funding for the ""powerful wall or steel barrier"" he has demanded, ""the government would either shut down again"" or he would declare a national emergency to build the wall. ""I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary,"" Trump teased at the beginning of his remarks about the extreme measures — which would very likely face legal challenges in court. ""We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shiny sea,"" the president added, showing an openness to some technology efforts that some Democrats have signaled they could back. Still, he reiterated proposals to build barriers in specific areas identified by the Border Patrol, strengthen security at legal ports of entry and provide humanitarian assistance to those who have crossed the border. ""Walls or barriers or whatever you want to call it will be an important part of the solution,"" said Trump, who has regularly contradicted himself on how he describes the promised wall.Trump insisted later Friday evening on Twitter that the deal ""was in no way a concession.""Democrats take a victory lapTrump and Republicans had long maintained any deal to end the shutdown must include funding for the border wall the president wants, which was his key promise during the 2016 campaign. But Democrats said they should reopen the government and then resume talks, which is exactly what Friday's deal does. Democratic leaders argued their conference's unity is what eventually caused Trump to cave. ""The American people do not like it when you throw a wrench into the lives of government workers over an unrelated political dispute,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters. ""Hopefully now the president has learned his lesson.""The first signs of a crack in Trump's resolve came earlier this week. After House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said he could not give the State of the Union address until after the shutdown, Trump threatened to hold the annual speech someplace else. But he backed down hours later and said he would defer to Pelosi.  It's unclear when the State of the Union, which had been slated for next Tuesday, will happen following Friday's deal to end the shutdown. Pelosi told reporters that it is ""not planned now"" and that she had told Trump ""when the government is opened we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.""Pelosi, a veteran appropriator, said she was hopeful the three-week talks would produce a deal on border security, though she didn't answer a question about whether that may include any funding for even portions of a wall. She has repeatedly said she is opposed to a wall and has called it ""immoral."" ""I see every challenge or every crisis as an opportunity,"" Pelosi said.Speaking on the Senate floor shortly after Trump endorsed the deal, McConnell said he too was optimistic, but with some caveats.""Going forward, I hope Democrats will stay true to the commitment they have stated constantly over the past weeks — that once government was reopened, they would be perfectly willing to negotiate in good faith on full-year government funding that would include a significant investment in urgently needed border security measures, including physical barriers,"" McConnell said.Consequences of the prolonged shutdownFederal employees who have been working without pay or are furloughed would also get back pay as part of the agreement, though it's unclear how long that might take. The American Federation of Government Employees says workers could get back pay as soon as next Thursday, but the union says it is also possible they won't get paid until their next scheduled pay date during the week of Feb. 4.A senior administration official says ""the administration is taking steps to ensure that they receive pay as soon as possible.""Federal contractors also impacted by the shutdown would not get any back pay. The breakthrough comes as federal workers missed their second paycheck in a row, now going without their salaries for more than a month. Trump thanked those workers, calling them ""patriots"" and said they have ""suffered"" far greater than anyone but they and their families can understand. The prolonged stalemate pushed the nation's security and infrastructure to the brink, with significant flight delays at major airports due to Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration absences escalating on Friday. The FBI also warned that critical crime-fighting measures have been curtailed with its agents limited and working without pay.How it beganThe shutdown began on Dec. 22, when Republicans still had control of a lame-duck Congress following their loss of 40 seats in the House in November 2018. After two years of unified control, the GOP president was unable to push through Trump's signature campaign promise — which he repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for — and there seemed to be an urgency to his last push. Egged on by conservative media and pundits, Trump drew a line — until he didn't.Schumer said the lesson Trump should take away from the quagmire is that Pelosi, who reclaimed the speaker's gavel at the beginning of January, should not be taken lightly. ""No one should ever underestimate the speaker, as Donald Trump has learned,"" Schumer said.NPR congressional correspondents Susan Davis and Kelsey Snell and NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre contributed to this report.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/24/688246216/for-people-who-need-assistance-the-lingering-shutdown-could-mean-a-food-crisis","The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has some of the country's poorest residents worried about how they are going to stay fed.In Pennsylvania, no place has more trouble keeping food on the table than the city of Reading, population 88,000, about an hour outside Philadelphia. Nearly half of all households there receive food stamps, the highest rate in the state.The human toll of that statistic can be found everywhere, including among the people lining up for a monthly food pantry operated by St. James Chapel Church of God.That's where Janelle Rosado waits. She receives about $300 a month in food stamps loaded on a government-issued debit card to help feed herself and her three kids at home, but she still struggles to provide for her family.""SNAP is all we know""Like everyone else in the line of about two dozen people, Rosado is quick to talk about the subject on her mind: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.""To a lot of us, SNAP is all we know,"" said Rosado, 41. ""And that's the horrible truth, but it's the truth. Like, I've never been without SNAP.""Unless the longest government shutdown in U.S. history soon ends with a deal to reopen the government, Rosado is about to experience life without SNAP. Federal officials say SNAP funding to states has now been thrown into limbo, with the nation's 38 million recipients expected to start feeling pressure as soon as next month.Like many others in Pennsylvania's poorest communities, Rosado is bracing herself for what might soon be a new reality.""What I did is stock my freezer with as much meat as I could, look for the best deals, like even the cheapest cans,"" she said.Rosado used to work in cosmetology but lost her job years ago. Since then, she has taken temporary gigs around Reading and has been applying for full-time work, but she said it has been hard to come by.Rosado has a lot of company in Reading, formerly a railroad and manufacturing boomtown that, over the decades, has experienced the painful effects of deindustrialization.Federal figures show that today about 44 percent of households in Reading receive food stamps, making it one of the highest rates in the nation.Inside the St. James Chapel Church of God, Marilyn Ray sits at a table as a volunteer, checking in people who come for bags of food.Retired and living on a fixed income, Ray is worried about her own adult daughter, who lives with her and uses SNAP benefits. If the shutdown drags on Ray is afraid the pantry's lines will surge so much that they might deplete food supplies.""I may get a person that's one single person, but the very next person in line may be a mother with six children,"" says Ray, 72. ""How do I serve them with nothing to serve them?""A SNAP crisis in FebruaryIn the state capital of Harrisburg, the same question is being raised by Teresa Miller, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services. ""I've been anticipating that mid-February is when we might see the SNAP crisis,"" Miller said.The federal government told Miller food stamps would have funding through February, but next month's benefits were distributed early, which Miller said could pose a big problem.State officials mailed recipients letters informing them about this payment adjustment, but Miller said the letters may have puzzled some people.""We know that recipients who experience food insecurity are probably going to have greater challenges and confusion during this government shutdown,"" Miller said. ""They don't know what's going on and they're not sure why they're getting payments on these off days.""She had hoped people would budget the benefits for two months, but early data suggest that is not happening. Instead, she said, state figures tracking SNAP recipients show that they are spending twice as much.That means, starting in February, nearly 2 million Pennsylvania residents may be without food assistance. Miller said there's no way the state can cover the gap.""It's hundreds of millions of dollars a month in SNAP benefits. This is a lot of money that goes out the door. The state is not going to be able to step in and pay that kind of money in place of the federal government,"" she said.Shutdown paralysisIt is unclear when the partial government shutdown, now in its 34th day, will be resolved, as Democrats in Washington and President Trump remain at odds over billions of dollars in funding for expanding a wall along the nation's Southwest border.Lowman Henry, with the Harrisburg-based Lincoln Institute of Public Opinion & Research, favors Trump's side of the debate. He says supporters of the proposed border wall understand that the shutdown may require short-term pain for many Americans.""Yes, it is very unfortunate that there are innocent people caught in the crossfire,"" Lowman said. ""But they do need to look to Washington and put pressure on their elected officials to come to the table and seriously negotiate to deal with the humanitarian crisis on the Southern border.""Food supplies dwindlingAs the standoff continues, the Greater Berks Food Bank, which distributes some 7 million pounds of food each year to hungry households in the region, is worried about its supply.""Without a doubt, this could make a tremendous impact on the inventory that we have here,"" said Doug Long, a spokesman with the food bank. ""These families really are stuck in the middle and potentially can be suffering quite soon here as a direct result of the shutdown.""The USDA says it is examining all options in trying to come up with an emergency plan. The agency reportedly has around $3 billion in a contingency fund — but providing benefits to the country for just one month costs around $5 billion.All the crisis planning around feeding the country's most in-need people has St. James pastor Steven McCracken feeling troubled.""Apprehensive, concerned, angry,"" McCracken said. ""Honestly, there's no reason for this. There shouldn't be a government shutdown. And this long is just ridiculous to me. Because the people who need it most are the people who suffer the most.""Ray, the food bank volunteer, said she does not understand the need for the political drama. ""From a mother's standpoint, I'd like to go to Washington and tell them to stop acting like a bunch of spoiled brats,"" she said. ""To me, it seems like, 'If I can't have what I want, I'm going to stomp my feet and hold my breath until you give it to me,' and that's exactly what's going on.""A retired insurance worker, Ray grew up in Reading with a father who worked in steel factories and a mother who worked in dry cleaning. Life was sometimes paycheck to paycheck, and that experience has brought her a greater sense of dignity in wanting to help families who struggle to make ends meet.Ray says Washington would function better if politicians had a better understanding of places like Reading.""We don't have people paying a whole bunch of dollars in taxes. We don't have people who have these great big jobs and are bringing in the money and had the voice out there to speak or to protest whatever it is,"" Ray said. ""So we're forgotten about.""This story comes from Keystone Crossroads, a statewide public media initiative reporting on cities across Pennsylvania. "

""But the idea that it's 'paycheck or zero' is not a really valid idea.""Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced what she called a ""let them eat cake"" attitude from the commerce secretary, whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at nearly $700 million.""They just don't understand why people have to stand in food lines,"" Pelosi said.Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., whose district is home to many unpaid federal workers, invited the commerce secretary to join her at a food bank this weekend.""I think it would be a valuable learning experience for you to see what our federal workforce, including your own employees at the Department of Commerce, are going through,"" Wexton wrote in a letter to Ross.The 800,000 government employees have been furloughed or working without pay since Dec. 22, thanks to a stalemate over President Trump's demand for a $5.7 billion border wall.Trump defended his commerce secretary, suggesting that local grocers, bankers and landlords would make accommodations for cash-strapped federal workers during the partial shutdown. ""I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant,"" he said, although he conceded that ""perhaps he should have said it differently.""Complaints from federal workers have been growing as the shutdown drags into its second month. The FBI Agents Association says its members are less effective at fighting crime; the Coast Guard says asking its personnel to serve without pay is ""unacceptable""; and air traffic controllers say they're worried about basic flight safety.Ross stressed on Thursday that workers are certain to receive back pay once Congress restores funding to the agencies for which appropriations have lapsed. ""So the 30 days of pay that some people will be out — there's no real reason why they shouldn't be able to get a loan against it,"" he said.Ross also minimized the broader economic fallout from the shutdown.""While I feel sorry for the individuals that have hardship cases, 800,000 workers, if they never got their pay — which is not the case — they will eventually get it — but if they never got it, you're talking about a third of a percent on our GDP,"" Ross said. ""So it's not like it's a gigantic number overall.""White House economist Kevin Hassett warned on Wednesday that if the shutdown continued through March, it could erase economic growth in the first quarter."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/24/688151634/trump-backs-down-but-will-he-make-a-deal","In this game of who would blink first in this shutdown showdown, it was, perhaps surprisingly, President Trump.Late Wednesday night, the president tweeted saying he would defer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and not deliver a State of the Union address until the government is back open.It was a remarkable concession from this president, who at nearly every turn since he's been on the national stage has not backed down. It comes on a day that the Senate is voting on two measures that were expected to fail as soon as they were introduced — Trump's proposal made in a speech on Saturday for $5.7 billion in border wall funding for temporary protections for immigrants and a Democratic bill that would open the government for a few weeks as negotiations continue on border security.Trump's concession could signal an openness to getting the government back open, especially as Democrats show no sign of giving in on the wall and as the shutdown takes a political toll on this president.Democrats are poised to offer a counterproposal of a significant purse of money for border security. That will not include money for a wall, but there's talk of a ""smart wall"" — a new framing alluding to the president's demand — with technology and manpower that Democrats are willing to fund.Pelosi and other Democrats were saying Wednesday that they felt they had to ""hold the line"" against wall funding in the midst of a shutdown, so as to not encourage Trump to try it again. After all, most estimates put the cost of a wall along the entire border at far higher than $5.7 billion.Instead of arguing over the specifics of border security, which some Democrats disagree on — including freshmen who delivered the party a majority by flipping swing districts in 2018 — Pelosi has held her caucus together by focusing on the president's tactics, which they all can oppose.""There is serious and justified concern that this president would shut down the government any time he does not get his way legislatively,"" Pelosi said Wednesday. ""That is why we must hold the line on this shutdown.""The next question is how the White House will respond to the Democrats' offer, since Trump has stopped negotiating to end the shutdown. In recent days he has been talking solely with Republicans, didn't consult with Democrats before his speech Saturday to see if elements of what he was proposing would be acceptable, and he has been lobbying Republicans to vote for his legislation.But what happens when not only his legislation fails, but if some Republicans vote in favor of the Democratic bill? What then? Does he retrench?Mercedes Schlapp, a White House spokeswoman, notably did not mention the wall when asked by NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition Thursday if the president could accept, for example, $5.7 billion for border security, but not for a wall.""Well, why don't we have the Democrats come over and propose that over to the president?"" Schlapp said.A trio of polls out Wednesday showed bad news for the president. Majorities are blaming him for the shutdown, and his approval rating is suffering. The most dramatic result was from The Associated Press and NORC, which showed Trump's approval rating at a low for his presidency in that poll: 34 percent, down from 42 percent last month. Two-thirds of people said they disapproved of the job he's doing. That included a whopping 69 percent of independents.A CBS news poll found that 71 percent of Americans do not think a border wall is worth a government shutdown. And a Fox News poll found three-quarters of Americans think the shutdown is an emergency or major problem, higher than the number who say that about the situation at the border.It's easy to dismiss one poll or cherry pick from another, but it's almost impossible to not notice when a confluence of polling is all saying essentially the same thing.Undoubtedly, the polls are on Democrats' side right now, but they also have to be wary of going too far. While more people in the CBS poll said they think Trump should compromise, a majority also believes Democrats should accept a budget with at least some wall funding.It is a sign that ""no"" will probably not be an acceptable answer for long. Democrats knew that after Trump made his speech and proposal Saturday — and now are prepared to make their counteroffer.As the political pressure grows, it seems there could be, for the first time since this longest partial shutdown in U.S. history began in December, a light at the end of the tunnel.There is an opening, but the reality remains that no one, even those close to this president in the White House and his administration, knows exactly what he would sign off on."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/24/688147596/democrats-to-offer-deal-on-border-to-end-shutdown","Updated at 9 p.m. ETAfter an at-times heated debate, the Senate on Thursday, as expected, failed to approve either of the competing measures that would have ended the standoff over border wall funding.If nothing else, the votes seemed to spur a flurry of efforts to find a way to end the standoff. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced on the Senate floor after the measures failed that he spoke with President Trump about a three-week stopgap bill to reopen the government.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., met to discuss the proposal. But later Thursday evening, a spokesman for Schumer said, ""Sen. Schumer and Senate Democrats have made clear to Leader McConnell and Republicans that they will not support funding for the wall, prorated or otherwise."" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying that the White House had already made it clear to Graham that a three-week bill ""would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall.""""It depends""Speaking to journalists Thursday evening from the White House during an event about trade, Trump said he was open to a compromise with Democrats that reopens the government if it includes a ""prorated down payment"" on the border wall that has been the sticking point in the ongoing funding impasse. But no breakthrough appeared to be imminent, based on the president's comments.The president said he is open to whatever results from the discussions between McConnell and Schumer, but Trump would not commit beyond a broad statement to assess what the Senate leaders announce.""It depends on what the agreement is,"" the president said. ""If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support it.""Trump also restated how important he thought a permanent barrier on the Mexico border is to prevent what he called the smuggling of drugs and humans through ""wide open spaces"" where no such barrier stands now. He acknowledged that much of the contraband smuggled into the United States arrives at major ports of entry, but he said, ""The big stuff comes through the areas where you have nobody watching.""Dueling proposals failDespite Trump's apparent willingness to entertain a short-term deal that would reopen the government, Democrats in Congress have been resistant to supporting any funding that would go toward construction of a wall or other barrier on the border with Mexico.The Senate votes followed by a renewed effort to find a deal came on Day 34 of the partial government shutdown, which has left some 800,000 federal employees without their second straight paycheck — which many would have received Friday. The first vote, on a proposal by Trump to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall as well as changes in immigration law, received 50 votes in favor, with 47 senators voting against it. Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas voted against the GOP measure while Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor.The second proposal, sponsored by Senate Democrats, would have provided for two weeks of operating money for the government but included no funds for a wall while discussions on border security continued. It received 52 votes in its favor, and 44 senators opposed it. Six GOP senators supported the Democratic bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Cory Gardner of Colorado.Both measures needed 60 votes to advance.As a group of freshman House Democrats visiting the Senate chamber looked on earlier Thursday, tempers rose during the Senate debate. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., lashed out at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who instigated a previous shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, during the Obama administration.With his arms crossed, Bennet accused Cruz of ""crying crocodile tears"" over the current lack of funding for first responders, including the Coast Guard. ""When the senator from Texas shut this government down in 2013, my state was flooded,"" Bennet said.""It was underwater!"" Bennet continued. ""People were killed! People's houses were destroyed! Their small businesses were ruined forever! And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down for politics.""The negotiationsEarlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., threw cold water on reports that Democrats were working on a deal to fund border security but not a wall.  At a Thursday morning news conference, she said Democrats were not engaging in behind-the-scenes planning of an offer.She said Democrats are working on the regular appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, which could contain additional money for border security.Top Democrats and their aides had told reporters about a proposal that would outline the mutual border security priorities for Trump and members of Congress but would include no new funding for any wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., declined to offer specifics about what is being worked out by Pelosi and the House Homeland Security Committee, but he said Democrats are prepared to make an offer that includes significant new spending on border measures.""We are prepared to spend a very substantial sum of money because we share the view that the border needs to be secure,"" Hoyer said. ""The letter is going to articulate what we believe is an effective investment to accomplish border security."" Trump wants $5.7 billion for the wall, and the Democrats' proposal could exceed that amount.Appearing on NPR's Morning Edition, White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp did not immediately rule the idea out.  ""Why don't we have the Democrats come over and propose that over to the president?"" she said. ""What we need is a conversation.""But it's not clear whether Trump would sign off on the offer.Several conservative leaders who met with Trump on Wednesday to discuss immigration policy and strategy told NPR that the president had resolve and believed the ball was in Pelosi's court.""You don't negotiate against yourself, and that was a clear message,"" said Ken Cuccinelli of the Senate Conservatives Fund. As for a strategy following the failed Senate votes, these conservatives said the White House was looking to peel off or win the support of moderate Democratic House freshmen who were elected last November in traditionally Republican districts. But that has been a White House strategy for more than a week, with few signs of defections. There was no sense coming out of Wednesday's White House meeting that the partial shutdown would end anytime soon. ""We're out of the mentality that this is a sprint,"" said Cuccinelli.Food pantriesRoughly 800,000 federal employees are affected by the shutdown. Many will miss their second paycheck this week. Food pantries have been set up in several cities for the workers.In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said, ""I don't quite understand why"" federal workers are going to food banks, suggesting they apply for loans to make ends meet until they receive back pay.  ""There is really not a good excuse"" for why the affected workers face what Ross termed ""a liquidity crisis.""In his remarks from the White House on Thursday, the president defended Ross though he said he hadn't heard Ross' actual remarks. ""But I do understand perhaps he should have said it differently,"" Trump said.The president continued: ""Local people know who they are, where they go for groceries and everything else, and I think what Wilbur was probably trying to say is they will work along. I know banks are working along, if you have mortgages, the mortgagees, the folks collecting the interest and all of those things, they work along. And that's what happens in time like this. They know the people, they've been dealing with them for years, and they work along — the grocery store — and I think that's probably what Wilbur Ross meant."" ""He's done a great job, I'll tell you that,"" the president also said about his commerce secretary. Pressure to resolve the shutdown also came from an unexpected source: former White House chief of staff and former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. He and four other former DHS secretaries wrote a letter to Congress and the president urging them to end the shutdown.""DHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,"" the former secretaries wrote. ""This is unconscionable."" NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687949428/justice-delayed-is-justice-denied-as-government-shutdown-affects-federal-courts","In federal courts around the nation, the wheels of justice may soon be grinding to a halt.The government shutdown has already caused delays and disruptions throughout the federal court system, and officials are bracing for things to get a lot worse next week.The strain is apparent among lawyers walking in and out of Boston's Federal District Court. Passing in front of famous quotes carved in stone, espousing the importance of a smooth-running system of justice, many attorneys say that ideal is becoming more elusive each day the shutdown drags on.""There is that huge uncertainty, and it will impact our clients' access to justice,"" says Julie Olson, an assistant federal public defender on her way in to meet a client. Public defenders get paid by the courts and have been getting their paychecks, at least so far. But they are ""watching every penny"" and slashing spending, hoping to stretch their funding as long as possible.It is not without challenges, Olson says. It is certainly harder to mount a strong defense when, for example, the expert witnesses you want to hire can't count on getting paid.""Hopefully they will trust it works out in the end,"" she says with a sigh. ""But yeah, we're asking consultants and experts to work on faith.""The problem is even more acute for the pool of private practice defense attorneys who represent indigent clients when public defenders cannot. Because they're independent contractors, the courts stopped paying them — and the experts they hire — when the shutdown first began.  On the other side, prosecutors are also feeling the pinch, both personally, and on their cases. As employees of the Justice Department they've all been working without pay, or have been furloughed, since December.""It's difficult,"" says Lawrence Leiser, president of the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys. ""It's a little demoralizing, and as time goes on, the worse it's going to get.""Civil cases brought by the government, for example for alleged environmental or securities violations, have been stalled. And while the official word is that criminal cases are proceeding uninterrupted, Leiser says that is not quite the case.""As the spigot is turned off, it's beginning to impact our ability to protect the innocent and prosecute the guilty,"" he says. Prosecutors are already running out of money for such basics as DNA testing, paying informants or traveling to interview victims and witnesses, Leiser says, and that is hobbling, for example, even a major investigation of an alleged child predator.""We don't have the funding to conduct investigations and get the bad guys off the street in a timely fashion,"" he says.Ripples from the shutdown of multiple federal agencies are adding to the courts' complications. For example, in the Southern District of New York, District Executive Edward Friedland says staffing constraints in prisons are limiting attorney-client visits, so lawyers are asking the court to postpone hearings.Friedland says his court also recently had to curtail bail hearings because U.S. marshals who transport prisoners are reducing their hours.""We would normally run well into the evening if new arrests come in,"" Friedland says. ""But right now, we're cutting it off at 3 p.m., so if you're brought in after, you won't be processed until the next day, which means you're going to be in jail an extra night.""Such delays are not only costly, but they may also be unconstitutional, says Maine's U.S. District Court Judge Jon Levy. ""The old adage that 'justice delayed is justice denied' is true,"" he says. ""So I think we have to be concerned about challenges regarding the right to a speedy trial that we typically don't face.""Some courts have been taking a hard line against delays, even on civil cases. U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin, from the Southern District of West Virginia, issued an order early in the shutdown, saying ""the government, like all parties, is required to find the means by which to [keep cases on track] regardless of internal issues"" and ""should not be given special ... accommodation ... unavailable to other litigants.""In Boston, U.S. District Court Judge William Young has been even more scathing in denying government requests for delays. ""Lapses in appropriations are ... simply an abdication by the President and Congress ... to govern responsibly,"" he wrote in one order. He goes on to mock the government, comparing it to a corporation that lays off its attorneys and then asks the court for indulgence ""until we get our act together.""The logic, Young writes, ""is laughable."" The government ""cannot delay or deny other litigants their constitutional access to their day in federal court,"" he concludes.Young tells NPR he won't let the shutdown ""change the job I have to do,"" but he acknowledges that calculations will change when the money runs out. ""I honestly don't know,"" he says. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""Meantime, courts are scrambling to come up with contingency plans. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts announced Tuesday that funding that had been expected to run out on Jan. 25 will now extend through Jan. 31, ""thanks to the continued extraordinary efforts"" to cut costs. Courts have been using those savings, plus revenues from court filing fees and some creative accounting, to keep paychecks coming to public defenders, probation officers, interpreters and others, including jurors. But officials make clear that ""no further extensions ... will be possible.""So if the shutdown continues, it enters a whole new phase, where courts could only do work that's constitutionally mandated to protect life, liberty and property. Each court would be left to figure out itself which staff it needs ""to support its mission critical work.""Many are considering draconian measures to triage cases. In the Northern District of Illinois, Chief Judge Ruben Castillo says his next step would be to halt all civil cases. ""So when somebody has some civil rights claim [against the police] or an employment discrimination case involving sexual harassment, all those cases will just come to a grinding stop,"" he says. ""That's basically the sad story. There is a price that this country is going to pay that far surpasses anything anyone realizes.""""It will be a disaster,"" is how Friedland of New York's Southern District sums it up. ""The judicial process will almost come to grinding halt.""He is working around the clock on contingency plans for every detail, large and small. ""I have to go speak to all the delis and local restaurants in town and say, 'We would like to continue to order [jury lunches] from you, but [after the 31st] all I can offer you is an IOU.' "" He also worries whether juror candidates will show up, if the courts no longer pay their $50 daily stipend and reimburse them for travel.He is also looking into a Plan B, in case he can't keep the maintenance crews who keep the courthouse running. Friedland is now dusting off an old doomsday plan, designed years ago during the bird flu scare.""I never thought we'd have to use it for this,"" Friedland says. ""But if in fact the buildings can't stay open, we literally will have judges at their kitchen tables with a laptop computer with a camera on top, looking at a defendant who's sitting at a U.S. marshals' holding cell somewhere, conducting these hearings.""Meantime, many prosecutors and public defenders, like Olson, are vowing to keep working, with or without a paycheck.""We're going to still have to do whatever it is we have to do,"" she says. ""We'll beg, borrow, and ... well, not steal,"" she says, chuckling, before turning serious again. ""Even if I'm not paid, I still can't let my client sit in a prison. It just can't happen. My client's liberty interest comes first.""Still, the prospect of going unpaid does weigh on her.""It's very nerve-wracking,"" she says. ""I'm well into my 40s, and I still have substantial student loans ... that I'm paying off, and living expenses, so the threat is frightening.""Castillo calls it a betrayal of public servants, who are already sacrificing by working for a government salary when they could make more in the private sector. ""It feels like we're on the front lines trying to fight a battle while our own forces are shooting us in the back."" he says.Since the shutdown, he has already seen about 5 percent of his staff retire, or quit, he says. ""I'm losing key people,"" he says. ""What are we doing here?

Earlier in the day, asked about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., insisting he could not speak on the House floor until a partial government shutdown is over, the president said, ""We'll do something in the alternative.""But late in the evening, Trump noted that Pelosi ""changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over.""""[There] is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber,"" the president tweeted. ""I look forward to giving a 'great' State of the Union Address in the near future!""Pelosi was quick to respond in a tweet of her own. ""Mr. President, I hope by saying 'near future' you mean you will support the House-passed package to #EndTheShutdown that the Senate will vote on tomorrow."" The Senate plans to vote on two measures Thursday to end the partial government shutdown; neither is expected to pass.The president and the speaker had traded barbed letters Wednesday, with Trump initially saying he wanted to deliver the speech next Tuesday in the House chamber — the traditional location.""It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!"" Trump wrote, formally accepting an invitation that Pelosi had originally extended on Jan. 3.But Pelosi had rescinded that invitation a week earlier, citing security concerns. She noted that both the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security are unfunded as a result of the ongoing budget standoff.Pelosi suggested Trump postpone the speech until the partial shutdown is over. She also gave the president the option of delivering his message to Congress in writing — a common practice in the 19th century but one that would have denied Trump a major platform on prime-time television.When Trump brushed aside those concerns, Pelosi adopted stronger language.""I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,"" Pelosi wrote in her own letter on Wednesday.The battle of wills over the speech is a microcosm of the larger showdown over Trump's demand for a $5.7 billion border wall, which has shuttered parts of the government for more than a month.Pelosi's stiff-arm left the president looking for an alternative setting from which to address the nation.""The State of the Union has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to hear the truth,"" Trump also told reporters Wednesday.He might have delivered the speech from the White House or from one of the several state capitols where he has been invited.""The American people want to hear the truth,"" Trump said. ""They have to hear the truth.""NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687689976/shutdown-squeezes-irs-workers-just-as-the-tax-filing-season-is-about-to-start","Even in a normal year, taxes can be complicated and stressful — for taxpayers and IRS workers alike. But this year is shaping up to be worse than usual. The IRS starts processing returns on Monday, implementing big changes in tax law while having to run on half the staff because of the ongoing government shutdown.Last week, the IRS ordered about 30,000 furloughed workers back to work without pay. Priscilla Clowers of Orange Park, Fla., resumed training on the new tax code on Friday, so she can answer calls from IRS customers. But she's also fretting about how to pay for her wedding, which is planned for March 30.""I'm sitting here like: 'Oh my God, this can't be happening,' "" she says. "" 'I still gotta get my dress. Oh my God, I got to pay the vendor, the wedding planner, the caterer, and I gotta buy my cake.' ""If she doesn't get paid on Feb. 1, the reception is off, she says.""I haven't even called anybody because it's like somewhere deep down inside of me I got faith in God that something's gonna work out,"" says Clowers, a Navy veteran. She says mounting anxiety makes focusing on the classroom training difficult. ""We're doing a refresher of everything that we previously learned before we left,"" she says. ""I'm trying to get back into the swing of things, but my mind is just on everything that's going on at home.""Many furloughed workers are preoccupied with their financial struggles, says Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 70,000 IRS workers. The union says some workers have been unable to report to work.""How are they going to handle commuting costs, child care costs"" or even buying lunch? he says.So what do all these complexities mean for the 150 million Americans filing individual tax returns and for those expecting refunds?""I don't know how that's going to turn out,"" says Christopher Rizek, a tax attorney and adjunct professor at Georgetown University. ""I think everybody is hopeful, but not a lot of people are optimistic.""He says the shutdown exacerbates a long-standing problem at the understaffed agency. ""There's been a big brain drain at the IRS, particularly at the more senior experienced levels,"" Rizek says. ""Why would someone continue to work for the IRS when they can go work for an accounting firm, do the same work for more money and less stress?""Automated systems might offset some of the burden.Kathy Pickering, executive director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block, notes that 97 percent of taxpayers use software to prepare their returns, and most of them file electronically as well. Those taxpayers have a good shot at seeing their returns processed normally, she says. But that's not the case for forms filed the old-fashioned way. ""Any paper filing is just necessarily going to take longer,"" she says.Also, many taxpayers will see changes to their anticipated refunds because of the new tax law, Pickering says, which will likely result in more calls to the already-jammed IRS hotlines.Some people say taxpayers should feel the pain.Penny Hays, a 35-year veteran IRS worker in Seattle, says she and her husband are living off his disability benefits, but money for food is getting tight. Hays, 59, feels financially pinched from the shutdown and argues taxpayers should, too — if nothing else to demonstrate that IRS workers provide essential services. If they don't, she says, ""it makes the American people feel like there's no nothing going on, there's no big deal, everything's working for them.""Hays says she followed her mother's footsteps in working for the IRS, and at the time, she was proud because the job was secure. But that's no longer the case. She says the effects of the shutdown will linger by making it even harder for the IRS to recruit workers.""It's disheartening, because you see these people walk out the door who have so much job knowledge, and there's nobody coming up through the ranks for me to give my knowledge to,"" Hays says.But at least one new IRS worker, Priscilla Clowers, plans to stick it out. She plans to get married soon and says she hopes she'll get paid in time to have her reception.""But if not, like my fiancé says, all he needs is the preacher and me,"" she says and laughs."

Instead, it features this message at the top of the homepage: Security certificates help keep websites secure, but last week the British security firm Netcraft reported that more than 130 certificates used by U.S. government websites had expired. These certificates make sure users know ""this is really the government resource that I'm trying to access and not some bad guy,"" explains Dan Kaminsky, the chief scientist at the security firm White Ops.The lack of a certificate makes it easier for a bad actor to trick you into going to a fake site. Even though there's a warning when you click on a site without an updated certificate, Kaminsky says, ""people might get used to ignoring the browser warnings"" because of the shutdown. ""Then you think you're really walking into this site and you're really not.""He offers a worst-case scenario: Imagine if the security certificate was down for the Social Security Administration website and a bad actor set up a fake site. Someone could go to the bogus site, enter their password, and give the hackers access to personal information.The shutdown also means there are fewer IT staff on hand. For instance, around 2,000 employees — down from the usual 3,500 — are working at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, one of the agencies leading the nation's cyberdefenses, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget's contingency plans.Rob Ragan, a partner in the cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox, says that means a lot of important tasks may not be done, such as updating software with the latest security patches.""You end up getting buried in a really big backlog of issues that you may never dig yourself out of,"" he says. ""And, at that point, one of those issues may have been an indicator of a compromise or a breach that may go unnoticed for months or years to come.""Security researchers worry that the shutdown is like putting a red blanket in front of a bull. Nations like Russia, China and Iran could see it as a signal to charge ahead. Meanwhile, Ragan says, think about the amount of information on government websites that's personal and even classified.And the likelihood of security lapses increases as the shutdown drags on, says Vikram Thakur, a technical director at the security firm Symantec. ""We're in the fourth week of a shutdown right now,"" he says. ""But as time goes on and on, that risk is most definitely going to go up exponentially.""Ironically, Thakur says, having fewer personnel on the job lowers at least one kind of security risk: email phishing. That's when hackers send an email with a link that unleashes malware into the system.""If nobody's opening e-mail and nobody's using the work network, the chances or the success rate for attackers who are using email as their primary mode of attack"" drop, Thakur says.NPR asked the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Division for comment but did not hear back. House Democratic aides say they're also unable to get information about which federal IT workers are on the job. But they want to see details when the shutdown ends. In the event of a future shutdown, Democrats might move to keep all IT workers on the job in the name of cybersecurity."

The proposal had multiple components, including requests for:In exchange for:The president said these measures would allow three more years of certainty to work on a larger immigration deal. However, even before he spoke, the deal appeared to be dead on arrival with Democratic leaders. They insisted Trump needs to open the government before beginning any negotiations over border security or barrier funding. Before the speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., responded to initial reports of the president's offer by calling it ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable."" She added that Trump's proposal does not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.""Some 800,000 federal workers throughout the country have either been furloughed or made to work without pay. Workers have now missed one paycheck and will miss another if the shutdown is not resolved in the next week. Trump has signed legislation to give back pay to federal workers once the government is reopened.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledged to put Trump's proposal up for a vote this week. ""Everyone has made their point — now it's time to make a law,"" McConnell said in a statement shortly after the speech. ""I intend to move to this legislation this week. With bipartisan cooperation, the Senate can send a bill to the House quickly so that they can take action as well. The situation for furloughed employees isn't getting any brighter and the crisis at the border isn't improved by show votes. But the president's plan is a path toward addressing both issues quickly.""Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, praised Trump's move and put the ball in Democrats' court.But not everyone in the conservative base was happy with Trump's proposal. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter called Trump's move ""amnestying millions of illegals.""During this, the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, Trump has suffered in the polls, which have found more people blame the president than congressional Democrats. And that number is on the rise. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll also found Trump's approval rating down to 39 percent and slipping with his base.Coming out Saturday and making this speech was an attempt by the president to reclaim the narrative and appear conciliatory. Democrats indicate the president did not reach out to them before the speech and don't see what he's doing, as Pelosi noted, as a good faith effort at compromise.Trump's offer is based, in part, on bipartisan legislation proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., known as the Bridge Act. The bill would give three years of protections to the so-called ""DREAMers"" — immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. But before Trump's speech, Durbin, a member of the Democratic leadership in the Senate, rejected Trump's use of the bill in this way and called for the government first to be reopened before any negotiations on a border barrier could take place.""First, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today,"" said Durbin, the minority whip in the Senate. ""Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues.""This is the latest move by the White House in the midst of its showdown with Democrats, who have balked at providing the money for construction of a border wall. Democrats contend that Trump's push for the wall is immoral and that it is an ineffective way to stop illegal crossings.Trump argues a wall is necessary for national security. He has refused to sign any spending bill without funding for it. Back in December, the president indicated that he would sign temporary funding measures to keep the government open but then faced a backlash in conservative media over it. He reversed course, which led to the shutdown. Until now, the White House had said it would be open to negotiating on the amount of money it will accept for a wall but has been noncommittal about offering other concessions to Democrats. Almost a year ago, Democrats offered some $25 billion in exchange for a path to citizenship for those almost 700,000 DACA recipients. Democrats say Trump balked at the offer, demanding more after Democrats thought they had a deal.Democrats have passed several bills out of the House to fund and reopen agencies that are currently shut down. McConnell has not brought them to the floor of the Senate, deferring instead to the need for negotiations between Trump and Democrats."

But she told reporters Friday that in the midst of the planning, word came that the White House had leaked that the delegation was preparing to travel commercially.""The fact that they would leak that we were flying commercial is a danger not only to us but to other people,"" she said, adding it was ""very irresponsible on the part of the president."" Told that the White House denied being the source of the leak, Pelosi responded, ""I rest my case.""In a statement released by her office earlier Friday, spokesman Drew Hammill said: The White House, in a statement released on background, called the charge ""a flat out lie.""""When the Speaker of the house and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decide to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, the world is going to find out. The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat out lie,"" the statement said.Later, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders elaborated. ""It is outrageous that she would accuse the president of the United States of putting any life in jeopardy,"" Sanders said. ""In fact the reason he didn't want her to go is because he's trying to protect American citizens. He wants to secure our border. And he wants a solution and he wants her to stay here to help him fix it.""Hammill said that ""in light of the grave threats caused by the President's action, the delegation has decided to postpone the trip so as not to further endanger our troops and security personnel, or the other travelers on the flights.""He posted a similar response on Twitter after a White House reporter cited an administration official saying claims about the leak were a lie.As speaker, Pelosi is the second in line to succeed the president and travels with a security team, usually on planes provided by the military.Pelosi's delegation had planned to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan. She said it would have been her ninth trip there. The original plans also included a stop to meet with NATO leaders in Brussels.Trump on Thursday sent a letter to Pelosi calling the trip ""a public relations event"" and said it should wait until the government shutdown, now in its 28th day, ends.Trump's letter came a day after Pelosi wrote to Trump suggesting he postpone his planned State of the Union address to Congress on Jan. 29 because of the shutdown.Asked if the president's revoking the use of a military aircraft was in retaliation for that, Pelosi said, ""I don't think the president would be that petty, do you?""The White House Office of Management and Budget, meanwhile, issued a memo requiring that any proposed congressional travel using ""government owned, rented, leased, or chartered aircraft"" must first be approved by the White House chief of staff for the duration of the shutdown.Late Friday, Trump tweeted that he would be ""making a major announcement"" about the Southern border and the shutdown on Saturday at 3 p.m. ET.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/18/686003135/federal-shutdown-has-meant-steep-health-bills-for-some-families","Updated at 3:14 p.m. EST.Joseph Daskalakis' son Oliver was born on New Year's Eve, a little over a week into the current government shutdown, and about 10 weeks before he was expected.The prematurely born baby ended up in a specialized neonatal intensive care unit, the only one near the family's home in Lakeville, Minn., that could care for him.But Daskalakis, who works as an air traffic controller outside Minneapolis, has an additional worry: The hospital where his newborn son is being treated is not part of his current insurer's network and the partial government shutdown prevents Daskalakis from filing the paperwork necessary to switch insurers, as he would otherwise be allowed to do.As a result, he could be on the hook for a hefty bill — all the while not receiving pay. Daskalakis is just one example of federal employees for whom being unable to make changes to their health plans really matters.Although the estimated 800,000 government workers affected by the shutdown won't lose their health insurance, an unknown number are in limbo like Daskalakis — unable to add family members such as spouses, newborns or adopted children to an existing health plan; unable to change insurers because of unforeseen circumstances; or unable deal with other issues that might arise.""With 800,000 employees out there, I imagine that this is not a one-off event,"" says Dan Blair, who served as both acting director and deputy director of the federal Office of Personnel Management during the early 2000s and is now senior counselor at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""The longer this goes on, the more we will see these types of occurrences.""While little Oliver Daskalakis is getting stronger every day — he's now out of the ICU, according to his father's local air traffic union representative — it's unclear how the situation will affect his family's finances.That's because out-of-network charges are generally far higher than being in-network, and NICU care is enormously expensive,no matter what. Those bills could add up, especially as the family's current insurance plan has an out-of-pocket maximum of $12,000 annually. Because Oliver was born before the new year, the family could face that amount twice — for 2018 and for 2019.And Daskalakis still isn't getting paid.""I don't know when I'll be able to change my insurance, or when I'll get paid again,"" Daskalakis wrote to Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., who shared the letter on Facebook and before her Senate colleagues last week.Other families are also worried about paperwork delays, and the financial and medical effects a prolonged shutdown could cause.Dania Palanker, a health policy researcher at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, studies what happens when families face insurance difficulties. Now she's also living it.After arranging to reduce her work hours because of health problems, Palanker knew her family would not qualify for coverage through her university job. No problem, she thought, as she began the process in December of enrolling her family in coverage offered by her husband's job with the federal government.But there was a hitch.""We could not get the paperwork in time to apply for special enrollment through the government and get it processed before the shutdown,"" Palanker says.Georgetown allowed her to boost her work hours this month to keep the family insured through January, but Georgetown's share of her coverage will end in February.Palanker's treatments are expensive, so she is likely to hit or exceed her annual $2,000 deductible in January — then start over with another annual deductible once the family secures new health coverage.""I'm postponing treatment in hopes that it is just a month and I'm back on the federal plan in February,"" says Palanker, who has an autoimmune disease that causes nerve damage. ""But I can't postpone indefinitely, as my condition will get worse.""Overseeing federal health benefits programs is within the purview of the Office of Personnel Management, whose data hub is operational, according to a spokeswoman. But getting information to that data hub to make the kind of changes Daskalakis, Palanker and others need depends on the individual agencies that employ government workers.The OPM has told government agencies ""that they should have [human resources] staff available during the lapse, specifically to process"" such requests, which are called ""qualifying life events,"" the spokeswoman says.Workers enrolled in plans under the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, which covers about 5 million federal workers and retirees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, can make qualifying life event changes directly with the insurer if they can't get it processed by their workplace, an association spokesman said Friday.In a written statement Wednesday, Smith said: ""Oliver's story is a powerful reminder that hundreds of thousands of real families have had their financial and personal lives turned upside down by this unnecessary shutdown."" The Minnesota senator called on the president to come back to the negotiating table.For Daskalakis, there's been some recent good news.His union representative, Tony Walsh, says both the OPM website and Daskalakis' insurer now indicate that the family's request to change to an insurance plan that classifies the hospital as ""in-network"" will be retroactive to Oliver's birthday — so the out-of-network charges may not play a role.Just to be safe, ""Joe is currently working on an insurance appeal based on no in-network care [being available],"" Walsh reports in an emailed statement.Still, the family has already received an initial $6,000 bill from the hospital, Walsh notes. He says that $6,000 does not include costs associated with Oliver's birth or his stay in the intensive care unit — those charges likely are still to come.Walsh says the shutdown is affecting a broad swath of employees in ways many lawmakers never anticipated.The workers ""are essential to the system,"" he says, ""and it's unfair they are being treated this way.""Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."

Pop-up food banks are giving out supplies, restaurants are feeding employees for free and banks are offering low-interest loans.Other efforts, like the Harlem Globe Trotters offering free tickets, have tried to build morale among employees who missed their first paycheck last week.Now anyone can offer a little encouragement to a government worker, at least within the District of Columbia, by buying them a beer.""Beers available NOW,"" reads the Pay It Furloughed website. As of Wednesday evening, more than 1,400 free beers were available to furloughed and unpaid federal workers, with over 260 already consumed. Both numbers were rising steadily into the night.Nevin Martell, a food writer, started the venture over the weekend with Al Goldberg, founder of culinary incubator Mess Hall. Martell tells NPR their goal is to facilitate ""a small human gesture"" over long distances. ""If you were sitting next to someone in a bar, and they were complaining about having a bad day at work because they were forced to be there without being paid, or they were stuck at home because they were furloughed, you'd probably say 'Hey, next round's on me!' "" Martell says.One beer, tax included, comes to $7.50 for donors. Anyone over 21 with a valid federal I.D. can claim the beers at four partners: Atlas Brew Works, DC Brau, Shop Made in DC and 3 Stars Brewing Company. Pay It Furloughed says it has raised over $10,000.The prospect of a free beer might bring little relief to more than 100,000 D.C. federal employees affected by the shutdown, especially those who are struggling to pay mortgages and worried about where their next meal might come from.  But Martell says the initiative doesn't just aim to cheer up workers. It's also intended to support local businesses with economic ties to the government. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser says the partial government shutdown has had ""immediate impacts"" on the city's economy, as federal workers and contractors continue to go unpaid. ""People not working means they're not using the Metro, they're not using rideshare, they're not using services,"" Bowser told Here & Now earlier this week.Justin Cox, founder of Atlas Brew Works in northeast D.C., says his brewery has felt that impact.  ""We've seen a slowdown in our sales in the taproom and our distribution ... around D.C.,"" he tells NPR. ""People are tightening their belts a little bit. They're spending less time going out to eat and on leisure activities like craft beer.""The brewery is also waiting for government to reopen so the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau can approve labels for a new beer sitting in a tank in his taproom, which can't be packaged until it gets that approval.But he says Pay It Furloughed has at least helped stem his company's losses. So far, Atlas Brew Works has served close to 90 beers under the program.Rachel Murray, a bartender at Atlas Brew Works, says she's seen an influx of people in the past few nights, which is unusual for a week with both a shutdown and a snowstorm. She's been bartending for 13 years, and she says what happens on Capitol Hill often affects local businesses.Pay It Furloughed ""has definitely has brought in more business this week,"" she tells NPR. ""People have been coming out who have been stuck inside and have cabin fever, so it's nice for them to come out and get a free beer.""And, she adds, most of the federal employees have been generous tippers."

According to the zoo's website, the live animal cams require federal resources and funding, so they've gone dark during the shutdownThe zoo receives approximately 70 percent of its funds from the federal government, and because the cams are deemed ""nonessential,"" they are shut off. The Giant Panda Cams usually show Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and Bei Bei eating, playing and even delighting in an occasional snow day. Volunteers also use the cams to collect behavioral data. No need to worry about the animals — they are still being cared for and fed. Still, the switched-off cams are upsetting fans who turn to them for stress relief.Devan Kreitzer, who describes himself as an ""avid panda cam watcher,"" laments to NPR: ""It's one thing to potentially mess with my tax return, but it's something a whole lot worse to mess with my panda cam.""Other users took to Twitter to express their frustrations.The zoo's elephant, naked mole rat and lion cams are offline as well.

President Trump's economists have now doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week.They originally estimated the partial shutdown would subtract 0.1 percentage point from economic growth every two weeks. Now, they see that loss happening every week the shutdown lasts, according to a CNBC report citing an unnamed official.The economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The partial shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — is in its fourth week. On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the partial shutdown's economic effects are a ""little bit worse"" than the administration first thought.During an interview on the Fox Business Network, Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, noted that White House economists had originally miscalculated the rate of damage in part because they failed to account for government contractors.

The speech, which the president would deliver to a joint session of Congress and a national broadcast audience, was originally scheduled for Jan. 29.The shutdown, now in its 26th day, affects nine government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, of which the Secret Service is a component. Secret Service agents and other federal law enforcement officers have been working without pay since the shutdown began last month.In her letter, Pelosi wrote, ""The U.S. Secret Service was designated as the lead federal agency responsible for coordinating, planning, exercising, and implementing security for National Special Security Events."" She added, ""However, both the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security have not been funded for 26 days now — with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs.""Pelosi continued, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th.""The White House did not immediately respond to Pelosi, but her letter prompted some back and forth between Democrats and Republicans.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen brushed aside Pelosi's security concerns, tweeting that ""The Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the Service for their mission focus and dedication and for all they do each day to secure our homeland.""House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said, referring to Pelosi, ""It's not a security issue; it's politics and she knows it."" And House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement that ""now more than ever, our leaders from both parties should all gather together in Congress to hear the state of our union from our President.""   He also tweeted, ""What are Democrats afraid of Americans hearing?But House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said because of the ""Trump shutdown,"" the Secret Service is not fully operational. ""It would be completely inappropriate for President Trump to further deplete the agency's resources and manpower for the sole purpose of having an hour of uninterrupted prime-time television coverage,"" he said.Working together as Pelosi suggests has not been a simple or productive exercise between congressional Democratic leaders and the president as they try to resolve the standoff over Trump's insistence that any bill to fund government include $5.7 billion for a border wall and Democrats' continued opposition.Trump walked out of the last meeting he had with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and no Democrats attended a meeting between Trump and rank-and-file lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday.Presidents traditionally deliver their State of the Union messages at the invitation of the House speaker, although as Pelosi noted in her letter, until the Wilson administration most simply sent written messages to lawmakers."

The number of call outs has continued to rise since the holidays as a result of the partial government shutdown, the agency says.Some airports have had to consolidate and slow operations because of the unexpected absences, leading to long lines and closed checkpoints. But the agency says the average wait time across the country remained within ""normal TSA times of 30 minutes."" Over 99 percent of passengers waited less than a half hour, while 94.3 percent spent less than 15 minutes in security lines, according to the agency. For PreCheck lines, the average wait stayed under the expected 10 minutes.""On a daily basis, the dedicated TSA men and women across the country who continue to report for work at airports across the nation demonstrate commitment and professionalism at the highest levels,"" the statement reads.While the TSA did not release staffing breakdowns by airport, due to security concerns, the absences have had an outsized effect at certain airports, as NPR's David Schaper reports. Atlanta, Houston, Washington-Dulles, Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth are among airports that have had to close security lanes and checkpoints because of a shortage of screeners.In Atlanta, travelers waited for almost 90 minutes in lines that snaked through the country's busiest airport. Elise Durham, a spokeswoman for the Hartsfield-Jackson airport, advised travelers to arrive three hours early.""Given the federal shutdown, we are beginning to feel a little bit of an impact, as it pertains to having some TSA workers who have not reported to work,"" Durham tells NPR.TSA data show Dallas Love Field experienced the second-highest peak wait times after Atlanta, though The Dallas Morning News reports the lines were unrelated to TSA staffing shortages. Honolulu, Newark and Miami had the next longest maximum wait times, all clocking in at just under half an hour.Peak wait times for PreCheck passengers were highest at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, at 14 minutes.Government workers, including TSA agents, recently missed their first paycheck of the year, as a result of the country's longest partial government shutdown. Federal employees are expected to receive back pay for hours worked during the shutdown, once the political stalemate ends. But TSA employees are among the lowest-paid government workers. Agents earn an average of about 17 to 20 dollars an hour, and many live paycheck to paycheck, as NPR has reported. MSNBC's Ali Velshi says some employees are calling in sick in order to work other jobs that pay their bills.""They're very frustrated,"" Velshi tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson. ""They're hoping this ends soon.""Meanwhile, food banks have stepped in to help furloughed and unpaid government workers, including TSA employees. And Schaper reports that air travelers across the country have been gracious, offering thanks to the employees, who are forbidden to accept tips.""It makes it easier to do what we have to do,"" an unnamed employee, who was not authorized to speak to the media, told Schaper. ""There's nobody giving you complaints about you having to go through their bag. It just makes it easier so we can get you to your plane.""

The Trump administration said last week that the shutdown would not impact tax refunds.Bringing workers back into service is necessary ""to protect Government property, which includes tax revenue, and maintain the integrity of the federal tax collection process,"" the document says.The IRS ""Shutdown Contingency Plan"" says the agency has 80,265 employees, and 46,052 workers ""would be retained in the case of a shutdown.""The agency will not perform audits, or other agency functions such as taxpayer assistance, during the shutdown.The recall to work without pay was not welcomed by the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 70,000 IRS workers. In a statement, the union says the IRS employees are being forced ""to show up in exchange only for an IOU.""The union has filed two lawsuits against the administration. The first suit challenges the government's ability to require federal employees to work without pay. The second suit argues that the Constitution bars the government from entering obligations (such as eventually paying workers after the shutdown is over) unless the funds are appropriated by Congress. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., denied a request for a temporary restraining order Tuesday. Another hearing is scheduled for Jan. 31.""There is no doubt the IRS needs to get ready for the 2019 filing season that starts Jan. 28, and IRS employees want to work. But the hard, cold reality is that they've already missed a paycheck and soon they'll be asked to work for free for as long as the shutdown lasts,"" said NTEU National President Tony Reardon.""I'm worried whether these employees will have the money to put gas in their car to get to work,"" he added."

O'Duden is general counsel for the National Treasury Employees Union that brought the suit in consolidation with a claim from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.""We will continue our fight to rectify what we think is an erroneous decision,"" O'Duden adds.The workers had sued for a temporary restraining order that would remove the obligation to go to work if they were not being paid. O'Duden says he represents about 150,000 people but seeks relief for about 400,000 federal employees who have been deemed ""excepted,"" meaning they are required to work without pay. In their suit, the plaintiffs claimed that the government has authorized agencies ""to require employees to work in a far broader range of circumstances"" than the law provides. They wanted that law ruled unconstitutional and for government offices to stop requiring that workers do their jobs without payment.U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon denied the workers' request for a restraining order that would require the government to pay its employees or allow them to stay home, The Washington Post reports. He reportedly said it would be ""profoundly irresponsible"" to issue an order that would keep thousands of workers off the job. With his ruling,  Leon maintained the status quo. However, he asked for further information from the government and union, O'Duden says. The attorney says the judge will hear additional arguments on Jan. 31.The Department of Justice representing the government has declined NPR's request for comment. The NTEU represents workers at the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Parks Service and several other offices. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association represents about 24,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees working during the shutdown without pay, The Post reports.""[Judge Leon] indicated that he believed that federal employees would in the end get paid. They may well get paid, or they may not,"" O'Duden tells NPR. He says although Congress and President Trump have expressed interest in issuing back pay to furloughed workers, ""the president, he changes his mind quite a bit, and so I don't think any assumption can be made about if in the end they will get paid.""The shutdown is the longest in U.S. history and has had wide effects on thousands of workers.Admiral Karl Schultz, Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, tweeted, ""To the best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our Nation's history that servicemembers in a U.S. Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in appropriations."" He published a letter to Coast Guard members sharing news that USAA had donated $15 million to the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance program.Federal workers have resorted to visiting food banks and taking second jobs to pay their rent, mortgage, childcare and other financial obligations.The Guardian's Jamiles Lartey tells NPR's All Things Considered the shutdown is having an outsized effect on black workers. African-Americans rely on the wages and job security of government work that they historically struggled to find in the private sector, she says. Black-owned firms are also more likely to work with federal contracts, which will not receive back pay.Attorney O'Duden says he hopes the next court hearing will make progress in releasing 400,000 excepted federal employees from their obligations to work without pay.""There was no victory today,"" O'Duden concedes. ""I think this is part of a process. And our fight goes on.""Previous lawsuits to get back pay and damages from the government have taken years to resolve. Attorney Heidi Burakiewicz represents two people working at the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are also suing the government over this year's shutdown. She tells All Things Considered that it took four years to win a lawsuit she filed on behalf of federal workers during the 2013 shutdown. "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/01/14/684432894/barely-treading-water-why-the-shutdown-disproportionately-affects-black-american","As the government shutdown enters its fourth week — becoming the longest in United States history — federal workers around the country are struggling to make ends meet. But according to Jamiles Lartey, a reporter with The Guardian, the shutdown is having a disproportionate effect on black workers and their families.African-Americans make up a higher percentage of federal workers than they do of the non-government workforce. That's in part because, for generations, government work has provided good wages and job security to African-Americans who faced more overt discrimination in the private sector.Ari Shapiro of NPR's All Things Considered sat down with Lartey to talk about some of the ways this disparity is playing out right now.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Ari Shapiro: Could you explain the history that led to our situation today, where African-Americans make up a higher percentage of the federal workforce than they do in the private sector?Jamiles Lartey: The federal government obviously has its own untoward history of racial discrimination, from underwriting redlining, and federal mortgage programming, and excluding blacks from New Deal programming. But it has also been at the institutional vanguard of the nation's slow march towards equality — more so than the private sector at large, and more than most state and local governments. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed executive order 8802, which banned race discrimination in the defense industry. And that's largely seen as the most important move in support of the civil rights of black Americans from Reconstruction all the way until 1964, when the civil rights act was passed. The federal government, for fairly obvious reasons, just did a better job of abiding by the civil rights act than the labor market at large.We know that black families have a fraction of the wealth of white families. According to the Census Bureau, for every $100 in white family wealth, black families have just over $5. So what does that mean when black government workers start missing a paycheck?The profound racial wealth gap in the U.S. makes it far more difficult for the average black American to sustain a long period without a paycheck, as compared with white Americans.We should note that that disparity in wealth is probably much less acute among federal workers. We don't have numbers of black federal workers' wealth versus white federal workers' wealth. It's probably much closer than the broader disparity. But overall, black Americans are less likely to have friends, family, networks, access to credit, you name it. Things that will help you survive a period without a paycheck, they're less likely to have it.Tell us about one of the workers you spoke with for this story?I think the most interesting person who I spoke to from my story was an employee from the National Park Service named Laura. I had spoken to her last year, during that government shutdown, and she had asked to be made anonymous in that story. She didn't want to rock the boat, she didn't want to risk retribution. After going through this government shutdown, she was adamant. She was like, ""I want my name out there."" She was frustrated, and on the verge of tears when we spoke. She was trying to collect some medication, worried about how she was going to pay for it, worried about her employees, worried about the contractors who work under her.What sorts of things is she going through?She described it as barely treading water. She said her mom called her and said, ""There's a bed here if you need to come."" And she's like, ""I'm fifty years old, I'm not about to go live with my mother.""As tough as this is for government employees, they can at least expect to get backpay. Government contract workers may not. And you say that will also disproportionately affect black business owners. How so?Actually much more so, and that's the next thing we ought to look at. Unlike federal employees, there's no precedent for government contractors to receive back pay when the shutdown ends, so that income is just gone. Black-owned firms comprise just 2 percent of all small businesses in the country but they make up 11.7 percent of registered federal contractors. That's almost the proportion that black Americans make up in the population. Another way to put that would be, black employees are overrepresented by about 150 percent in federal employees, but black firms are overrepresented by 550 percent in federal government contracting. I say that with the caveat that we don't know exactly how that trickles down to folks wages. But by and large, black-owned firms are going to be hit much harder by the shutdown.Tell me about the gender divide here. Women make up 60 percent of the federal workforce — higher than the percentage they make up of the general population. What's the significance of that gender divide on African-American families?African Americans are about 10.5 percent of the civilian labor force, but 18.4% of federal employees. According to data from the office of Personnel Management, the share of federal workers who are black women is roughly twice as high in the federal government as it is in the greater civilian workforce. This won't be new to anyone who studies race in America or is cognizant of how it works, but it's going to disproportionately affect black women.Do you get a sense that this prolonged, shutdown — the second shutdown in two years — is going to affect the way black workers think about government jobs more broadly?It would have to, right? The effect of repeated shutdowns is going to be cumulative. One shutdown four or five years ago is one thing. To have another one last year and another one this year, and to see less light at the end of the tunnel in this one than in previous shutdowns — it's affecting folk's financial stability, it's affecting their morale, and it's disproportionately affecting black workers. One of the folks who I talked to is a federal worker who described growing up in Prince George's county, which is one of the largest communities of middle class and upper-middle-class black people in America. That's largely because of access to so-called ""good jobs"" in the federal government.Growing up, he said he was told, ""Get a good job in the government."" His mom worked for the government. His dad worked for the government. But if this continues to happen, and shutdowns continue to be used in political ways over fights in Congress, a whole generation of people is going to have to reevaluate whether that's still the case."

But Sears is no multimillionaire pop star. In fact, money is tight for Sears, a federal correctional officer in Safford, Ariz.Since the government shutdown began, Sears has kept the heat off at home, hoping to save $100 this month while she isn't getting paid.""If it gets to about like 50 degrees or something, it gets really cold in here. I'll turn it on and get it up to maybe like 60 or 65 and then I'll turn it off again,"" Sears, 30, explains.As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, she and other furloughed federal workers and government contractors are struggling to pay their bills.Grocery stores and restaurants are handing out free food. Unions are negotiating to get their members more time to pay utility bills. And banks and credit unions are waiving late fees or offering low- or no-interest loans to qualified borrowers.Sears is still working 10-hour shifts at the prison. When she's not, she's calling her mortgage and car lenders about deferring payments. She's also scouring the house for things she could sell — including a prized camper van she just paid off.Sears is a single mom raising a 6-year-old boy on her own. Since the shutdown began, she's switched to cheaper grocery stores and buying frozen, not fresh.She drives less and had to explain to her son why a $3 video game isn't in the budget: ""Mommy doesn't have money right now. ... I'm not getting a paycheck,"" she says she told him. ""And he's like, 'But you go to work, Mom. ... Well, when I get older I'm going to work and I'll help you.' ""The length of the shutdown — now the longest ever — is ""uncharted territory"" that could create a host of potential challenges for federal workers, says Ted Rossman, an industry analyst with CreditCards.com.For workers who missed bills this month, another 30-day delay in payment will mean their credit scores will be affected. But, Rossman says, ""We're nowhere near that point yet. Hopefully, that gives people a little bit of comfort.""To help bridge the gap, some credit unions are offering short term, no-interest or low-interest loans. Some banks are also offering to work with furloughed employees to waive late fees on mortgage or car loans — although most lenders are only offering a one-month reprieve.That's all a lot of work for Megan Fitzsimmons, who teaches GED classes at a federal prison in Elkton, Ohio. She has to manage her late payments in between her shifts. ""You have your gas company, light company, car payment — all these things. And so I'm going to have to get the numbers, call these people, and, you know, try to put that off,"" she says.Fitzsimmons says she might have to put the bills on her credit card, to buy extra time. Congress passed a bill that would provide back pay once the shutdown ends. But in the meantime, she notes, there will be extra costs she'll never recover.""With a credit card they charge interest usually on the average daily balance, so even if we were to get paid toward the end of the month or something, I'm still going to be paying a bunch of interest on bills,"" Fitzsimmons says.More fortunate workers like Michelle Arsenault, 53, of Alexandria, Va., can dip into savings. She hasn't been going to her job at the Department of Agriculture as an organic certification adviser since Dec. 21. She's spending her free time on inexpensive ventures like hiking and studying French. But she feels especially sorry for the many federal contractors she works with.""I think about the people that work in our cafeteria in our building who aren't getting paid and they're not going to get paid retroactively,"" she says. ""They're just out three weeks' salary or however long this goes on.""Arsenault has postponed a $1,000 gardening project and she isn't going out much.""I think about the ripple effect in the community, like me canceling work that I had to have done in the yard or I'm not eating out, I'm not downtown patronizing restaurants,"" she says.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/13/684824384/as-shutdown-continues-thousands-of-federal-workers-visit-d-c-area-pop-up-food-ba","Early Saturday morning, nearly 200 people stood in the freezing cold outside a Maryland supermarket waiting to collect a small allotment of free food. They were federal employees, there to pick up fresh produce and canned goods from the Capital Area Food Bank, which organized five pop-up food distribution centers for government workers. As the partial federal shutdown — now the longest-ever in U.S. history — grinds on, its financial and emotional impact on federal workers and their families continues to grow. Across the country, some 800,000 federal employees have been sent home or are working without pay, as congressional Democrats spar with President Trump over his demands for a $5.7 billion border wall. At the end of this past week, many of them received a paycheck for zero dollars and zero cents.""They're just worried about where to get their food,"" said the food bank's president and CEO, Radha Muthiah. ""We've had someone say 'I'll pay you back after I get my paycheck, but I just need [food] now.'""More than a quarter-million federal workers live in the capital region. As Muthiah checked the workers' government-issued ID's, her tally read like a cross-section of the entire U.S. government: Department of Treasury, Smithsonian Institution, General Services Administration, Food and Drug Administration, FBI, White House. As the line moved forward, the list grew longer.The food bank — whose clients are most often people living near or below the poverty line — is helping ease at least one expense for workers whose bills keep coming even as their pay has dried up. Federal employees in line said the canned food and bags of carrots and apples would help free up funds for things like utilities, rent and baby formula. But Lorette Legendre, a General Services Administration contractor, was quick to point out that food banks cannot become a permanent solution to the government's stalemate over a barrier at the U.S.-Mexico border.""People can't survive like this,"" Legendre said. ""To stand out here in 30-degree weather to get food? This is America? Something's wrong here.""Her frustration was echoed by others in line who said they felt like political ""pawns.""""Playing with people's lives for the sake of whatever political idea you're behind, it's not good,"" said Terrence Graham, who works in IT at the State Department. ""They should value the worker a little more than that."" Graham said he and many of his colleagues live paycheck-to-paycheck.Farther down the line, an Army veteran named Dee said she is having trouble affording both food and medical treatments for a disability. She asked NPR not to use her last name because of her position at a federal agency. ""You want to serve your country,"" she said. ""Mexico is supposed to be paying for this, but instead we have to pay for it."" She added that if the shutdown continued, she might also have trouble feeding her dog. Last week, Congress approved a plan to eventually provide back pay to employees affected by the shutdown; President Trump says he's also on board. But with no clear end to the standoff in sight, some of those in line Saturday said they're considering applying for other jobs. One employee of the Office of Personnel Management said he was thinking about applying for work at McDonald's. Others said they're rethinking whether a career in the federal government is sustainable anymore. The Capital Area Food Bank says it distributed more than 30,000 pounds of fresh produce Saturday, but that the emergency efforts to help federal workers won't impact its other programs. Muthiah says many of the people her organization is helping guide people through the process of getting food assistance have never had to ask for that kind of help before.""It's hard for a lot of people,"" Muthiah said. ""It's a matter of pride, being able to have taken care of themselves and their families and now having to depend on others."" On Friday, as volunteers gathered to pack the free food, Muthiah says one woman showed up to help, but told food bank staff that she would be coming back the next day to pick up food for herself. Muthiah explained that the woman said she wanted to feel like she had ""done something in order to get that free food.""The food bank says it will continue to distribute food to federal employees until the government reopens."

Ordinarily, Woodson would be receiving a paycheck, but because of the partial government shutdown, Woodson spent his day filing an unemployment claim instead.""We should still be at work right now,"" said Woodson. ""Politicians should handle this — don't put this on the citizens. You're hurting us.""Even if Woodson can get unemployment, which pays up to $425 a week in D.C., he says it won't be enough to care for his family.""I might have to wash some cars, go back detailing or wash some windows — whatever it takes to put some food on the table,"" said Woodson.Federal workers and contractors are now missing paychecks for the first time since the partial government shutdown began on December 22. That's causing some of these workers to do what once seemed unthinkable — apply for unemployment.""The reason that I chose a public sector job was the stability of the whole thing,"" said Steve, a federal employee who also showed up to a D.C. unemployment office. He didn't want to use his full name for fear of repercussions.Steve said he left a higher-paying job in the private sector to work for the government. A big selling point in deciding to accept the new job was a shared sense of mission.""The real benefit was a job that I felt appreciated at — a job that had stability,"" said Steve. ""And right now, I feel unappreciated and unstable,"" he said.Officials in D.C. and Maryland say at least 7,000 unemployment claims have been filed by federal government workers and contractors since the shutdown began. They expect that number to rise sharply if the shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history, drags on. In all, some 800,000 employees have been affected by the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 are working without pay, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. Another 380,000 are at home on furlough. 'It's embarrassing'At a rally for federal workers and their supporters in Silver Spring, Md., on Wednesday, some federal workers said they had no choice but to consider applying for unemployment benefits.""This is the first time in my working life I am going to have to go to my creditors and say 'I don't know how to pay you.' And it's embarrassing,"" said Michelle, a long-time federal employee who didn't want to give her full name because she's worried about potential repercussions.Michelle wiped away tears as she talked with a group of women about how to apply for unemployment. She never expected to be in this position.""I show up to work. I do a good job. I'm doing everything a responsible adult is supposed to do,"" said Michelle. ""All of a sudden, it's all blown up and I don't know what else to do.""According to the federal government, the shutdown will cost at least $50 million a day in lost wages and productivity.But there are hidden costs, too, that go beyond money, said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees.""Who in [the] world is going to want to work for the federal government when [workers] are disrespected ... when people are not able to fill prescriptions, bouncing checks [and] ruining their credit?"" said Erwin, whose union represents 100,000 federal workers.   The details surrounding who is — and isn't — eligible for unemployment can get complicated.Federal employees who've been furloughed can apply for unemployment benefits; workers who've been deemed ""essential"" and are working without pay are not eligible for unemployment.And federal employees who do receive unemployment benefits will have to reimburse the government if Congress votes to give employees backpay — which typically happens when the government re-opens.Federal contractors don't get backpay from the government.The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for furloughed workers on what to do during a shutdown — including how to write to creditors and mortgage companies.On Friday, President Trump said he would sign a bill passed by both the House and the Senate to give back pay to federal workers affected by the shutdown.

After enduring more than three weeks of the ongoing partial government shutdown, hundreds of furloughed workers gathered in the Montgomery County, Md., high school to share a meal.The potluck of hearty foods such as ravioli, pizza and chicken — whatever people in the community had to donate — fed well more than 600 workers who are feeling the financial strain of missing a paycheck.There was plenty of dessert too.The meal was especially sweet for many, considering the circumstances. Just outside of Washington, Montgomery County is home to at least 750,000 federal employees, so even those who aren't furloughed are feeling the ripple effect in the community.Montgomery County Council Member Tom Hucker decided to organize the potluck, called the Shutdown Social, to help furloughed workers get out of the house and get their minds off of the shutdown.That's exactly why Melinda Batson, who works at the Food and Drug Administration, decided to show up. Her last paycheck showed nothing but zeros.""It does something mentally to you, to look at a paycheck and all you see is zeros,"" she said. ""It's nice to get out, but it's sad to see the faces of public service sitting down, taking a meal. For some people this might be their only meal.""Hucker was shocked at the event's turnout, which had only been announced the prior Monday. He said he realized that even for those with good jobs, missing three weeks of pay was heavily affecting people's lives.""They are staying home every night, they haven't gone out to dinner, they're eating fish sticks in the bottom of the freezer,"" he said.Staying at home, unsure of when she can return to work and unable to go out and spend money, is making resident Roberta Long feel stir crazy. The youngest of her two sons, who is 4 years old, also is getting antsy.Normally he attends day care at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where Long works as an IT specialist. But the government shutdown doesn't just mean no work for Long — it also means no day care.Spending 24/7 with her spirited youngster is wearing her thin.""It's been mad, it's just been like utter chaos,"" she said as her energetic son ran around the cafeteria.Looking at her son she added, ""That's not sugar, that's just life.""Her son was having a blast, so she and her husband agreed it was good for him to get out of the house. In the background, lively drumming from local high school musicians kept the energy and spirits in the room high.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., made an appearance at the event after pushing legislation to give furloughed federal workers back pay, which passed in the Senate on Thursday and in the House on Friday. The bill guarantees that federal workers eventually will be paid for the time they were furloughed and is awaiting a White House signature.""I was pleased ... to at least take the cloud of uncertainty away from federal employees and guarantee that when this shameful shutdown ends they will be paid in full, but what they really want to do is get back to work for the American people, so let's keep pushing,"" he said.Others in the area who aren't directly impacted by the shutdown also came to show support. Dozens of volunteers and sponsors helped make the event happen, including 17 local restaurants donating food, and local firefighters who came in carrying boxes of pizza.Local resident Marilyn Opitz said many others in the community are indirectly impacted — either they know someone who is currently furloughed, or their business is suffering as a result. The latter is the case for Opitz, who works as a hairstylist and makeup artist.She said many furloughed workers are her clients, and now they're canceling appointments.""It trickles down,"" she said, speaking about the shutdown's impact. ""If you live here long enough, you're going to be affected by it.""Opitz watches the news every day to check for updates on the shutdown. So does Long. But Long is not feeling optimistic.""I'm trying to make sense of it,"" she sighed. ""I feel like there's not even an end in sight."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/12/684589220/dont-panic-the-shutdown-isn-t-making-food-unsafe","Let's start with the big picture.There are about 8,000 slaughterhouses and meat processors in the United States that can't legally operate without a U.S. Department of Agriculture inspector on-site. Those inspectors are working through the shutdown.Meanwhile, 80,000 or so other food factories handle everything else, from cauliflower to cookies. The Food and Drug Administration oversees them with a very different regulatory philosophy.""The expectation is that the industry will produce safe food, period, and the FDA's job was to periodically check whether that was happening,"" says David Acheson, a former official at both the FDA and the USDA, who now runs a food safety consulting firm called The Acheson Group.In practice, the FDA carries out routine inspections at most plants only once every few years. So 99 percent of the country's non-meat food facilities were not going to get inspected this month even if all the inspectors had been working as normal. As a result of the shutdown, fewer will, but the overall impact is small.According to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the FDA is carrying on other food safety activities despite the partial shutdown. Inspectors continue to monitor food that's entering the U.S. from abroad, and they stand ready to investigate any U.S. outbreak of foodborne illness. A lot of domestic food companies, meanwhile, are subject to inspections carried out by a parallel food safety system — a private one that's similar, and sometimes even tougher, than the government's program.The system is driven by big food retailers that desperately want to avoid having their brands linked to outbreaks of foodborne illness. These companies rely on food safety standards like one administered by the Global Food Safety Initiative, an industry-backed organization based in Paris. Some, like Costco Wholesale, throw in some additional requirements on top of the industry-standard ones. Costco, for instance, requires suppliers to hold some shipments of fresh produce until tests come back negative for disease-causing bacteria.""We spend money with those suppliers, and if they can't meet our specifications from a food safety or quality perspective, guess what? We won't buy from them."" says Craig Wilson, head of food safety at Costco. In order to stay certified and keep supplying retailers like Walmart and Kroger, food processing facilities typically go through an annual inspection.But these private inspections don't have a perfect record. In 2011, an outbreak of listeria poisoning that killed 25 people was traced to fruit from a farm in Colorado that had just passed its food safety audit with a near-perfect score. Critics of the system say that private inspectors don't have an incentive to look too hard for problems because the food companies themselves pay for these certifications.In addition, there are plenty of food companies that the private inspectors don't see. ""Keep in mind that there are lots and lots of relatively small plants that are making food, that are not selling to the major chains"" like Walmart or Kroger's, says David Acheson. No big food retailers are requiring these food companies to get a safety certification.Acheson says the FDA's occasional inspections are especially important for those companies, but also to keep the big food companies honest. ""Nobody in their right mind would be complacent about an FDA inspection,"" he says, because they can be very tough, and they can have significant negative consequences for your business.""Every so often, the FDA does find problems, such as evidence of rodents in warehouses or inaccurate temperature gauges. Just knowing the FDA could show up unannounced is a good thing, Acheson says, even if the visits are rare."

The previous record was 21 days, set in the winter of 1995-96 when President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich were at odds over budget cuts. Congress went home for the weekend, as some 800,000 federal workers are on furlough, and many have now gone without their first paycheck.

Still, the White House is looking for money it could shift around to fund wall construction under an emergency declaration.Here's the latest on the shutdown and its impact: "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/12/683304824/the-longest-government-shutdown-in-history-no-longer-how-1995-changed-everything","It took three full weeks — 21 days — for President Bill Clinton and the Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to settle an impasse that partially shut down the government in 1995-96. That particular moment is a landmark in U.S. political history, birthing a new era of American gridlock that arguably led to the sharp partisanship that has gripped the nation — and delivered a new record for a partial government shutdown, marking Day 22 on Saturday. Shutdowns had been a rare thing in U.S. history. The first one came just over 40 years ago, 200 years after the country's founding. But since that time, the fisticuffs of divided government and spending disputes have become fairly commonplace — if not usually this lengthy.First shutdown was in 1976The first partial shutdown came under President Gerald Ford in 1976 when he vetoed a spending bill amid a dispute over the budget for the Department of Health, Education & Welfare (a department that no longer exists in that form or under that name).A whole slew of them followed over the next two decades. There were five during Jimmy Carter's four years in office, and eight between 1981 and 1989 during Ronald Reagan's administration. But the finger-pointing then — and the rhetoric — can feel quite familiar to today. In 1984, President Reagan laid the blame on what he saw as intransigent House Democrats. ""This has been typical of what has been happening since we've been here,"" he said, ""and you can lay this on the majority party in the House of Representatives.""Early shutdowns had familiar rhetoric but unfamiliar prioritiesThere are some big differences between those early government shutdowns and what's seen today. ""They tended to revolve around basically bargaining over routine government activities,"" said Duke University political scientist David Rohde.There would be a budget negotiation and maybe a fight over some item large or small — perhaps funding for a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (1978) or the MX missile (1982).The deadline would pass; the government would partially shut down; but the two sides would continue negotiating, confident that they would find some quick compromise that would get everything up and operating again.""There was a lot less political heat,"" Rohde said, ""and a lot less attention paid by the general public.""Then came the 1990sIn fall and winter of 1995 and 1996, Clinton was president and Republicans had control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Gingrich wanted deep budget cuts after Republicans took back the House in 1994 with their ""Contract with America.""Gingrich felt he had a mandate to enact strictures on big government. His ""contract"" promised to make government spend less and laid out galvanizing principles for his followers in Congress that also laid the foundation for the Tea Party two decades later — and the modern Republican Party. President Clinton, a Southern Democrat, said he was committed to a balanced budget. But the two sides couldn't agree on which long-term budget projections to use — the White House wanted to use data from its Office of Management and Budget, while Republicans wanted the Congressional Budget Office's. The CBO had a less optimistic view of revenue that would be coming in, thus requiring deeper spending cuts.Clinton accused the GOP of having ""failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to keep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment.""Gingrich responded: ""We think all the president has to do is commit to a seven-year balanced budget with honest numbers and an honest scoring system.""The language was bureaucratic, but it represented a huge change in how such negotiations were conducted. The dispute wasn't simply a matter of haggling over a specific department budget or a single line item; it was about ideology, getting to the very core of how big the federal government should be and how it should operate.The first shutdown that session was five days, followed by a 21-day impasse that had stood until now as the longest government shutdown ever.No easy resolutionToday's shutdown continues without a clear way out, short of the president declaring a national emergency at the Southern border and signing spending bills.There was no quick and easy solution to the dispute in 1995-96, either. Each side was certain that the public would back them. As it turned out, Gingrich and the GOP lost that particular bet. Polls at the time showed that the public put the blame on the House speaker and his party and that they wanted the government operating again.Cracks formed in the Republican solidarity, and in a session of Congress held on New Year's Eve, Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas signaled that the fight was over for his fellow Republicans.""We ought to end this,"" Dole said on the Senate floor. ""I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous as far as this senator is concerned.""The government reopened days later. It was widely seen as a setback for the GOP, and the shutdown of 1995-96 became known as a cautionary tale for years to come. Two decades without a shutdown — for a reasonAfter the political pain that was felt in the mid-1990s over that shutdown, there wasn't another one until 2013, when Republicans used budget negotiations to try to defund the Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare.""It didn't work. The shutdown did last 16 days, but, as was the case some 18 years earlier, Republicans failed to win the big prize they had targeted that year.Democrats had their own government shutdown defeat early last year. They did so in an effort to force passage of legislation aimed at giving legal immigration status to those granted special DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, status, which includes the so-called DREAMers. It was a miscalculation, and Democrats backed down quickly when poll numbers were shifting against them. Fast forward to today's shutdown, driven by Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. Rohde said it's a lot like in 1995, in that it's not a mere budget fight. But this impasse is especially difficult because of one major factor.""Trump's calculation politically is not about the center of the electorate,"" Rhode said. ""That's the difference.""The president has said he's worried about losing his hardcore base of supporters. They are anything but the kind of centrist swing voters whose opinion can give one side or another the upper hand in such negotiations.But Trump sees them as his key to victory, and he's pushing Republicans who disagree that they need to get on board as well. Small cracks have begun to show among Republicans in Congress, but it's not a gusher.And all of that makes finding a resolution especially difficult. "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/684213385/new-bottled-brews-delayed-by-government-shutdown","Craft beer drinkers in the U.S. may see fewer new bottled beers coming out in the next few months. That's because the federal agency that approves brewery labels is closed, a result of the government shutdown.The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. One of the TTB's jobs is to review beverage alcohol labels for things like alcohol content or fluid ounces in a bottle. As of Dec. 21, the TTB had received 192,279 label applications since the start of 2018. That breaks down to over 3,000 applications coming in every week.But since the government shut down, labels aren't getting approved right now. That's a problem for beermakers like Joe Katchever, owner and brewmaster of Pearl Street Brewery in La Crosse, Wis. Pearl Street is celebrating its 20th anniversary in February, and Katchever's team brewed something special for the big anniversary party. Called Deux Decadence (a nod to two decades), the stout has been aging in bourbon barrels from Kentucky for a year. But Katchever can't bottle the more than 500 cases of beer until his label gets approved by the bureau.""We can still roll out the beer in draft form,"" Katchever said. ""We're all hoping they figure out what they need to figure out and open the government back up.""Paul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association, estimates half of the craft breweries in the U.S. are in a similar position. ""Any products that need those government approvals are just kind of frozen on hold,"" Gatza said. ""I think about all the spring releases that are going to be coming out soon. Well, a lot of them won't be coming out.""Gatza said the TTB can generally approve a beer label within five to seven days. But after nearly three weeks of being shut down, the bureau is likely to have a huge backlog of applications waiting when the government reopens.""Brewers know that they're going to start at the beginning of the stack and get through them,"" Gatza said. ""So for beers that brewers want to release in February or March, a lot of them are trying to rush their paperwork in now, just so they don't get stuck having to wait months.""Industry leaders say this backlog of applications is also a concern for large beermakers in the U.S.Craig Purser, president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association, said large alcohol companies and their distributors rely on the same services from TTB that craft producers use. ""[It] doesn't matter what the size of the company is; when nobody's answering the phone, the work stops and it really puts the beer industry at a disadvantage,"" Purser said.Purser said breweries big and small worry that disadvantage could start to affect their bottom line if the government shutdown continues to keep them from bottling and selling their beers."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684093676/some-mortgage-deals-are-in-limbo-as-government-shutdown-drags-on","The partial shutdown of the federal government is causing some financial problems for furloughed workers who can't refinance their mortgages or buy homes because lenders can't verify their income. But unpaid federal employees aren't the only ones running into problems.Libby Anderson, for example, got her final divorce decree on Tuesday. She'd hoped that would mean her ex-husband would finally move out of their Des Moines, Iowa, home, where they've been living separate lives under one roof for eight months.""I mean, we were really going to take care of it today — the day after it was final — and then he would be out,"" Anderson, a marketing researcher, said in an interview on Wednesday.That didn't happen.Anderson's ex-husband is a furloughed air traffic controller, and the shutdown means he can't reach someone to help him split his government retirement account with her. She needs those funds to refinance the house under her name. And he can't qualify for his own mortgage because he hasn't been paid for three weeks.The government stalemate also means they haven't explained the pending change to their young son.""We don't have those answers yet,"" Anderson says.As the shutdown drags on, more people will find themselves facing similar roadblocks.Refinance applications are booming as mortgage rates fell nearly half a percentage point in recent weeks. But furloughed workers can't lock those rates in.Anyone looking to buy or refinance may have a harder time getting through to federal agencies to verify income taxes or get certain loan information from the Federal Housing Administration, which remains closed. Rural home loans guaranteed through the Department of Agriculture are on hold, too.Margie Hofberg, president of the Residential Mortgage Center in Rockville, Md., near Washington, D.C., says her business will likely see a ripple effect.""If I can't close and buy your house, then guess what? You can't buy the house that you were buying even though you don't work for the federal government,"" she says.Two deals nearly fell through this week, but Hofberg persuaded the lenders to waive certain paperwork. She says banks' strict requirements of borrowers create many potential snags.""My hope would be that the lenders start becoming a little more flexible, because it's not in their best interest to not do loans, either,"" Hofberg says.There's some precedent for these kinds of shutdown-related problems. During the 16-day shutdown in 2013, the National Association of Realtors says, 2 percent of home loans never closed.""The headache really is related to delays,"" says Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group's chief economist. They affected 17 percent of home loan deals during the 2013 shutdown, largely because of a big backlog.Most deals get done, Yun says, but the bigger worry is a possible impact on homebuyer psychology.""The longer the shutdown, it causes greater uncertainty about the economic direction, which means that even the private sector employees may be less willing to purchase home[s] over time,"" he says.If the shutdown moves into open house season, that could affect certain markets where there are lots of government employees.""What furloughed employees are going to go out and buy a house right now, when there's no definitive date of a compromise?"" says Gregg Busch, vice president of First Savings Mortgage, a big player in the Washington, D.C., area.He says it will likely especially hit government contractors, who outnumber federal workers.""There's a lot of contractors here that aren't getting paid,"" Busch says. ""People who own those companies, they're not going to buy, be able to refinance and they're going to start laying people off.""For Libby Anderson, newly divorced, the shutdown cannot end soon enough. While her breakup with her ex-husband has been amicable, she says sharing space is taxing.""It just feels like you're at the finish line and the finish line keeps getting moved, but you're exhausted,"" she says. ""There's not much you can do about it. You can't move the finish line closer because it's totally out of our control.""The latest her ex-husband expected to move out was April 1. But now, Anderson worries the shutdown could go beyond that date.""Obviously I wouldn't kick him out into the street,"" she says. ""But we really both need to move on and and have some physical distance from each other."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/11/683770812/most-federal-workers-health-coverage-to-continue-during-shutdown-even-if-pay-sto","As the prospect of life without a paycheck sets in for 800,000 federal employees and others affected by the ongoing government shutdown, questions are arising about health insurance and other health benefits — dental and vision coverage, and long-term care insurance.Will shuttered agencies continue to cover benefits for employees and contractors as per usual? We've dug up some answers.Are federal workers and their families still covered by their health plan? For the most part, federal employees needn't worry about that, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which has published an FAQ blog post on the topic.Both the online FAQ and the health insurance industry's trade association confirm that coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program will continue even if some federal agencies affected by the shutdown aren't issuing those paychecks and or paying the insurance premiums.""The shutdown should not impact their coverage,"" says Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group that represents insurers, including those that offer coverage through the federal program. ""It's business as usual.""Once the shutdown ends and those payments resume, workers should expect that their usual share of premiums plus the accumulated amount that wasn't deducted during the missed pay periods will be taken out.""Procedures may vary somewhat by payroll office, but the maximum additional deduction allowed under regulations is one pay period's worth of premiums (in addition to the current pay period's premium),"" says an OPM spokeswoman.Does the same hold for contract workers? Less clear is what will happen to workers under contract with the affected federal agencies — including some people working as analysts, administration assistants and janitorial staff — who are mostly excluded from the FEHB program.Many firms that contract with the federal government offer their workers insurance. The federal Office of Personnel Management recommends these contracted employees consult the human resource office at their company for answers regarding the shutdown.""In 95 percent of cases, even if it's not required by law, I would think most everyone would continue that coverage,"" says Rachel Greszler, a senior policy analyst and research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who studies economics, budget and labor issues.Contract workers who buy their own health coverage and are struggling to pay bills without their paychecks may have less recourse, beyond asking insurers for a grace period in paying premiums. But there is no requirement that insurers grant such a request.""We are concerned about the disruption that this shutdown has caused our members and their families,"" notes a corporate statement from CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield — one of the insurers near Washington, D.C. ""We are currently exploring how to best address this issue should the shutdown continue.""Beyond basic health insurance, what other health benefits could be affected? Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, dental, vision and long-term care insurance programs may start sending bills directly to workers.Federal workers pay the premiums for these benefits themselves, according to Dan Blair, who served as both acting director and deputy director of the OPM during the early 2000s. He is now a senior counselor and fellow the Bipartisan Policy Center in D.C.Because workers' checks are not being processed, the amounts usually sent to these carriers each pay period also aren't being paid. If the shutdown lasts longer than two or three pay periods, workers will get bills for premiums directly from these firms and should pay them ""on a timely basis to ensure continuation of coverage,"" the OPM says in its FAQ. Blair agrees.There also may be a delay in processing claims for flexible spending accounts. These are special accounts in which workers use pretax money deducted from their paychecks to cover certain eligible medical expenses — such as eyeglasses, braces, copayments for doctor visits or medications, including some over-the-counter products.With no paychecks going out, these deductions are not being made and transferred into FSAs. Once paychecks start up again, the amount deducted will be adjusted so the worker will get the annual total they had requested.During the shutdown, though, reimbursement claims to these FSA accounts also won't be processed, the OPM says. Blair suggests holding off on big-ticket purchases during the shutdown, if possible, and to always keeping paperwork on the purchases.Another consideration: People who switched health plans before a furlough may find their paperwork wasn't processed in time.In those cases, the OPM says to stick with the old health plan until the shutdown ends and the new plan is processed. The new plan will pick up any claims incurred.How will workers know if their change was processed? The OPM's FAQ says workers who receive an ID card in the mail are enrolled.""The new policy will be what applies and pays benefits, but there could be some administrative burdens and hassles on the part of workers if the shutdown continues much longer, if the initial bills are not going to the right insurance company,"" Greszler says.Overall, Blair says workers should continue to monitor news media sites — particularly those that focus on federal workers and issues — looking for any updates.""We're getting into uncharted territory and there are always things that pop up that no one has planned for,"" says Blair, who did not face any shutdowns during his tenure at OPM.Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent news service of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683757608/interior-restaffs-some-wildlife-refuges-during-shutdown","Just days after announcing that some furloughed staff will be returning to clean up trash-riddled national parks during the government shutdown, the Trump administration is making a similar move at dozens of wildlife refuges around the country. The plans, which have not been publicly announced, would restaff 38 wildlife refuges around the country for roughly 30 days. ""While many of our refuges have remained accessible, but not staffed, the extended lapse in federal appropriations is impacting both our ability to serve the public and to protect natural resources under our care in some places,"" wrote Margaret Everson, principal deputy director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in an internal email first reported by The Associated Press.  A similar story has played out at many of the country's national parks during the nearly three-week shutdown, creating public safety hazards in some cases, and damage to natural resources in others.The National Park Service announced Sunday that it was taking the unprecedented step of dipping into entrance-fee dollars to get some staff back at key national parks during the shutdown.The Fish and Wildlife Service will rely on previously appropriated funds from the last fiscal year that carried over, as well as some entrance funds, to do the same at wildlife refuges, said Barbara Wainman, assistant director for external affairs at the agency.  The funding, she said, should be enough to bring back approximately 240 employees for about 30 days. Hundreds of thousands of government employees remain out of work. ""We're trying to use the funding we have to both resume work on some high priority projects and activities in support of our mission and also to serve the American taxpayer whose dollars these are,"" Wainman said. Critics are panning the move as a way for the Trump administration to avoid the bad optics of a prolonged shutdown. ""This is some ad-hoc, politically based decision making,"" says Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. ""The set of rules they're playing by seems to shift every day."" During previous shutdowns, both Republican and Democratic administrations have chosen to fully close national parks and refuges. This is the second time the Trump administration has gone the other way, leaving the federally protected places largely unstaffed and open to the public.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Retirees Association, the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and the National Wildlife Refuge Association posted a letter Wednesday, urging the administration to close national parks, refuges and public lands during the remainder of the shutdown. The letter cites public safety and the protection of natural resource. Another reason, according to Geoffrey Haskett, head of the National Wildlife Refuge Association, ""is so people can see the effects of the shutdown and then go pressure Congress and the administration to get the government open again."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683638056/shutdown-shutters-many-d-c-tourist-attractions-but-not-the-one-in-trumps-hotel","The government's partial shutdown has turned Washington's National Mall into a bleak place. Trash cans are overflowing, museums and historic sites are shuttered. Park Service rangers and Smithsonian employees are furloughed as the shutdown drags on.One of the very few government-owned tourist attractions that's still open is just a few blocks away, in the clock tower of the historic, 1899-vintage Old Post Office building. Three park rangers are on duty, guiding visitors up two elevators and onto an observation deck that provide dramatic views of downtown Washington. There's also a historic set of bells that ring regularly.The Old Post Office is owned by the federal government, which leases the building to the Trump International Hotel, itself operated by President Trump's Trump Organization. And once again, Trump's stake in that hotel is controversial.A lawsuit making its way through the courts alleges that Trump is violating anti-corruption clauses of the Constitution whenever the hotel does business with foreign and state governments. Lobbyists and political allies frequently hold events at the hotel. And there are questions about whether Trump personally intervened in plans to replace the FBI headquarters, which sits across the street from the hotel, in order to protect his business interests.For Democrats and ethics watchdogs, the clock tower's continued operation during a government shutdown has raised new questions about whether Trump's business interests are getting an unfair boost from the government he sits atop of.A handful of tourists visited the clock tower Wednesday morning. ""It feels a little bit weird to be in the Trump hotel,"" said Sven Moeller, who lives in New Jersey. He laughed, adding, ""Yes, it does.""The money to pay for the park rangers comes from the General Services Administration, the agency responsible for most federal office space.When the federal government shut down on Dec. 22, the rangers were furloughed without pay. But speaking on background, a GSA official said the agency then found some money to pay the rangers' salary. Although the GSA was partially shut down and National Park Service was officially closed, they signed an agreement and the rangers returned.GSA has said the agreement was ""unrelated to the facility's tenant,"" referring to the Trump hotel.""Boy, do I have a lot of questions,"" Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., told NPR. As incoming chair of a House subcommittee that oversees the National Park Service, she said the agreement seems to benefit the president's business.""The fact that it's a short-term agreement, the fact that it was a scramble to do it during a government shutdown, just has all the makings of, you know, why did this happen? Is it legal? Is it ethical?"" she said.The clock tower is reached through a special door at the back of the hotel. The tower-only elevator is at the end of long corridors decorated with historical exhibits about the District of Columbia and the Old Post Office building. In one panel, George Washington is depicted choosing the site of the capital city; in another, Ivanka Trump inspects blueprints for the hotel conversion. A tiny souvenir shop sells Trump chocolates, Trump hoodies but no campaign items.Two watchdog groups have filed Freedom of Information requests for documents about the agreement. ""Were there communications between the White House and these agencies about whether this facility should be opened up?"" asked Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, one of the filers. ""What was the legal basis?"" he asked. ""What was the thinking?""The White House and the Trump Organization didn't reply to NPR's requests for comment.Visiting from Sydney, Australia, Jeremy Stein was just happy the clock tower was open. ""You know, politics will sort itself out,"" he told NPR. ""But once you're at the top there, you get to enjoy a nice view. So you can't really complain about that.""NPR producer Barbara Sprunt contributed reporting to this story. "

He added, ""I said bye-bye, nothing else works!""""Our meeting did not last long,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters, standing in the chilly White House driveway. ""It's cold out here, and the temperature wasn't much warmer in the Situation Room.""""Unfortunately, the president just got up and walked out,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after Pelosi said the Democrats are unwilling to agree to wall funding.""We saw a temper tantrum,"" Schumer said.Vice President Pence blamed Democrats for refusing to give ground on the wall.""In this brief meeting, we heard once again that Democratic leaders are unwilling to even negotiate to resolve this partial government shutdown or address the crisis at our Southern border,"" Pence said. ""What the president made clear today is he is going to stand firm to achieve his priorities: to build a wall, a steel barrier on the Southern border.""With the two sides at an impasse, some 800,000 federal employees are expected to miss their first paycheck, on Friday, since the shutdown began on Dec. 22.""The president seems to be insensitive to that,"" Pelosi said. ""He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money. But they can't.""Earlier, Trump met with GOP senators, urging his fellow Republicans not to waver in their demand for a border wall.""The Republicans are totally unified,"" Trump told reporters after that meeting. ""There was no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""The president insisted that a compromise is still possible, but he also threatened to use emergency powers if necessary to fund the wall.""I don't think we'll have to do that, but you never know,"" Trump told reporters. ""I really believe the Democrats and the Republicans are working together.""There was little evidence of that during the White House meeting or on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers from both parties traded barbs and blamed the shutdown on the other side's inflexibility.Trump's prime-time address from the Oval Office on Tuesday appeared to have done little to change the terms of the debate.Schumer dismissed the president's speech as ""little more than a rehash of spurious arguments and misleading statistics that the president has been using for weeks.""""In no way did the president's speech last night make a persuasive or even a new case for an exorbitantly expensive border wall,"" Schumer said, noting that he is talking about ""a wall that the president guaranteed would be paid by Mexico.""Democrats accused the president of using the shutdown to gain political leverage, while forcing Transportation Security Administration officers, food safety inspectors and Border Patrol agents to work without pay.A handful of GOP senators have broken with their party and voiced concern about the shutdown.""I don't like government shutdowns,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. ""I don't think they're a good way to govern, and we ought to be able to get our work done.""But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not budged.McConnell described the president's wall proposal as ""imminently reasonable,"" and noted that Democrats have supported similar border barriers in the past.""Steel fencing was fine, even salutary, when President Obama was in the White House,"" McConnell complained. ""But it's 'immoral' when President Trump occupies the office.""McConnell blasted Schumer for holding up Senate votes on unrelated foreign policy measures during the budget impasse.""Do Democrats want to hold everything hostage?"" McConnell asked. ""I urge my Democratic colleagues more strongly to get past this purely partisan spite.""Congressional Democrats are equally dug in.""Democrats have consistently indicated that we are willing to substantially increase funding for border security,"" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. ""But we are not willing to waste taxpayer dollars on a medieval border wall that is a fifth century solution to a 21st century problem. And we are certainly not willing to reward a presidential temper tantrum that has shut down the government for 19 days.""Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., added, ""I just think this is a situation where (Trump) is holding the American people hostage to a vanity wall fantasy. He should let that go. It's absolutely false that the border wall is the way to deal with any humanitarian crisis or national security.""Trump described the federal employees who have been furloughed or are working without pay as ""terrific patriots"" and has insisted without evidence that both government workers and the general public support his effort to secure funding for the wall.""The people out there want something to happen at our Southern border,"" Trump said. ""It's a very bad political issue for the Democrats. That I can tell you.""A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Tuesday found only about 4 in 10 Americans support the idea of building additional barriers along the border, and support has fallen since 2015. The same poll found 51 percent of Americans say the president ""deserves most of the blame"" for the government shutdown — an increase of 4 percentage points since a poll taken just before Christmas. Among Republicans, however, support for the wall is much stronger, with 77 percent approving and 54 percent supporting the shutdown as a means to that end."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683642605/how-is-the-shutdown-affecting-america-let-us-count-the-ways","Updated Jan. 10 at 3:50 p.m. ET The U.S. government has been operating under a partial shutdown since Dec. 22. The shutdown, driven by a political battle over President Trump's demand that Congress approve funds for a wall along the border with Mexico, is touching the lives of Americans in myriad ways. Nine federal departments (and some smaller agencies like NASA) are affected, at least in part, by the lapse in funding: Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, Transportation and the Treasury. Approximately 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are being required to work without pay.Congress had already passed appropriations bills funding about three-quarters of the federal government, including Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, so those departments and agencies remain operational.Lots of important things are not affected by this shutdown: Medicare, Medicaid, and the Health Insurance Marketplace (aka Obamacare). Social Security, disability checks and veterans' benefits. Getting a passport. And the U.S. Postal Service, an independent agency whose operations are funded by sales of postage and services, not taxes, keeps delivering mail.But other aspects of American life have become complicated, scarce or messy since the shutdown started. Here's a look at how it's affecting the country. Air safetyThe Transportation Security Administration is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Many of its workers are considered ""essential,"" so many are working without pay — though a greater number than usual have been calling in sick. So far, lines at airport security have not been significantly longer.TSA employees are among the lowest-paid federal workers. ""If there's no check on the 26th, I have no idea what we're going to do,"" 36-year-old Jacinda, whose husband is a TSA officer in Portland, told NPR. ""Our rent is due, the electric bill is due, our cellphones are now past due. ... I'm scared and I'm trying to be OK because I can't be sad every day for my kids, and I can't be stressed out because it affects how I parent."" She said her husband is stressed out too — and that he has been given instructions on how to file for unemployment, though he's still working 40 hours a week.Also affected: air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.""It's a very high-stress job and you need to be on your game at all times,"" says Mick Devine of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. ""There is a concern that as this goes on, the human factors aspect of this shutdown will take a toll on the psyche and concentration level of our members.""Many planes are not being inspected and pilot training is not being certified, says Capt. Dennis Tajer, a pilot for American Airlines and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. That's because many of the FAA safety inspectors aren't working.""We are able to maintain a margin of safety and security, but every day another player is pulled off the field and it comes some point where the game cannot be played properly,"" Tajer told NPR.""We are another layer of safety,"" inspector Troy Tomey told the Miami Herald. ""We're the last check of the box. Taking us out of it, mistakes can happen.""Food inspectionThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration furloughed about 40 percent of its staff since the government shutdown. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the agency has suspended all routine inspections of food processing facilities in the U.S., The Washington Post reports. He said he hopes to be able to bring inspectors to high-risk facilities as early as next week.""That puts our food supply at risk,"" Sarah Sorscher with the Center for Science in the Public Interest says in a statement. ""Regular inspections, which help stop foodborne illness before people get sick, are vital.""Food stampsThe Department of Agriculture has announced it will continue to fund SNAP (food stamps) through February. The USDA says it can keep paying SNAP benefits up to 30 days beyond the expiration of the most recent government funding resolution. That means SNAP recipients will actually get their February benefits early, on or before that spending authority expires on Jan. 20. About 1 in 10 Americans relies at least partly on SNAP benefits to buy food.The USDA's other major nutrition assistance programs have enough funding to continue operations into February.Scientific researchClimate scientists from all over the world are meeting in Vancouver this month, as the lead authors of the next international climate science report. But at least seven U.S. climate scientists who were supposed to help write it aren't there — scientists for NOAA, NASA and other federal agencies can't work or travel for work because of the shutdown. Air-quality monitoring is also affected: The Environmental Protection Agency manages sensors all over the country that detect various kinds of air pollution, such as ozone, industrial chemicals and smog. Usually, this data is released to the public right away, but because the EPA isn't operating at full strength, that's not happening. Air sensors run by state agencies and private institutions are still working, however.Coast GuardWhile the other branches of the military are part of the Defense Department, the Coast Guard falls under Homeland Security. After some maneuvering, the government found a way to pay its military members on Dec. 31. The nearly 42,000 active duty members of the Coast Guard are still working, as they are considered essential personnel, but it's not clear whether they will get a paycheck on Jan. 15.Former Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen described a wide range of operations that continue during the shutdown: search and rescues along the nation's coastlines, efforts to stop drug smugglers, even the piloting of an icebreaker to Antarctica to break the ice around McMurdo Station.""I think it's pretty bad,"" Allen told NPR. ""I think when you have people providing emergency services to this country without pay, I think we ought to take a serious look at how we're governed.""Native American communitiesThe shutdown has meant that 2,295 of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' 4,057 employees are subject to furlough. Phone calls to the bureau go unanswered.The Indian Health Service, which is funded by Interior, provides health services for approximately 2.2 million of the nation's estimated 3.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. Most of its funds are appropriated for Native Americans who live on or near reservations in the western U.S., though some funding goes to those who live in urban areas.And the IHS is being hit especially hard by the lapse in funding. As NPR has reported, its only services that can continue are those that meet ""immediate needs of the patients, medical staff, and medical facilities.""IHS clinics are open during the shutdown and many staffers are reporting for work because they're considered essential, but they aren't being paid. Grants to support tribal health programs and preventive health clinics are currently suspended.Immigration courts and enforcementThe country's immigration courts are closed, and they already had a huge backlog even before the shutdown. Member station KPCC/LAist reported last month that Los Angeles alone had fewer than 40 judges and nearly 74,000 pending cases.With the courts now closed, the people who were due in court have their cases moved to the back of the line and must have them rescheduled, which could add two or three years to their wait.""It's not like when we come back, we can absorb the cases,"" Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told KPCC/LAist. ""There's no magical way to tell thousands of people to just come to their court hearings two weeks later so that the ones that were not heard can be heard.""The shutdown has also halted E-Verify, a federal program that aims to prevent immigrants from working in the U.S. illegally.""There's an irony there,"" Julie Pace, an attorney specializing in employment and immigration law at the Cavanagh Law Firm in Phoenix, told NPR. ""We have an electronic wall for E-Verify that should be being used, that the government has not funded.""Federal courtsThe federal judiciary continues to operate during the shutdown, using court fee balances and other funds. Its employees are reporting to work and remain fully paid, and it estimates it has enough money to sustain paid operations until Jan. 18.If the funds run out before new appropriations are received, ""essential work"" in the federal courts will continue. ""Each court would determine the staff necessary to support its mission critical work,"" the judiciary said in a statement on Jan. 7. ""In response to requests by the Department of Justice, some federal courts have issued orders suspending, postponing, or holding in abeyance civil cases in which the government is a party for a limited period, subject to further consideration, or until appropriated funds become available.""Criminal cases are expected to continue without interruption.The arts After staying open for the first few days of the shutdown, the museums and institutions that make up the Smithsonian have all closed.The National Endowment for the Arts says it will honor its fiscal year 2019 grants and that it's currently accepting applications for 2020, though during the shutdown, nobody is working at the agency to answer any questions.And some arts organizations receive federal grants on a reimbursement basis, which means they aren't sure when they will get back the money they paid upfront.""As you can imagine, any nonprofit cultural organization struggles with cash flow, as they really need to expend funds before funds are received,"" Dorothy Ryan, managing director of Brooklyn theater company Theatre for a New Audience, told NPR. ""And the question about when the National Endowment for the Arts will be distributing funds really hits home for us.""National parksMany national parks have stayed open through the shutdown, though without staff or servicing. While in some places other parties have stepped in to help — state or local governments, tourist bureaus, or volunteer groups — not all is well.Two weeks into the shutdown, NPS announced it will dip into entrance fee funds to pay for staff and service at some parks — an unprecedented and controversial move, as entrance fees are earmarked for visitor services, not operations and basic maintenance.At California's Joshua Tree National Park, which has stayed open without rangers, visitors drove off-road through parkland, creating new, unsanctioned roads, and destroyed some of the park's Joshua trees. After first saying the park would close on Jan. 10, the NPS reversed course and announced that by using fee revenue, Joshua Tree will remain open with additional staff to deal with sanitation issues and protection of park resources.Former NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis believes the national parks have been kept open to avoid the public outcry that occurred over their closure during the 2013 shutdown. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, he warns of an array of ugly consequences of leaving the parks open: human waste in waterways, overflowing trash attracting wildlife and increasing human/bear encounters, poaching, artifact theft, and damage to fragile natural features.  One site where you can find NPS rangers during the shutdown? The tower of the Old Post Office – the building leased to the Trump International Hotel. The building is owned by the General Services Administration. As NPR reports, the rangers were furloughed when the shutdown began. But then the GSA found some money to pay their salary, and the rangers returned. Rep. Betty McCollum, incoming chair of a House subcommittee that oversees the NPS, told NPR that she has a lot of questions about the arrangement: ""The fact that it's a short-term agreement, the fact that it was a scramble to do it during a government shutdown, just has all the makings of, you know, why did this happen? Is it legal? Is it ethical?""Oil and gas drillingThe oil and gas business is booming, but much of that drilling is on federal lands and operators worry about a slowdown, Cooper McKim of Wyoming Public Media reports. The Bureau of Land Management says it is still processing online applications to drill; however, it's not clear what's actually happening with those.""Companies are waiting for leases,"" said Kathleen Sgamma of the Western Energy Alliance, a group of oil and gas companies. ""If you don't have the full lease hold, it's hard to do the exploratory work or full development work you're planning on.""That could be significant in Wyoming, where taxes from oil and gas make up a third of state revenue. More oil and gas lease sales are slated for February and March, but some in the industry worry that if the shutdown drags on, they won't happen.One place the shutdown isn't slowing proposed drilling projects is Alaska. BLM is moving ahead with holding public meetings about oil and gas drilling leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska Public Media reports. The bureau is part of Interior, one of the departments affected by the shutdown. Raúl Grijalva, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, wrote a letter to the acting secretary of the Interior, asking how these hearings are happening ""while so many other essential services remain shut down.""BLM told Alaska Public Media that it's using funds from the previous fiscal year to continue working.The District of ColumbiaWashington, D.C.'s courts are funded through the federal government, and its marriage bureau has been shuttered, leaving some engaged couples in the lurch. So the D.C. Council just passed the LOVE Act (Let Our Vows Endure Emergency Amendment Act of 2019) to give D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser the authority to grant marriage licenses during the shutdown. (As member station WAMU/DCist notes, divorces and trials have continued.)The federal government is also the largest customer of DC Water — and it told the utility company it wouldn't be paying $5 million of its quarterly bill during the shutdown, WAMU's Jacob Fenston reports. The DC Water board members joked about how to handle this big unpaid bill, perhaps by turning off the water at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.""Water is leverage,"" says DC Water spokesperson Vincent Morris. ""No one wants to go without it.""Colin Dwyer, Elizabeth Blair, Greg Myre, David Schaper, Rhitu Chatterjee, Philip Ewing, Dan Charles, Joel Rose, Rebecca Hersher, Cooper McKim, Ian Stewart, Marisa Peñaloza, Peter Overby, and Shefali Luthra contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683580878/a-warning-about-u-s-credit-rating-could-signal-higher-interest-rates","Updated at 1:08 p.m. ETA major credit rating agency is warning that it will reconsider the nation's AAA rating if the partial U.S. government shutdown continues into March and raises doubts about the ability of Congress to lift the debt ceiling. A downgrade of the nation's pristine credit rating could lead to higher borrowing costs for the U.S. Treasury, companies and consumers.A number of government agencies have not been funded since Dec. 21 amid President Trump's insistence that Congress provide $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico.With a total debt of nearly $22 trillion and rising, the government's borrowing limit must be periodically raised by Congress. The next time is in March, although the Treasury could extend that deadline by taking ""extraordinary measures"" (juggling its books).Fitch, one of three major credit rating agencies, warned Wednesday that uncertainty created by the 2 1/2-week shutdown could lead to doubts about whether lawmakers will be able to agree on raising the debt ceiling.""If this shutdown continues to March 1 and the debt ceiling becomes a problem several months later, we may need to start thinking about the policy framework, the inability to pass a budget ... and whether all of that is consistent with triple-A,"" James McCormack, Fitch's global head of sovereign ratings, said in London, according to Reuters. ""From a rating point of view it is the debt ceiling that is problematic,"" he added.The only previous downgrade for the U.S. government occurred in 2011, when Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term credit rating to AA-plus. S&P cited the government's inability to get its fiscal house in order.In an interview with CNBC Wednesday, McCormack said that with projected deficits continuing, ""you can see debt levels moving higher, you can see the interest burden in the U.S. government moving decidedly higher over the next decade. ""So there needs to be some kind of fiscal adjustment to offset that or the deficit itself moves higher and you're essentially borrowing money to pay interest on the debt,"" he said. ""So there is a meaningful fiscal deterioration going on in the United States.""In a statement last Friday, Fitch said it sees only a remote chance that the debt ceiling won't be raised, resulting in a rare default on the federal debt. But the agency warned that the nation's AAA credit rating would be at risk if there's ""evidence of greater dysfunction in fiscal policymaking.""When they took over the House last week, Democratic leaders said they will revive the ""Gephardt Rule,"" introduced in the late 1970s by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., that automatically raises the nation's borrowing limit once the House passes a budget. Failure to raise the ceiling means ""that the government won't borrow more to pay its bills — but it will still have those bills,"" NPR's Ron Elving and Danielle Kurtzleben explained. ""This is money that is set to be spent anyway — paychecks, benefit checks, outlays to contractors. Those obligations don't go away if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling."" "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/682925400/as-shutdown-crawls-on-artists-and-nonprofits-fear-for-their-fragile-industry","Updated at 8:15 a.m. ET ThursdayJill Rorem, like many Americans, had made some special plans for the holidays. The Chicago native, whose legal work often brings her to Washington, D.C., was finally going to get to see the nation's capital with her arts-obsessed kids.""I have very nerdy daughters, and they're super cool. Like, my oldest kid was Andy Warhol for Halloween,"" Rorem says. So they'd planned a grand tour of the city's museums, from the National Gallery of Art to the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, maybe even the zoo if she could convince her husband. ""They would have soaked it up. I always love watching things from my kids' eyes.""Then, the federal government partially shut down.Instead of heading to D.C., where all their dream destinations were shuttered without funding, her family lost about a thousand dollars rescheduling the trip.Now, Rorem readily concedes that her family's frustrations are far from the worst of the shutdown's fallout — but she's also far from alone. The showdown in Washington has reverberated across a vast expanse of the U.S. arts community and beyond the country's borders. It has been felt not just by the museums and their patrons, but also by Brooklyn students, Los Angeles filmmakers, domestic nonprofits and foreign artists — even among the volcanoes of Hawaii.""It's a fragile industry. It's not a rich, money-making thing,"" Robert Lynch, head of Americans for the Arts, says of the landscape of arts workers and organizations.""So any little crack — whether it is the elimination of money from the National Endowment for the Arts or the slowing of it down, like a shutdown does — it potentially affects people and their planning and their ability to attract other funders, all of that kind of thing. It's a ripple effect.""The great range of those ripplesThere are about 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations across the country, according to Lynch, and when it comes to funding, ""many of them end the year just on the edge.""So the NEA and its sister agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, often represent a critical boon to many of these groups. Both agencies reach thousands of small and large organizations around the country, including NPR. And getting a grant from the NEA or NEH helps those groups to raise funds from other sources, in turn.On its website, the NEA says it will honor all of its Fiscal Year 2019 grants and that it's accepting applications for 2020, but during the shutdown there's nobody working at either agency to answer questions.This has left many of the groups that rely on them feeling stymied and skittish.""Because federal grants are done on a reimbursement basis, we don't have the money in hand,"" says Dorothy Ryan, managing director of Theatre for a New Audience, a theater company based in Brooklyn.For more than a decade they've been taking Shakespeare to some of New York's poorest schools through a program partly funded by the NEA. This spring they're planning to introduce students to Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and though they've been awarded a $25,000 grant from the NEA, Ryan worries about when they'll actually receive it.""As you can imagine, any nonprofit cultural organization struggles with cash flow, as they really need to expend funds before funds are received,"" she says. ""And the question about when the National Endowment for the Arts will be distributing funds really hits home for us.""It has also hit home thousands of miles away in Hawaii, where Glenn McClure is feeling the pain of the shutdown in quite another way. The composer, who draws his musical ideas from nature, received a $2,000 stipend and housing from the National Parks Art Foundation to produce work inspired by the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island.So McClure is facing a double whammy: Not only is the source of his funding affected by the shutdown, so is his temporary workplace. Since the shutdown shuttered the park, he has had to cancel a scheduled concert and lecture, and he can't get into the park to carry on his research.Such concerns are not confined to Hawaii either. On the mainland, the closure of federal lands has also barred filmmakers from using some popular shooting locations, such as the Angeles National Forest near Los Angeles. The region's official film office, FilmLA, says it has already had to redirect about half a dozen prospective productions because of it.That doesn't just cause headaches for the filmmakers; it costs local authorities thousands of dollars in permit fees and potentially discourages other projects in the area.""California and Los Angeles have worked very hard to return the film industry back to the region after years of poaching by states and countries that have offered money for the industry to leave,"" says FilmLA President Paul Audley.""Every time we have a situation where the industry has to look elsewhere, it can become habitual to go away. And so our concern is that over a duration of time that this could have an impact on the level of production in our region.""""What we do, when do we pull the plug?""Complexity and frustration is nothing new to Brian Goldstein. The entertainment attorney with Goldstein & Guilliams has spent some two decades navigating the often Byzantine twists and turns of the U.S. visa process for his firm's international clients, mostly in classical, jazz and world music.""People, I think, just assume the arts show up,"" he explains. ""And I don't really think they know what's happening to get these things — you know, domestically, let alone when it involves international performances.""But he says the shutdown has only compounded those complications.""We already have the venues calling our office every day: 'What's going to happen? What we do, when do we pull the plug?' "" Goldstein says. ""And I have nothing to tell them, because everybody is just hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute on hold.""For now, visa and passport services remain open, according to a State Department spokesperson, ""as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations.""Still, he says such assurances have offered cold comfort to his clients and the venues booking them, who fear the prospect of delayed operations derailing their headline acts weeks and months down the road.""You know, it's show business — it's already fraught with risk and danger,"" Goldstein says. ""And this is one more complete unpredictable process that could blow up at any moment.""Crystal balls and cherry blossomsOf course, the shutdown also complicated matters for Jill Rorem, the mother who rescheduled her family trip to Washington, D.C. And though she did go ahead and book new tickets for the trip in April, she's careful to say that doesn't mean she's making any predictions.""Honestly, who knows if the shutdown will still be there,"" she says. ""But we decided that the cherry blossoms would be there, and we could at least walk around comfortably outside.""Glenn McClure, the composer working in Hawaii, is seeking solace in nature, too — albeit in a slightly different way.""It's frustrating to not be able to do work at the level that I had anticipated,"" McClure says. ""But I think above and beyond that, it's so important for these parks to be open, because it helps teach everyone how important the natural world is to our human life on the planet."""

""In addition, recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors starting January 10. Some visitor services, including campgrounds and entrance stations, will reopen utilizing recreation fee revenue.""The statement adds that the recreation fees will help park maintenance crews to deal with sanitation issues and pay for additional staff to protect the park from the kind of damage caused by visitors when park rangers were made scarce by the shutdown.However, some facilities will be closed.""Oasis Visitor Center, Cottonwood Visitor Center, and Black Rock Nature Center will remain closed for the duration of the lapse in appropriations,"" said the statement. ""Entrance stations will be open to provide safety and resource protection messages to arriving visitors, but entrance fees and camping fees will not be collected.""On Tuesday park officials said few rangers were on hand to prevent off-road driving, leading to the destruction of the park's namesake trees.""While the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,"" the park said in a statement.""Law enforcement rangers will continue to patrol the park and enforce the closure until park staff complete the necessary cleanup and park protection measures.""In a tweet, park officials said the closure will ""allow staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations.""For the past several days, volunteers have stepped forward to help clean the park, which covers nearly 800,000 acres in the Mojave and Colorado deserts east of Los Angeles and draws 4 million visitors annually.The announcement is only the latest park closure prompted by the government shutdown, which has resulted in overflowing toilets and trash bins.Parts of Yosemite National Park are closed, as well as much of Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks."

Even though the government is shut down, those announcements appeared ahead of a speech scheduled for Tuesday night in which President Trump is expected to make a case that there's an ""emergency"" on the border and a later trip to the border to see it himself.""As this is the only public release that DOJ has put out during the government shutdown, it is of high national importance,"" a Justice Department spokesperson said in a written statement Monday. Authorities also highlighted the cases in an official Twitter stream.Longtime law enforcement observers wondered to NPR how those cases fit into the public safety or national security exception, especially because the defendants had been held in federal custody for years before their sentencing.But the DOJ emphasis on trafficking does fit with recent rhetoric from Trump, who has been citing the threat of sex trafficking as one of the reasons he wants to build a wall along the Southern border. Trump has said, without evidence, that such a wall would have a ""huge effect"" on trafficking. The administration wants Democrats to agree to authorize some $5 billion for a border wall and end the impasse over funding the government that has idled much of the Justice Department and other agencies.Democrats won't go along. They argue the United States can enhance its border security without a physical barrier and also want to deny Trump the ability to fulfill a signature campaign promise — although Trump had also said that Mexico would pay for a wall.Former prosecutors pointed out to NPR that the public fight over the wall has largely pushed developments in the ongoing investigation of Russian election interference out of the news. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his team are covered by a separate funding stream and are at work despite the partial federal government shutdown.Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said that the decision about whether to issue press releases publicizing cases is a ""discretionary"" one and that despite the furlough, her small team is continuing to operate in a ""limited manner.""""We've tried in our limited capacity to answer requests as we're able and are issuing occasional news releases,"" Kupec told NPR.Across the country, U.S. attorneys have issued more than a half-dozen news releases since the shutdown about cases of interest, including the indictment of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya for alleged obstruction of justice."

While many taxpayers may not feel this is a great loss, they'll still have to pay their taxes — and the shutdown has created a good deal of uncertainty for everyone planning to file their tax returns in the coming months.But fear not, the White House says; tax refund checks will be sent out, even though the IRS, part of the Treasury Department, is for the most part closed.Office of Management and Budget acting Director Russell Vought told reporters Monday that tax refunds will go out, contrary to previous government shutdown policies.""We have tried to make this as painless as possible, consistent with the law,"" he said.It's not clear, however, how it will happen smoothly, given the 70,000 IRS employees who are furloughed.It is nearing the time of year when many of us start receiving our W-2 forms and begin to search through the files or shoeboxes for the receipts and other documents in that annual chore known as filing our taxes.But don't expect many answers from the IRS to questions you might have about the new tax law.""It was always going to be a stretch for a very stretched IRS"" to deal with this filing season, said former Commissioner of Internal Revenue Steven Miller, adding, ""This can't help.""Remember that big tax cut approved by Congress and the president? This is the first time it will be reflected in most people's tax returns. Miller said the IRS already had its hands full preparing for all the changes, updating its computer software and writing new paper forms.And while that work is likely being done by the IRS personnel who remain on the job, Miller said there is a lot of other work that isn't, including training in the new tax law for those who answer the IRS help line.""And even if the phones open,"" Miller said, whether those who answer the calls will be sufficiently trained to help taxpayers with questions ""is a real issue in my mind.""Another thing the IRS isn't doing now is conducting any audits or other types of enforcement. But Miller said the agency is still taking your money.""For example, if you paid your or are about to pay your Jan. 15 estimated tax payment as I did this past weekend,"" Miller said, ""they are more than happy to accept that money.""In 2018, the IRS paid more than $212 billion in refunds in the first three months of the year, an average of almost $2,900.Former Commissioner John Koskinen said for many folks, receiving a timely refund may not be a matter of life or death, but for some low-income taxpayers, their refund is a big deal, calling it ""the biggest financial event in the year"" for many.The IRS may decide to bring back some of its furloughed workers as the tax-filing season nears. But so far the agency has been been tight-lipped about its plans.The House plans to bring up a measure Tuesday to fund the agency through the rest of the fiscal year, a move likely to be opposed by Senate Republicans and the White House.The president is set to address the nation Tuesday night."

""I'm working on a historic orchard that was planted in the 1880s,"" he says. ""Heirloom trees."" But Seymour, a 62-year-old contractor with the National Park Service, has been out of work since Dec. 22. That's the day funding for the Interior Department and eight other federal departments ran out amid a political standoff between Congress and President Trump over his demand for money to build a wall along the border with Mexico. ""They sent e-mails out letting all of us know that work for them that we're furloughed until further notice,"" says Seymour. What's more, Seymour has little hope of being compensated for all the time he's being furloughed from his $35-an-hour job.  ""I know that the federal employees can get that,"" he says of the back pay that the 800,000 federal workers who've been idled or are working without pay expect once the shutdown ends. ""But in this case, since I don't work, I don't get paid. So I'm out of luck.""And so are many more of the 4.1 million people who New York University federal workforce expert Paul Light estimates work under federal contracts — estimates because, unlike for federal employees, there is no national database tracking the number of contract employees.""We've got a very large federal workforce with a majority of employees who are not on Uncle Sam's direct payroll,"" Light tells NPR. ""They will not get paid for this unpaid vacation, and I'm not sure how they'll recover if this shutdown continues much longer.""The shutdown has already upended Joe Pinnetti's plans for finishing his bachelor's degree in information technology while working days as an IT contractor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in western Massachusetts.  Pinnetti has been unable to perform his $22-an-hour job since the shutdown began.""It's going to be rough — I'm digging deep into my savings right now,"" says Pinnetti. ""The problem is I'm already having to sacrifice things to do so: I might have to take a semester off from school to rebuild my savings.""Thanks to the shutdown, Pinnetti has effectively joined the ranks of the unemployed. ""Like a lot of contractors, I am collecting unemployment as a way to cushion this,"" he says. ""But, you know, it's not enough to really make ends meet when you consider the cost of living, especially in a state like Massachusetts.""The 33-year-old IT specialist expects he'll be able to return to his job as a contract employee once the shutdown ends. But those who work for small firms with federal contracts may well find themselves out of a job.""That's where you would expect to see some pretty significant impacts of even a two-week shutdown,"" says NYU's Light, ""because the smaller the business, the more likely it is to lay off workers at the first sign that there might be a delay in payment."" Celeste Voigt knows how that feels. She has a vending concession for selling hot meals at two federal workplaces in South Dakota, both of which have been idled due to the shutdown. ""I tell them, go file for unemployment,"" she says of her four employees.  ""There's nothing else I can do — I mean, I have zero income. The difference between a government worker and me, even though they're not getting paid right now, they will get paid. I will never make up the money that I don't get. I'm just out.""Voigt, who's legally blind, worries her employees may not be coming back if the shutdown continues much longer. ""If it takes too long, they're going to look for other jobs. And now I'm going to be stuck with maybe no employees and I have to go back and look for good qualified employees to keep my businesses open. And that's not easy nowadays in this area.""President Trump has asserted that federal workers want the shutdown to continue until Congress provides funding to build a wall along the border.  For Voigt, that's a non-starter.""I don't know who he's talking to,"" she says with a laugh. ""I think anytime there's a government shutdown, whatever the reason, it's not appropriate.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/06/682686357/national-park-service-plans-to-expand-operations-amid-government-shutdown-degrad","In an unprecedented move, the National Park Service has decided to dip into entrance fee funds to pay for expanded operations during a government shutdown that has furloughed many of its workers.The decision comes after reports of degradation in the parks — trash thrown on the ground, human waste piling up, and visitors behaving irresponsibly by letting their dogs off leash or even driving off-road to do donuts in the desert.The revised contingency plan, obtained and reported by The Washington Post, did not specify how many agency employees would return to work, nor which parks would receive the additional staffing funds.In a press release earlier Sunday, the National Park Service said the funds would not be able to fully open parks, and that many of the smaller sites around the country will remain closed.""NPS will begin to use these funds to clean up trash that has built up at numerous parks, clean and maintain restrooms, bring additional law enforcement rangers into parks to patrol accessible areas, and to restore accessibility to areas that would typically be accessible this time of year,"" the agency wrote in the press release.Only 115 of the agency's 418 park sites collect entrance fees. The Washington Post reported that the Interior Department's acting secretary, David Bernhardt, asked for a list of parks that would expand their operations by using money from park fees and those that don't collect fees but have a demonstrated need for additional funds.The National Park Service move may violate appropriations law since park fees collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are designated towards visitor services, not towards operations and basic maintenance.An imperfect solutionSome park advocates, like Sabra Purdy, co-owner of a rock climbing guide service that operates in Joshua Tree National Park, worry that dipping into the park fees would deplete the funds for future park services.She said it was especially concerning given the fact that many of these parks have already lost a significant amount of park fee money — sometimes in the millions of dollars — by not collecting fees over the holiday season, when many of them have increased visitors.""If we allocate what fees have been collected before to this temporary stop gap emergency funding, we'll really be robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" she said. ""I don't think it's a great long term solution but I understand why people want to do it.""Ultimately, Purdy supports the move, although reluctant, because she would like to see park workers get paid and she thinks national parks could use the resources.As national parks have remained open yet understaffed over the past two weeks, Purdy and dozens of others across the country have volunteered to fill in for the missing workers.""I've been masquerading as a park service janitor for the last 16 days along with many, many other people,"" she said.Amid stories of heaps of human waste and garbage collecting in national parks, forcing some to close, these volunteers have kept some parks open and in pristine shape.""Toilet Paper Angels"" cleaned Joshua Tree National ParkThe first thing Purdy's husband and business co-owner Seth Zaharias did the morning after the partial government shutdown began on Dec. 22, was go to Walmart and spend $100 on toilet paper.Zaharias knew that one of the first problems with not having park service workers around would be the bathrooms.With no one to clean, empty and maintain the trashcans and bathrooms, Zaharias worried that trash — and human feces — would pile up and conditions would worsen to the point of shuttering the park. ""I knew a disaster was coming and I wasn't going to let the federal government ruin my home,"" he said.Purdy then posted on Facebook, inviting others to join them in cleaning the park, and it quickly grew into a grassroots volunteer movement.Now, the couple has an open meeting at their shop every morning where they organize the clean-up effort with anyone who shows up. On any given day, 10 to 50 people will show up. Last Saturday, 40 people came.Dubbed the ""Toilet Paper Angels,"" the volunteers working with Purdy, Zaharias and two local non-profits — Friends of Joshua's Tree and the Joshua Tree Climber's Collective — are bringing in hundreds of rolls of toilet paper into the park every day.The work they have to do in the bathrooms is far from divine.""I've seen multiple toilets covered in diarrhea,"" Zaharias said.In addition to cleaning and restocking the bathrooms, volunteers are also using trucks and trailers to haul trash out of overflowing dumpsters.""The trash would have been overflowing and blowing across the desert if it wasn't for the volunteers,"" Purdy said.In one day alone, Purdy said volunteers collectively hauled out about 4,000 pounds of trash.Situations worse in other parksFurther north, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks were closed due to unsanitary and unsafe conditions.Excessive human waste and overflowing trash also caused parts of Yosemite National Park to close last week, joining the ranks of hundreds of other closed parks. The partial closure spurred fear among those who rely on the park for their livelihood that Yosemite would be the next to be fully closed.Locals started posting on Facebook to organize park clean-ups. That's where Ken Yager, a climbing enthusiast who has lived in the area for over 42 years, stepped in to help.He happened to own over 700 litter sticks and countless garbage bags, gloves, and safety vests through his nonprofit organization, Yosemite Facelift, which does an annual organized volunteer cleanup in the park. So, last week he decided to hand them out to any willing volunteers.On the first day he handed out equipment, he estimates about 50 volunteers came. Though he recently got shoulder surgery, Yager's own love for the park pushed him to pitch in too.""I got one good shoulder, that's all I need,"" he said. ""Even in the past few days it looks a lot better, but there's other areas that still need a lot of work.""Before the cleanup, Yager said it was common to see fast-food containers chucked alongside the road and since bathrooms were closed at the park's entrance, piles of human feces in the forest.""A lot of people were going to the bathroom in the woods, and when you have 20,000 people a day, it piles up,"" he said.To fix the problem, local businesses donated port-a-potties to the park. Yager said many of the locals have a personal financial stake in the park.""The community depends on the park to make a living,"" he said. ""Everyone was already out for a month because of fires over the summer so this shutdown is already hurting.""Yager lives one mile from Yosemite, close enough to see snow falling in the valley. He has always been closely tied to the site; his business depends on cleaning National Park buildings inside the park.Over the years, he estimates he's experienced about eight shutdowns that affected Yosemite. However, he said the phenomenon of parks remaining open during a shutdown is relatively new for him. For shutdowns in 1995 and 2013, respectively, the Clinton and Obama administrations closed national parks completely.Yager prefers if national parks are kept open, but is grateful for the people who he said ""came running"" to help Yosemite stay open.Efforts to clean the park are not sustainableOften helping comes at a cost. For some, this cost is offset by the profits gained from keeping the park open — Utah's office of tourism is writing checks to maintain their most popular parks and New York City Governor Andrew Cuomo is spending $65,000 a day on the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.Cuomo said those landmarks bring in in a million dollars each day in tourism revenue.Sometimes the sacrifices aren't strictly monetary.While Zaharias and Purdy have been scrubbing toilets in Joshua Tree National Park, the irony is that between volunteering and running their business, they haven't had time to maintain the compost toilet in their own home.""Our personal toilet has gotten out of control"" Purdy said as she laughed. ""We haven't been able to use it.""Cleaning the parks is hard, unglamorous work, but Zaharias said that volunteers at Joshua Tree National Park are committed to continuing every day until the shutdown ends.""Not only is this the place that puts food on our table, but it's a place we hold sacred,"" he said.Realistically though, despite nearly $11,000 in donations to support their efforts, Zaharias estimated that volunteers can only sustain the amount of time and resources that they are pouring in for a few more weeks. Yager called the volunteers in Yosemite a ""temporary band-aid.""Volunteers also can't stop all the damage from potential visitors. Zaharias said he has seen tracks from vehicles going off-road, which damages the soil crust and has even seen visitors trying to haul the famous Joshua trees out of the Joshua Tree National Park.The news of the National Park Service's decision brought some relief to his wife. Purdy hopes that Joshua Tree National Park will be one of the ones chosen for additional staff resources.If it is, her wish is that National Park Service janitors will be some of the first staffers to come back to work.NPR's Rebecca Ellis contributed to this report."

He said negotiations would begin again on Monday, adding that he needed to deal directly with Democratic leaders.  Speaking with reporters outside of the White House, Trump said, ""We'll obviously be discussing the wall, which is desperately needed ... We have to build a wall, we have to build a barrier. The barrier, or the wall, can be made of steel instead of concrete in case that helps people.""Talks have remained at an impasse over the president's funding request for the wall. Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for the construction of a fence and border security. The president has said he will not budge on the money he is requesting. ""This is a very important battle to win, in terms of safety, number one, defining our country, and who we are,"" Trump said. On Sunday, Trump threatened again to declare a national emergency to build the wall along the U.S. Mexico border if he could not reach a deal with Democratic congressional leaders. The negotiations are continuing as a partial government shutdown has left more than 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay.  ""Many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I am doing,"" Trump said on Sunday. As the president continues to press his case for the wall, Democrats, newly in the majority in the House of Representatives, said they would seek passage of individual appropriations bills to force some parts of the government to reopen. A statement from the House Appropriations Committee, chaired by New York Democrat Nita Lowey, read: Last week, President Trump warned that the partial government shutdown could continue for months and even years if he is not able to reach a deal with Democrats.

A sticking point remains President Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build a border wall. Democrats say they will not agree to any additional money for a wall, and that the government should re-open while negotiations continue. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi released a statement that next week Democrats will ""begin passing individual appropriations bills to re-open all government agencies, starting with the appropriations bill that covers the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. This action is necessary so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""Vice President Mike Pence, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and senior presidential adviser Jared Kushner were among the officials at Saturday's meeting. Pence maintained that funding for the border wall is needed, and that the White House will not budge in its request for funding for the wall. As negotiations continue, more than 800,000 federal employees are working without pay or have been furloughed. On Saturday the Transportation Security Administration told NPR there has been a small increase in the number of employees calling in sick, but that there has been no impact on wait times at airports. TSA spokesperson Michael Bilello said, ""The actual statistics at [Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport], if on a normal day, 3.5 percent of that workforce called out for any number of reasons, they are sick, they have a personal issue, or perhaps they are stressed about the uncertainty in the lapse of funding, whatever it is, if on a normal day it's 3.5 percent, yesterday it was 5.5 percent."" Thomas Schoregge, union representative for the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2222 with jurisdiction over New Jersey and New York, told NPR the number of federal employees calling in sick to work could increase if the shutdown continues, ""If the majority of people live paycheck-to-paycheck what's going to happen once their money runs out?"" He said TSA employees should keep showing up for work while negotiations proceed in Washington. ""We've been through this before. This is not our first shutdown,"" Schoregge said. ""We know what's going to happen. We know what it entails. Come to work and do your job."" For some federal workers, such as a TSA employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job, coming to work may be increasingly difficult as the shutdown continues.The employee told NPR, ""The rumor was brewing that maybe the next paycheck we'll see is the 25th. I know for myself, it's going to be challenging to hold onto the 25th, for a paycheck. I've already had to take some drastic steps in my life. I've had to dip into what little savings I have to try and pay off my credit cards, and close those out because I don't know when's the next time I am going to be able to pay them. I've taken out money to cover insurance policies for the rest of the year. Whatever money I had for the future, I have to use it for this situation now, because I don't know what's going to happen.""Congressional staff and White House officials will meet again on Sunday afternoon to try and hammer out a deal.

""Absolutely I said that,"" adding, ""I don't think it will"" last that long, ""but I'm prepared.""He also maintained that the two sides had a ""very, very productive meeting"" and that ""I think we've come a long, long way.""Vice President Pence said he, White House adviser Jared Kushner and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would meet with congressional staffers over the weekend. ""This is national security,"" Trump said in a sometimes-rambling news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday. ""We're not playing games — we have to do it.""Trump remains dug in on his refusal to sign any funding bill that does not include $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats remain insistent they will not provide the votes to give him that funding.The president threatened that he could use emergency powers to bypass Congress to build the wall. ""We could call a national emergency and build it very quickly,"" Trump said, but added that ""if we can do it through a negotiated process, that's better.""Trump ruled out reopening other parts of the government while the two sides negotiate over the wall, saying he didn't want to do it piecemeal.He was asked about the impact of the shutdown on the 800,000 federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown.  ""This has a higher purpose than next week's pay,"" he said, adding that many of those affected ""are the biggest fans"" of his insistence on the wall.Several Cabinet members and the vice president are scheduled to receive pay raises of up to $10,000 annually under previous legislation. Trump said he ""may consider"" asking his Cabinet to forgo those raises for now.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later issued a statement calling the issue ""another unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown"" and saying the administration is ""exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed."" Pelosi said Friday, ""We really cannot resolve this until we open up government, and we made that very clear to the president."" Democrats took control of the House of Representatives this week and elected Pelosi to a post she first held from 2007 to 2011. In one of the first acts of the new Congress, the House passed a short-term bill funding the Department of Homeland Security for about a month and a measure providing money for every other federal department or agency currently without funding through the rest of the fiscal year, which goes through September. The Homeland Security bill does not include Trump's border wall demands. It passed on a 239-192 vote, with five House Republicans backing it. The broader bill passed 241-190, with seven GOP members voting for it.Pelosi has framed the measures as a ""Republican"" solution to the impasse, because they mirror the spending bill the GOP-controlled Senate unanimously passed and sent to the House last month, before Trump reversed course and insisted that any funding bill include wall money. Trump has issued a veto threat for the two bills. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate will not consider them, because he only wants to call a vote on a funding measure Trump would sign. Friday's White House meeting included Pelosi and the rest of the so-called ""Big 8"": the top two leaders from all four House and Senate caucuses. Congressional leaders met with Trump on Wednesday, but also left with little sign of progress."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/04/682061603/government-shutdown-may-hamper-alaskas-lucrative-fishing-industry","The partial federal government shutdown is casting uncertainty over the major fishing industry based in the Bering Sea, which has an annual catch valued at more than $1 billion.January marks the opening of a number of major fisheries in Alaska, including the 3 billion pounds of pollock that will be processed into fish sticks and McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. And while the openings are set to go forward as scheduled, some of the boats and one entire fishing fleet are still missing federal permits and inspections needed before they can leave the docks.The shutdown has closed down much of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which oversees the Bering Sea fisheries. People working in the industry say they're not sure if or when boats will be able to get the needed authorizations.""My understanding is the vessels that have not been certified yet will not be certified until the government opens up again,"" said Haukur Johannesson, whose company, Marel, provides scales that weigh fish to the huge factory vessels that work in the Bering Sea. ""And if they don't get certified, they cannot go fishing.""Many of the Bering Sea fishing boats, however, are huge factory trawlers owned by sophisticated, Seattle-based companies, with lobbyists who know how to navigate the world of Congress and federal agencies. For example, officials at Romanzof Fishing Co. initially feared the shutdown would thwart one of their boats from taking a Jan. 1 trip to catch crab, since fisheries service employees were unavailable for a required inspection.But by Thursday, the inspection had gone ahead and the company was back out fishing, according to Doug Wells, who works in government affairs for Romanzof.The companies that will start fishing for pollock Jan. 20, meanwhile, can lease their fishing quotas between different boats if some vessels are sidelined by the shutdown, says Jim Gilmore, a spokesman for a pollock industry trade group. Nonetheless, he says, his group's 15 boats each have crews of more than 100 onboard that are already prepared for the trip from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands. Companies have stocked food and fuel. The cost of uncertainty""I think the fish will get caught one way or another,"" Gilmore says. But, he adds: ""It's dealing with the practicalities of taking a $60 million fishing vessel with a crew of 130 people and taking it up to a very remote location and trying to make all that come together in a cost-effective way.""The potential for shutdown-related effects on the Bering Sea fisheries stems from their tight regulation by the federal government.The fisheries service certifies scales used to weigh fish, as well as monitoring equipment aboard boats that ensures companies comply with regulations. The fisheries service also trains and debriefs independent observers who ride along on boats to collect data.The Alaska-based spokesperson for the fisheries service, Julie Speegle, is not in the office during the shutdown, according to an outgoing message on her voicemail. The agency's law enforcement office is still working and could cite companies that try to fish without required authorizations, according to an email from Sitka-based enforcement agent Al Duncan. But other activities like scale inspections aren't taking place, he wrote.The fisheries service is still holding required training classes for observers, says Stacey Hansen, program manager at Saltwater, an Anchorage-based observer company.But, she adds, the fisheries service is not holding ""debriefings"" for observers when they return from a fishing trip, which are required before those observers can go on their next trips. Hansen says that delay has sidelined five of her employees.""I've got a group of people that are now stuck,"" she says. ""These people are in purgatory; they're in limbo. They're just sitting and waiting until they can get on with their lives.""Another shutdown-related problem is threatening to derail an entire fleet of large factory boats that catch groundfish like mackerel and yellowfin sole, in a season that also opens Jan. 20.The five companies and 19 boats in the fleet were planning to fish cooperatively this year. But they need a permit to do so, and as of last week, the fisheries service was unable to issue it, according to an internal email sent by Chris Woodley, the director of the fleet's trade group.""No permit = no fishing,"" Woodley wrote in his email, sent to members of the fleet on Dec. 28, 2018.Woodley says the permit still hadn't been issued as of Thursday. The wholesale value of his fleet's catch is roughly $350 million a year."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/04/681995105/private-companies-are-paying-to-keep-roads-groomed-bathrooms-cleaned-in-yellowst","Two weeks into the government shutdown, National Parks are starting to close. The public has been getting free access, since there are no employees to collect entrance fees of up to $35 per car. But neither are employees there to collect trash and clean bathrooms. So, with overflowing trash cans and toilets posing a threat to human health and safety, parks are shutting down.But in the nation's oldest national park, Yellowstone, local businesses are pitching in to pay park staff to keep it open — or at least parts of it.Temperatures in the park regularly drop below zero this time of year, and the park is blanketed in snow. But still, between 20,000 to 30,000 people a month still come to Yellowstone in wintertime, and the snow is actually a big attraction.Snowmobiles are as common as cars on the frozen streets of the park gateway town of West Yellowstone, Mont. Dan Gibbons from nearby Bozeman had family in from out of town for the holidays, and booked a snowmobile tour from here to Old Faithful geyser.The best part of his trip, he said, was seeing the kids' reaction to the sights.""The trees next to the geysers are covered in ice crystals, I could show you some pictures, it's brilliant!"" he laughed.Jerry Johnson owns a business that rents snowmobiles and sends seven guided tours a day into Yellowstone in the winter. He calls it 'the trip of a lifetime.' When the shutdown began, he received a big spike in phone calls from people who had already booked trips, and he didn't want to tell them their Yellowstone adventure was cancelled because politicians in Washington D.C. couldn't resolve their differences.""I mean it's not cheap,"" Johnson said, ""They had to plan and budget for this, and to all of a sudden get the carpet ripped out from underneath them, I think is not fair.""The park is almost entirely closed to cars starting in November, so the only way to get to Old Faithful and most of the other park attractions is via snowmobile, or in big vans with cartoonishly huge balloon tires called snowcoaches. They require roads that are groomed daily by the park's fleet of half-a-dozen big tractors — kind of like the Zambonis that smooth out ice skating rinks, but a lot bigger.""If you don't groom,"" explained Johnson, ""the trails will get very rough, and you get bumps, moguls, in them, and it'll be — it's just miserable.""So, during the shutdown, private businesses that operate inside the park are picking up the tab — about $7,500 dollars a day to groom Yellowstone's 300-plus miles of snow-covered roads, and to keep one paved road open to cars. Xanterra Parks and Resorts, which runs the only hotels operating inside the park in winter, is paying most of that — paying park service employees to perform the same grooming duties they do under normal circumstances.Xanterra asked the 13 guide services that operate in the park to chip in to help pay, and all of them did. It adds up to about 300 bucks a day for each of the guide services.And will the Park Service reimburse them for paying park employees during the shutdown? ""There is no reimbursement from the government after the shutdown ends,"" says Mike Keller, Xanterra's general manager in Yellowstone, ""The funds that we pay operate for those days. We won't be reimbursed the dollars that we've committed for the previous 14 days.""Nor is Xanterra getting reimbursed for the half-dozen of its own employees who are cleaning park bathrooms during the shutdown. Snowmobile guide services like Jerry Johnson's are packing in their own toilet paper, and packing out all their trash. Johnson says they're happy to keep the park open and clean.""It should be open, and services should be there, because it is the people's park,"" he says.Xanterra Resorts says they're willing to keep paying park employees to maintain winter access to Yellowstone into February, at which time they'll re-evaluate the funding arrangement with their fellow concessionaires."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/03/681982370/how-the-federal-shutdown-is-affecting-health-programs","There seems to be no end in sight for the current partial government shutdown, the third since the beginning of the Trump administration.For the vast majority of the federal government's public health efforts, though, it's business as usual.That's because Congress has already passed five of its major appropriations bills, funding about three-fourths of the federal government, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs.But seven bills are outstanding — including those that fund the Interior, Agriculture and Justice departments — and that puts the squeeze on some important health-related initiatives.The shutdown itself isn't about health policies. It's the result of differences of opinion between the administration and congressional Democrats regarding funding for President Trump's border wall. But it's far-reaching, nonetheless. Here's where things stand:Funding for ""big ticket"" health programs is already in place, alleviating much of the shutdown's immediate potential impactSince HHS funding is set through September, the flagship government health care programs — think Obamacare, Medicare and Medicaid — are insulated.That's also true of public health surveillance, like tracking the flu virus, a responsibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Institutes of Health, which oversees major biomedical research, is also fine. It's a stark contrast to last January's shutdown, which sent home about half of HHS's staff.But some other public health operations are vulnerable because of complicated funding streams Although the Food and Drug Administration falls under the HHS umbrella, it receives significant funding for its food safety operations through the spending bill for the Department of Agriculture, which is entirely caught up in the shutdown.Last year, that tallied an estimated $2.9 billion to support among other things these FDA oversight efforts, which involve everything from food recalls to routine facility inspections and cosmetics regulation. Not having those dollars now means, according to the FDA contingency plan, that about 40 percent of the agency — thousands of government workers — is furloughed.The FDA will continue work that's critical to public health and safety. It will be able to respond to emergencies, like the flu and foodborne illnesses. It will continue recalls of any foods, drugs and medical devices that pose a high risk to human health. The FDA's responsibilities for drug approval and oversight are funded by user fees and will continue product reviews where the fees have already been paid. Regulation of tobacco products is also continuing.Health services for Native Americans are also on holdBecause Congress has yet to approve funding for the Indian Health Service, which is run by HHS but gets its money through the Department of the Interior, IHS feels the full weight of the shutdown. The only services that can continue are those that meet ""immediate needs of the patients, medical staff, and medical facilities,"" according to the shutdown contingency plan.That includes IHS-run clinics, which provide direct health care to tribes around the country. These facilities are open, and many staffers are reporting to work because they are deemed ""excepted,"" said Jennifer Buschik, an agency spokeswoman. But they will not be paid until Congress and the administration reach a deal.Other IHS programs are taking a more direct hit. For example, the agency has suspended grants that support tribal health programs as well as preventive health clinics run by the Office of Urban Indian Health Programs.Public health efforts by Homeland Security and the EPA face serious constraintsThe Department of Homeland Security's Office of Health Affairs assesses threats posed by infectious diseases, pandemics and biological and chemical attacks. It is supposed to be scaling back, according to the department's shutdown contingency plan. This office is just one component of the 204-person Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is retaining about 65 employees during the funding gap.Other DHS health workers are likely to work without pay — for instance, health inspectors at the border, said Peter Boogaard, who was an agency spokesman under the Obama administration. According to DHS's plan, the vast majority of Border Patrol employees will continue working through the shutdown.The Environmental Protection Agency has also run out of funding. According to its contingency plan, it's keeping on more than 700 employees without pay, including those who work on Superfund sites or other activities where the ""threat to life or property is imminent."" (More than 13,000 EPA workers have been furloughed.)That limits the agency's capacity for activities including inspecting water that people drink and regulating pesticides.But it's not just regulation. The public health stakes are visceral — and sometimes, frankly, pretty gross.Just look at the National Park Service, which has halted restroom maintenance and trash service for lack of funding. On Sunday, Yosemite National Park in California closed its campgrounds. On Wednesday, Joshua Tree National Park, also in California, did the same.Why? Per a park service press release: ""The park is being forced to take this action for health and safety concerns as vault toilets reach capacity.""Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

FridayThe government shutdown began with the president's demand for border security money. But it has also halted E-Verify, a federal program that's supposed to prevent immigrants from working here illegally.If U.S. employers want to check whether their prospective hires are eligible to work, they can't. The E-Verify database is ""currently unavailable due to a lapse in government appropriations,"" according to a note on the government-run website.""There's an irony there,"" says Julie Pace, an attorney specializing in employment and immigration law at Cavanagh Law Firm in Phoenix. ""We have an electronic wall for E-Verify that should be being used, that the government has not funded.""The E-Verify outage is just one way the government shutdown is taking a toll on the U.S. immigration system.President Trump has demanded $5 billion for a border wall, leading to a budget impasse and a partial government shutdown that has affected some Department of Homeland Security operations.Border Patrol agents at the Southwest border are working, but they won't get paid until the shutdown ends. So are tens of thousands of other immigration agents in DHS.""They are angry, they are scared,"" said Tony Reardon, the head of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 30,000 Customs and Border Protection officers.""They are doing the work of this country, not knowing whether they are going to be able to put food on the table,"" Reardon said. ""The morale is as low as I have ever seen it.""Much of the nation's immigration court system is closed, adding to a backlog of more than 800,000 cases and counting.""We've never been in a situation that is so dire with regard to the backlog of immigration cases nationwide,"" immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told NPR's All Things Considered. Marks is former president of the National Association of Immigration Judges and one of many judges who have been furloughed during the shutdown.""When we have to shut down, those cases are delayed, sometimes for years, before we have space on our dockets to be able to reschedule them,"" said Marks.Some immigration judge are working without pay, but they're only hearing cases where the immigrant is in detention.""People are totally confused about what to do about showing up or not showing up,"" said Heena Arora, an immigration lawyer in Queens, New York.Arora says some of her clients waited for years for hearings in the backlogged immigration courts. But when their day came, the hearings weren't held because of the shutdown.""We don't know when it's going to be rescheduled for. It could be rescheduled for next month. It could be rescheduled for next year or even a couple of years later. So we have no idea,"" Arora said. ""It sucks. It sucks for them, and it sucks for me. Because I have no work this week.""Employers across the country are also grappling with uncertainty about the E-Verify system.""At first, people thought it was a day or two or three. Now we're into two weeks,"" said Julie Pace, the lawyer in Phoenix. Employers can get in big trouble for knowingly hiring undocumented workers. And Arizona is one of several states where they are required to use E-Verify. The longer the shutdown lasts, Pace says, the more she is fielding panicked calls and emails from employers.""Now the calls are, we've gotta on board these people. So we're just gonna move forward,"" Pace said. ""Can we do that?""Some employers will probably go ahead and hire people anyway, Pace says. Others will wait until the shutdown is over. And some may even speed up hiring to get people through the process while E-Verify is down.Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that operates E-Verify, say that the ""three-day rule"" for creating new E-Verify cases is suspended while the system is down. ""USCIS has taken a number of steps to minimize the burden on both employees and employers, who can continue to hire, and we look forward to program services once again being fully functioning to the benefit of all Americans,"" said USCIS Spokesman Michael Bars in a statement.""Those forcing a government shutdown in order to protest border security only hurt the interests of the people they're supposed to put first,"" Bars added.Despite the E-Verify outage and other issues, immigration hard-liners think it would be a mistake for the president to back down from his demands for a border wall now.""There's a bigger point that both the president and the Democrats are trying to make,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration.Krikorian is a big fan of E-Verify. He'd like the program to be mandatory all over the country. But if it has to be shut down for a few weeks to make a point, Krikorian says, so be it.""It's unfortunate,"" Krikorian said. ""But it's just part of the larger problem of having this kind of game of chicken over policy questions."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/03/681727613/pelosi-poised-to-retake-gavel-as-house-speaker-with-new-session-of-congress","Updated at 3:46 p.m. ETNancy Pelosi is again speaker of the House, as Democrats retook control of the chamber for the first time in eight years, bringing divided government back to Washington.The first woman to hold the position, Pelosi is now the first person to reclaim the speaker's gavel in more than six decades.The California Democrat was elected with 220 votes over California Republican Kevin McCarthy, the new minority leader.After accepting the speaker's gavel from McCarthy, Pelosi said the nation is at ""an historic moment."" And while not mentioning President Trump by name, Pelosi said voters spoke last November, calling on ""the beauty of our Constitution, our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy.""Pelosi said she was ""particularly proud"" to return as speaker now, in the 100th year of women having the right to vote, presiding over more than 100 women in Congress, the highest number in history.With the start of the new Congress, nearly 100 newly elected lawmakers are coming to the House and Senate — including those representing the 40 seats the Democrats picked up to sweep their party back into power in the House.They will be led by Pelosi, who, with Thursday's vote, returns to the job of speaker after eight years leading Democrats in the minority. Pelosi made the history books in 2007 when she became the first woman elected speaker, and on Thursday, she became the first person to return to that job since Sam Rayburn in 1955.Pelosi took the gavel in the midst of a nearly two-week partial government shutdown over President Trump's demand for more than $5 billion to build a wall on the Southwest border with Mexico. Democrats plan to launch their new majority with votes on a package of bills to end the shutdown and reform the rules of the House.The first day of the new Congress is always a festive occasion, and Thursday's opening session was no different. Lawmakers brought along spouses and their children, many of whom surrounded Pelosi as she was sworn in as speaker.She said the House will ""debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from"" and noted that the spending bill that is to get a vote late on Thursday had been supported by Senate Republicans.She outlined an ambitious agenda for the next two years, saying the House will address income disparity and be ""a champion of the middle class,"" protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as people with pre-existing medical conditions and face what she called ""the existential threat of our time, the climate crisis.""She also pledged the House will act on guns by passing ""bipartisan background check legislation,"" will pass the Equality Act to end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, and will protect those she called ""our patriotic, courageous DREAMers,"" young immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children.Pelosi promised the 116th Congress will be ""transparent, bipartisan and unifying,"" saying that ""the floor of this House must be America's Town Hall: where the people will see our debates, and where their voices will be heard and affect our decisions.""The vote to reopen government is expected to sail through with a majority of Democrats supporting six bipartisan spending bills that fund most of the closed agencies through September and a short-term extension of current funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Pelosi said the legislation gives Republicans a chance to reopen government and to keep working on border security, which is funded through DHS.That party unity may begin to crack when it came to the new House rules. A small group of progressives, including California Rep. Ro Khanna and incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said they'll vote against the rules. They object to a provision that would require Congress to offset new spending through a provision called pay as you go, or PAYGO.Traditional budget economists and incoming House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Democrats can, and often do, waive the rule Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna oppose. Progressives are divided on the issue. Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairs, Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Mark Pocan D-Wis., said they will support the rules package despite the budgeting concern.""Chairman McGovern and House Leadership have committed to us that PAYGO will not be an impediment to advancing key progressive priorities in the 116th Congress,"" the co-chairs said in a statement. ""With the assurances that PAYGO can be waived, we do plan to vote for the House rules package and proceed with legislation to fix the statute.""The fight over rules will be the first of likely many intraparty squabbles among Democrats as they try to satisfy the demands of an ideologically and demographically diverse coalition.Other rules changes included in the package could significantly affect how the House operates. One revives a rule that would automatically raise the nation's borrowing authority once a budget is approved — lowering the threat of partisan confrontations about the debt ceiling. Another changes the process for attempts to force out a sitting House speaker. And Democrats also plan to vow lawmakers will get 72 hours to review any legislation before it gets a floor vote."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/02/681712888/despite-huge-backlogs-the-government-shutdown-halts-most-immigration-court-heari","The federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.Court appointments scheduled during the shutdown will be ""reset"" to new dates in the future, per a notice from the Department of Justice dated Dec. 26. The only exception are courts operating in immigration detention centers, where federal immigration authorities hold immigrants pending deportation. However, court staff may not be paid while continuing to hear those cases.In addition, some emergency motions in nondetained cases can still be filed to the judges that are working during the shutdown.Shutting down the country's massive system of immigration courts will gum up an already congested judicial process, immigration judges and attorneys say.In federal immigration court, judges often hear cases in quick succession, a process some have compared to hearing ""death penalty cases heard in traffic court settings."" A swift deportation may become a death sentence if a person is forced to return to a violent homeland.Each day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in Los Angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.""We don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled,"" she said.Calls to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.In recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the U.S. has swelled, as processing times lagged. The average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles statistics on U.S. immigration. That's up from 430 days a decade ago.Some administration officials and immigration hard-liners have criticized long processing times as contributing to practices that allow immigrants without strong cases to stay in the U.S. for years, rather than be swiftly deported.To try to move cases through more quickly, the Trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. However, under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. If reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.Both policies drew criticism from judges such as Tabaddor, who called the quotas ""indefensible"" and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.""It's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration,"" she said, referring to President Trump's desire for funding additional barriers at U.S.-Mexico border.It's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.""Rescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. For others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise,"" said Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz.For example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. Or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the U.S. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.""Every immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case,"" said Philadelphia immigration attorney Matthew Archambeault. In either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.""The thing I tell them is, something's going on, their hearings may not go forward, but to prepare like they're going to go forward,"" said Archambeault. ""I don't get into it too much."""

The Smithsonian relied on funds from previous years to stay open through the first of the year, but planned to close its doors on Jan. 2 if the government shutdown continued. The animals continue to be cared for.""It's really disappointing for our public because we know so many people come to Washington with plans to visit the Smithsonian museums, which are free,"" Smithsonian spokesperson Linda St. Thomas told WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons. ""And they really plan on that being a part of their visit to the city.""Leave no trace: About two weeks into the shutdown, garbage and human waste are piling up in Yosemite National Park, The Los Angeles Times reported. The park has stayed open since the shutdown began, making do with fewer resources, like restrooms. Without access to restrooms, some park visitors are relieving themselves outside, but they aren't following the park services' recommendation to pack and carry out or bury their solid waste. As a result, some areas of the park, including ""all snow play areas,"" have been closed.""It's a free-for-all,"" Dakota Snider, who lives in Yosemite Valley, told The Associated Press on Monday. ""It's so heartbreaking. There is more trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I've seen in my four years living here.""Yosemite isn't the only park affected by the shutdown; trash and toilets are a problem in Joshua Tree and Pinnacles National Park in California, and at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Other parks like Arches and Canyonlands in Utah and Yellowstone National Park have announced full or partial closures because of personnel shortages. And beware of checking nps.org for updates; the website won't be updated during the shutdown.Loans lost: Several government agencies that give out loans have had their purse strings tied by the federal shutdown. NPR's Shannon Van Sant reported last month that new housing development grants and housing quality inspections may be delayed. So could loans for new homebuyers.The Small Business Administration also won't be able to process loan applications that startups and small-business owners use to get funding, USA Today reports.The Department of Agriculture also announced last week that it won't be issuing any new rural development loans, which are designed to aid home, business and utility development in rural areas.Pinching pennies: Visitors to Washington, D.C., might notice that a few local businesses are trying to help ease some of the financial stress — or at least the emotional stress — of the shutdown.In the capital, some restaurants are offering deals on food to anyone with a government employee ID. Celebrity chef José Andres promised a free sandwich for furloughed federal workers at any of his D.C. restaurants, NPR's Bobby Allyn reported.Capitol Lounge even released a menu of shutdown-themed cocktails, including a vodka-based ""Nothing Really Mattis"" and a tequila-infused ""Border Wall Banger."""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said it was up to Democratic leaders to cut a deal with Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The partial shutdown is the third time the government was shuttered in 2018.Monday, Dec. 24The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst Christmas Eve performance in history, dropping 2.9 percent in just a half day of trading. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 index fell more than 2 percent on the day.The volatile day on Wall Street followed an unusual public statement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in which he said he spoke with the CEOs of the six largest banks in the country and was assured of their lending capacity.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Trump spent the day posting a flurry of tweets, including an attack on the Federal Reserve, a thank you message to Saudi Arabia and several thoughts about the border wall.Trump also tweeted that he was ""alone"" in the White House and waiting on Democrats to make a deal with him on funding the southern border wall.That evening, Trump and first lady Melania Trump participated in NORAD's annual Santa tracking event.In a clip that soon went viral on Twitter, Trump could be heard asking one young girl calling for an update on Santa's whereabouts: ""Are you still a believer in Santa? Because at 7, it's marginal, right?""The girl, later identified by the Charleston Post and Courier as 7-year-old Collman Lloyd of Lexington, S.C., said she still believes in Santa after the phone call with Trump — while noting she had never heard the word ""marginal"" before.Tuesday, Dec. 25Trump took to Twitter Christmas evening to wish a Merry Christmas to ""everyone, even the Fake News Media."" Earlier in the day, he made phone calls to U.S. service members stationed overseas and, afterward, vented to reporters about Democrats and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey.""It's a disgrace, what's happening in our country,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""On the same day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced that an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala had died in U.S. custody, the second child in December to die in custody after being apprehended by the CBP.Immigration and Customs Enforcement also drew attention as the agency continued releasing hundreds of asylum-seeking migrants near a bus station in El Paso, Texas. Outgoing Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke responded to ICE's action by tweeting a call for donations for the families the agency released.Wednesday, Dec. 26The day after Christmas was a busy one. Here are the highlights:Thursday, Dec. 27It became clear the partial government shutdown would last into the new year after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., advised members that no votes were expected in the House for the remainder of the week. Neither Trump nor Democratic leaders showed signs of backing down, each issuing statements blaming the other for the shutdown.One consequence of the continued shutdown: The Smithsonian announced it would close all of its museums and the National Zoo on Jan. 2 unless a spending deal could be reached.Friday, Dec. 28Nielsen traveled to the southern U.S. border after the deaths of two migrant children in U.S. custody, citing an ""unprecedented"" increase in the number of families and children being apprehended.On Twitter, Trump again threatened to close the border with Mexico; the president also said he will cut off aid to a trio of Central American countries. O'Rourke took to Twitter to take on Trump's proposed border wall in a video that racked up 5 million views in 72 hours.The partial government shutdown stretched into its sixth day on Friday, and government workers living paycheck to paycheck began worrying about their ability to pay the bills should the shutdown continue.Saturday, Dec. 29Trump again took to Twitter to chide Democrats for not agreeing to his demands for border wall funding. The president also said on Twitter that ""Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies....""Trump also claimed ""big progress"" was being made on a deal with China as the trade war between the two countries continues.As New Year's Day approached, more effects of the partial shutdown became apparent. For example, a group of volunteers descended on Joshua Tree National Park to scrub toilets, restock toilet paper and clean trash in place of National Park Service employees. The Environmental Protection Agency also announced it would halt its operations.Monday, Dec. 31Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she would form an exploratory committee — essentially launching her 2020 presidential campaign. She made the announcement in a video emailed to supporters, touting her work on consumer financial protections and vowing that Trump could be defeated in 2020.In Capitol Hill news, a Democratic leadership aide said the House of Representatives will vote on a bill to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday — the day Democrats take control of the chamber. The bill will include full-year appropriations for six of the seven outstanding funding bills and temporary stopgap funding for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8.And on Wall Street, all three major stock market indexes closed 2018 down for the year.As 2018 drew to a close, our political journalists looked back on some of the most important stories of the year, including:Tuesday, Jan. 1As 2019 begins, there are multiple big cases still unresolved in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — and more charges could be on the way.Trump begins the new year with a host of key advisers and top administration officials departing from their positions, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, chief of staff John Kelly, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and chief of staff to the vice president Nick Ayers."

Nancy Pelosi, who is set to take over as speaker, wrote that the president ""has given Democrats a great opportunity to show how we will govern responsibly & quickly pass our plan to end the irresponsible #TrumpShutdown.""Trump has insisted on $5.7 billion for a southern border wall, but Democratic congressional leaders have stood firm against the funding.The House is expected to vote on a funding bill to end the partial government shutdown on Thursday. That's the first day of the new Congress, when Democrats will take control of the chamber and are expected to elect Pelosi as speaker.According to Pelosi, the legislation will include the full-year appropriations for six of the seven outstanding funding bills. And it would provide stopgap funding until Feb. 8 for the Department of Homeland Security, which is where the fight over border wall funding is contained.""It is important to note that these bills contain no new wall funding,"" Pelosi said in a letter Tuesday to Democratic House members. Sanders said the Democrats ""so far have refused to compromise"" and called Pelosi's plan a ""non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime.""About 800,000 federal employees are furloughed during the partial shutdown or are working without pay. On Friday, Trump issued an executive order freezing the salary rates for civilian federal workers.NPR's Scott Detrow contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/31/681228933/as-government-shutdown-drags-on-so-do-economic-worries","Ten days into the partial government shutdown, it's time to ask a dreaded question: What if this keeps going?A new congressional session begins Thursday, at which time Democrats become the majority in the House. There's no indication that progress will be made before then on the political standoff over funding a border wall that President Trump is demanding.What's running — and what isn't — during the shutdownNine federal departments and agencies are affected by the shutdown, including Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, State, Transportation and the Treasury.But the entire government isn't closed, and many of its parts are still functioning. The Department of Veterans Affairs tweeted a reminder that payments to veterans are unaffected by the shutdown. Social Security checks will keep being sent. And at least for the month of January, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits will still be distributed to eligible households.The U.S. Postal Service, an independent agency, is unaffected and notes that its operations are funded not by taxes, but by the sale of postage and other products and services.The Department of Agriculture released a list of activities that will and won't continue during a shutdown that continues into the new year. Some things that will not be affected: meat, poultry and egg inspection, as well as Forest Service law enforcement and emergency and natural disaster response. School lunch programs will continue into February. Other domestic nutrition assistance programs, such as WIC (Women, Infants, and Children), can continue to operate with any state and local funding that's available, but won't receive federal funds during the shutdown.However, recreational sites operated by the U.S. Forest Service will be closed, unless an external group has stepped in to fill the void left by the absence of federal employees. USDA Farm Service Agency offices have already closed. There won't be provisioning of new rural development loans and grants, and there won't be new timber sales.Wildfire response is being affected, too. Kait Hess is an emergency response planner at the Environmental Protection Agency in Philadelphia. Her office has been deploying personnel to support wildfire cleanup response in California. ""The personnel being deployed are exempt from the shutdown, but the fact that we can't man our [Emergency Operations Center] to support our people who are going — in the event they have any questions or concerns — is unsettling,"" Hess tells NPR. If the shutdown drags on, it may be difficult for her office to make its next round of deployments to help with wildfire cleanup.How federal workers are affectedAbout 800,000 workers are affected by the shutdown.Julie Burr, who works as an administrative assistant in the Department of Transportation and is a single mom, told NPR's All Things Considered that she has picked up a second job to get through the shutdown.""That's only about 25 percent of my pay that I make at my federal job, so it's not going to pay all of my bills, obviously,"" she said. And because she's a contractor, she's unlikely to get any back pay once the shutdown ends. ""I guess the drastic thing would be to start taking back Christmas gifts or, you know, maybe selling things,"" Burr said. ""I don't know. I hope it doesn't come to that.""Chris Kendrick is an IT specialist at the USDA in Columbia, Mo. He told NPR that he and his wife are anxious about a long shutdown. ""Since I will get my next check, we should be OK,"" he wrote. ""But the issue will be the next two weeks and on as I then won't have a check coming. We do have savings, but with the holidays, and I had a short stay in the hospital, I expect some large bills soon. ""Further, while often federal employees receive back pay, I've no confidence this will be the case when we do return to work,"" Kendrick says. ""Finally, while focus has been with federal employees, what is not mentioned is the impact to contractors and vendors. Contractors often are forced to take vacation, and if not, are simply unpaid with no back pay at all.""In Ventura, Calif., Kristie Scarazzo works as a botanist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — her dream job, for which she recently drained her savings account to move to the area. She told NPR's Weekend Edition she's very worried about a longer shutdown. To prepare, she filled out a state unemployment application. ""I've never had public assistance before. So I have, you know, mixed feelings about that.""Scarazzo wants lawmakers to know that the shutdown affects the lives of ordinary people.""I think, at the end of the day, you know, we just have to remember that there are individuals that are trying to make it work and support their families,"" she says. ""You know, there's a lot of people that take great pride in being a public servant and being able to do the jobs that we do. And it's just an unfortunate situation.""What about the economy?Economists say the impact on the larger economy won't be large, as long as the shutdown ends soon. That's partly because the shutdown has spanned a holiday period when government work is generally quiet. A longer shutdown could affect consumer spending, as federal employees continue to be furloughed or work without pay. Sharon Stiteler is a park ranger for the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, and she's been through four government shutdowns. ""Sometimes at 2 a.m., I might have a bit of a panic attack that, you know, I'm not a useful contributor to my household,"" she told All Things Considered. ""And, my goodness, maybe I should not have bought the more expensive lettuce today. Who knows how much longer the shutdown's going to last?""And then there's the issue of confidence, from both consumers and the market. ""What would be worrisome is if businesses start to lose confidence"" in the government, Kathy Bostjancic, head U.S. financial market economist at Oxford Economics, told The Wall Street Journal. ""They'll pull back on hiring and investment, and it'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where negativity in the stock market turns to negativity in the [broader] economy.""The shutdown is also affecting the release of economic data. The monthly jobs report will still come out, but the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau have both ceased reporting, CNN Business reports. Ditto with reports on crop production and pricing from the Department of Agriculture.Experts say that the economy has rebounded after previous shutdowns. But many forecasts already predict economic growth in 2019 to be slow – and a long shutdown could compound that."

But the rangers who ordinarily patrol the park have been sent packing by the spending standoff in Washington that has forced the shutdown of about a quarter of the federal government.""The visitors centers are closed,"" said John Lauretig, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of Joshua Tree National Park. ""All the bathrooms are still open, but they're not being maintained right now by the Park Service. So the local community has rallied together and started cleaning the bathrooms and restocking the toilet paper.""As the partial government shutdown enters its second weekend with no sign of compromise on the horizon, Lauretig and others are digging in for what could be a long-term project. ""As the dumpsters fill up and the pit toilets fill up, what kinds of solutions can we make to solve those problems?"" he asked.Policymakers in Washington have offered little hope of a quick compromise.""I can't tell you when the government's going to be open,"" President Trump told reporters this week. He's insisting that Congress provide $5 billion for his proposed border wall. Democrats, who are set to take control of the House next week, have refused. The stalemate has left nine major government departments — including Homeland Security, Interior and State — without spending authorization.So far, the effects of the partial shutdown have been little more than an inconvenience to some and invisible to many. Some 400,000 critical federal employees have stayed on the job. And while they're not being paid at the moment, that impact won't really show up until their next paychecks, which are due Jan. 11. Still, the longer the shutdown drags on, the more widely the effects will be felt.""More things will be shutting down,"" said Jacqueline Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers. ""There were a few agencies that are affected by the funding lapse that had a little bit of money left over to take them to the end of the year. But that money will be running out.""The EPA, for example, had announced plans to halt operations at midnight Friday. The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will shutter their doors Jan. 2.The food stamps program (officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) and the school lunch program are funded through January but could take a hit if the shutdown continues beyond that.White House economist Kevin Hassett predicted the shutdown would not do lasting damage to the U.S. economy. But he admitted it could cause a blip in the unemployment rate if hundreds of thousands of federal workers are still idle in a couple of weeks.""That would be more of a temporary thing,"" Hassett said. ""It's not something that we expect is really material for the outlook.""Social Security and Medicare payments are still being made, as usual.But applications for Federal Housing Administration-backed mortgages could be delayed. FEMA also rattled the housing market when it said it would stop selling flood insurance during the shutdown — a move that could have jeopardized some 40,000 home sales in flood-prone areas each month.""If they can't get the flood insurance, they can't get the mortgage,"" said Allan Dechert, who heads the insurance committee for the National Association of Realtors.Under pressure, FEMA backtracked late Friday and said it would resume selling flood insurance during the shutdown.But at Joshua Tree National Park for now, volunteers will keep scrubbing toilets. But devotees say that's no substitute for the park rangers who ordinarily keep an eye on the Native American rock art and other history dotting the desert landscape.""There are rare and unique artifacts up there that need to be protected by a fully-staffed National Park Service staff,"" Lauretig said. ""My concern is right now those one-of-a-kind kind of things in the park are unprotected, unfortunately."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/28/680720032/national-parks-many-are-open-during-the-shutdown-their-bathrooms-not-so-much","Many of the United States' national parks remain open to visitors during the partial government shutdown. But if you go, be prepared – you're probably on your own in there.A notice on the website of Big Bend National Park in West Texas is representative:The park adds: ""Emergency services remain available, but response times may be delayed."" So while visitors can in many cases avoid paying admission fees, this is no time to go breaking a leg. Some lodges and shops operated by commercial entities remain open in some parks.Elsewhere, some state governments and tourism boards have been using their own funds to keep the parks open during the busy vacation week between Christmas and New Year's Day. But as the shutdown heads into a second week with no clear end in sight, many of those funds may be about to dry up.In Utah, the state has provided funding to keep open the visitors centers at Bryce Canyon, Zion and Arches national parks through Dec. 31. After that, the parks will be open, but the visitors centers closed.""We don't like having to do it, and the federal government should be doing it,"" Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah told The New York Times. ""We're frustrated — we're probably beyond frustrated, maybe even angry — but we're prepared.""Arizona's state government donated a bit more than $64,000 to keep some services at the Grand Canyon operating for the first seven days of the shutdown. That money has been funding trash collection, bathroom cleaning, and snow removal on trails and sidewalks.New York State is paying the federal government $65,000 a day to keep open the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island, which receive an average of 12,000 visitors a day.""Glad so many people are visiting these two symbols of hope and freedom. New York State will keep these parks open until the #TrumpShutdown ends,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Thursday.In Philadelphia, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, thanks to $32,000 in funding from Visit Philadelphia, The Inquirer reported.Many attractions in Washington, D.C., have remained open since the shutdown, getting by on leftover funds. But that money is nearly gone, and on Jan. 2, the museums that are part of the Smithsonian Institution will close, as will the National Zoo.But elsewhere, the shutdown has spelled something of a free-for-all.The Los Angeles Times reports that at Joshua Tree National Park, which is open but unstaffed, local do-gooders have been emptying trash cans, scrubbing toilets, and restocking toilet paper – all of their own volition.The Times reports that one of those volunteers, Rand Abbott, is a 54-year-old rock climber, Marine Corps veteran, and paraplegic. Abbott said he has been handing out trash bags to people and resupplying toilet paper to park bathrooms – but it's tough going: ""Seventy percent of the people I'm running into are extremely rude,"" he told the newspaper. ""Yesterday, I had my life threatened two times. It's crazy in there right now.""It's a good idea to check a park's website before you go. But the National Park Service warns that park websites and social media accounts may not be up to date — due, of course, to the shutdown."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/28/680616453/struggling-government-workers-are-caught-up-in-the-shutdown","A government job probably pays better and is more secure than one in the private sector, but for many federal workers, it hardly assures a good income.The 800,000 federal workers who aren't being paid because of the partial government shutdown include many who struggle to make ends meet even during ordinary times.""I only have about $1,000 in savings,"" says Brooke Cole, who is furloughed from her job at a Coast Guard Air Station in Port Angeles, Wash. ""I have to pay my rent; I have a car payment, child care payments, student loan payments, utility payments, all sorts of fun stuff.""Federal government employees are paid according to their position on the General Schedule, the official pay classification system overseen by the Office of Personnel Management. Workers at the GS-1 level start out earning about $19,000 a year, which for a family of three would be about poverty level.An employee at the other end of the federal pay scale (GS-15) can make as much as about $140,000, but, as of 2014, that classification included only about 4 percent of the federal workforce. About 1 in 8 U.S. government workers are at the GS-6 level or below, meaning they earn little more than $40,000 a year and probably less, even if their work is professional.Among those workers is Paul Kiefer who examines tax returns for the IRS at its service center in Austin, Texas.""I'm looking at everybody's return to make sure everything is correct,"" he says, ""and if there's an error, I may have to correct that error."" Even with that responsibility, however, Kiefer is paid at the GS-6 level, and his income is not sufficient to allow him to go long without a paycheck. He is currently on furlough.""Right now, I'm worried about whether or not I can make my credit card payment, whether I can pay for the electricity, get any food, pay the rent, whether or not I'm going to be thrown out onto the street. It's that serious,"" he says.Kiefer was also affected by the 2013 government shutdown. In that case, he eventually got back pay, but only because Congress authorized it.Trump administration officials predict Congress will once again enact legislation to restore lost pay.Possibility of eventual pay""They might miss a pay period because the government is shut down, but in the end, even if they aren't working, Congress has decided to pay people for the whole time,"" White House economist Kevin Hassett told reporters on Wednesday. ""So, in the end, it's really just a short-term problem, not a long-term problem.""Such reassurances do not apply, however, to government workers who are employed through a private contractor. The number of outsourced federal jobs has increased substantially in recent years, and contract employees who are not working during the government shutdown are unlikely to be paid for the time they are furloughed.Almost 2 million workers employed by the federal government under contract earn less than $12 per hour, according to a 2013 study by Demos, a left-of-center research organization.The partial government shutdown is even affecting active-duty members of the U.S. Coast Guard. While it is part of the U.S. military, the Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department.Administration officials are downplaying the financial effects of the shutdown on workers, but they acknowledge it will have some impact.The Office of Personnel Management has posted sample letters on its website that furloughed employees can use to ask their creditors for extra time to pay their bills.The office suggests workers conclude their appeals for leniency with the line, ""I appreciate your willingness to work with me and your understanding during this difficult time."""

The National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of the American Indian Heye Center in New York City will also close.As of October, there were 20.9 million visits to the Smithsonian in 2018 – an average of more than 2 million a month.""The most important thing was to be able to get through this week because we didn't want to disappoint people,"" Thomas said, adding that traffic typically begins to slow in January and February when overall tourism in Washington, D.C., also lags.""But, even then,"" she said, ""you still have people who come for a once in a lifetime visit or to see something very special and it's a shame to turn them away.""According to Thomas, among those who will continue working through the shutdown are security personnel, some maintenance workers, experts who care for special works of art or exhibits and veterinarians, who, among other duties, watch over Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Bei Bei as they put on their ""Roly-poly Panda Parade.""(If you have not yet seen this compilation of the three pandas having a grand old time rolling around in the snow, stop reading and do it now.)The last time the Smithsonian was forced to keep its doors closed was in 2013.

""I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing.""""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""The partial shutdown, which began Saturday, was triggered by a lapse in funding for a quarter of the government's departments and agencies. It affects some 800,000 government workers. Workers deemed nonessential will be furloughed, while ""essential"" workers will be required to report to their jobs, but with no guarantee of a paycheck.The president, who canceled plans to retreat to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, for the holidays, instead remained at the White House, where he issued a series of angry tweets over the shutdown. He has blamed Democrats for the impasse, which came to a head over the weekend after lawmakers refused to agree to $5 billion in funding to begin building a border wall or fence, something the president has long championed. Democrats say a physical barrier would be expensive and ineffective.When he was campaigning for president in 2016, Trump told supporters that the wall would be built and that Mexico would pay for it.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York suggested that the president's insistence on a wall is little more than an attempt to mollify his political base.""Instead of bringing certainty into people's lives, he's continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,"" Schumer said in a joint statement issued on Christmas Day along with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.""The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it,"" the Democratic leaders added.Sentiment on Capitol Hill is that the closure could continue through the middle of January as tentative efforts at a compromise have been unsuccessful.As Politico reports, ""While Trump has told allies he'd be willing to come down from his demand for $5 billion in border wall money, Democrats have stood firm on $1.3 billion for fencing, consistent with current spending levels. On Saturday, [Vice President Mike] Pence offered Schumer a bill to reopen the government that would provide $2.1 billion for fencing and an additional $400 million for Trump's other immigration priorities; Democrats countered with $1.3 billion in fencing and more aid for Puerto Rico as part of a disaster package, according to a person familiar with the talks, which essentially recirculated past offers."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/24/679838115/violence-against-women-act-expires-because-of-government-shutdown","The partial shutdown of the U.S. government, which is affecting more than 800,000 federal workers and numerous government agencies, also has consequences for the Violence Against Women Act, which expired at midnight on Friday. Separately, both the House and the Senate passed spending deals that included clauses that would have extended VAWA until Feb. 8. But because the law's future became inextricably tied to the larger budget debate, which hinges on a dispute between Democrats and Republicans over funding for a border wall, it was not reauthorized.VAWA funds and administers numerous programs assisting survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Its expiration does not prevent all of these programs from being administered — according to The Washington Post, grants already awarded under the law will not be affected. But future payment requests from programs that receive VAWA funding will be delayed until the law is reauthorized. According to Roll Call, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services administer most VAWA programming. Some VAWA programs that HHS administers may continue to receive funding even though VAWA expirations have expired; Congress approved fiscal 2019 funding for HHS in September. But funding for the Department of Justice is tied to the current budget debate. In a letter she sent to House Speaker Paul Ryan in September, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Republicans for only pursuing short-term reauthorization of VAWA. When the act was set to expire earlier this year on Sept. 30, it was extended until Dec. 7. And before it expired on Dec. 7, it was once again extended by a short-term bill. That extension ran out on Dec. 21 as the government went into its partial shutdown.In her letter, Pelosi references a bill introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, in July. The bill extends and expands VAWA, introducing additional measures that prohibit the sale of firearms to people subject to protection orders and to persons convicted of stalking. Roll Call reported earlier this month that the gun-related clauses were the likely reason no Republicans supported Jackson Lee's bill. It was never brought to the House floor. In September, 46 House Republicans signed a letter addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, urging them to reauthorize VAWA. ""This is not a partisan issue,"" the letter says. ""VAWA has been continually reauthorized on a bipartisan basis in Congress. We must act now to maintain and strengthen this critical law."" The letter did not encourage the adoption of a specific bill. The last time VAWA was reauthorized was in 2013, and it took a bit of a political battle. As NPR's Eyder Peralta reported, some Republicans took issue with provisions that offered new protections for Native women and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The Violence Against Women Act was first passed in 1994 by a Congress with an unprecedented number of women. Most of the women who served in that Congress were elected in 1992, the year after Anita Hill testified before Congress during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' confirmation hearings. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/24/679820514/as-partial-shutdown-continues-fda-prepares-to-furlough-employees","The partial government shutdown that started Saturday will affect quite a few  activities of the Food and Drug Administration. Although most of the agency's employees weren't working over the weekend and on Monday and Tuesday because of federal holidays, FDA will furlough some 40 percent of its staff starting Wednesday.  However, much of the agency's workforce will continue through the shutdown, with more than 10,000 FDA employees — nearly 60 percent — reporting to work, according to numbers released by the agency Friday. The majority of those people are doing work funded by user fees paid by pharmaceutical and medical device companies, according to an analysis by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA, an advocacy group representing patient and consumer advocates as well as trade associations.  Here is a quick breakdown of how the shutdown will affect the agency's work.  Activities that will continue during the shutdown The FDA will continue work that's critical to public health and safety. It will be able to respond to emergencies, like the flu and foodborne illnesses. It will continue recalls of any foods, drugs and medical devices that pose a high risk to human health. As FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted over the weekend, the agency will also continue to screen ""food and drug imports"" and inspect any facilities that might pose ""an imminent threat to health and life."" Some criminal and civil investigations where there is an immediate risk to public health will also continue through the shutdown, as will all of the agency's work that is funded by user fees. For example, the agency will continue to oversee the manufacturing and distribution of all tobacco products. ""The tobacco program is 100 percent user-fee funded,"" says Steven Grossman, deputy executive director at the Alliance for a Stronger FDA.  Similarly, much of the agency's work with new products is funded by fees paid by industry, so the FDA will continue reviewing and approving drugs and medical devices where the fees have already been paid. It will also continue to review requests for clinical research and issue any necessary guidance.  Activities that will stop during the shutdown Broadly speaking, all activities that are less likely to have an immediate impact on health and safety of consumers will come to a halt. For example, routine regulatory and compliance work for medical products, animal drugs and most foods will be paused, according to a contingency staffing plan put forward by the Department of Health and Human Services. Routine inspections of facilities and all work related to cosmetics and nutrition will also be paused during this period. And the shutdown may affect some aspects of the drug review process as an estimated 30 percent of that work is funded by appropriations, according to the analysis by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA.  Should consumers be concerned about food and drug safety during the shutdown? Probably not, at least not for now, says Grossman. ""In the short term, consumers should not see much of an impact,"" he says. That's because ""anything that could affect human health and safety [in the near term] will be staffed."" "

About 800,000 federal workers will feel the effects as lawmakers try to come to an agreement on a set of spending bills to keep the government funded.A central sticking point remains funding for President Trump's proposed border wall, and with the Senate adjourned until Thursday, there is no apparent quick end in sight.As both sides work to solve the impasse, here is a rundown of what will and won't be affected by the shutdown.Air traffic control, the TSA and Amtrak Air traffic control and officers with the Transportation Security Administration will keep working in order to keep air travel running. Amtrak trains will also continue to operate as usual.Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid People will continue to receive their Social Security checks, and Medicare and Medicaid will not be interrupted. However, new applicants to these programs might experience a delay before approval.The military U.S. military operations will continue around the world.

The appropriation bills before Congress do not touch the (special counsel's office),"" a spokesman for the special counsel's office told CNN.U.S. Postal Service Post offices will remain open, and deliveries will continue during the shutdown.Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo The Smithsonian Institution tweeted that it will continue operation of its museums, research centers and the National Zoo through Jan. 1.NORAD Santa tracker The military says its famous Santa tracker won't be slowed down by the shutdown because it is run by volunteers and funded by the Department of Defense's budget that was approved earlier this year, according to The Associated Press.What will be affected by the government shutdown: National parks Some national parks will remain open but may reduce staffing. Facilities such as restrooms may be closed.  ""At Yellowstone, Yosemite and many other major parks, the park service announced it would keep the access to parklands open, but many services, including restrooms, trash removal, some visitors centers and snow removal, would cease,"" The Guardian reports.Other parks and monuments, such as the Fort McHenry National Monument in Maryland and the Fort Pulaski National Monument in Georgia, will be closed.Small-business ownersSmall Business Administration guarantees to back loans will freeze for some business owners.""Due to the lapse of government funding, SBA will remain inactive until further notice.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/23/679646329/santa-tracker-unaffected-by-government-shutdown-norad-says","Amid the partial government shutdown, at least one critical service remains operational: NORAD's Santa tracker.More than 1,500 military personnel and volunteers at an Air Force base in Colorado will be hard at work Christmas Eve, tracking Santa Claus and answering children's calls.Every year, in a tradition that dates back to the Cold War, volunteers field tens of thousands of calls and emails from around the world, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Children ask for Santa's location, discuss their Christmas lists and probe volunteers for other details.There's even a handbook for handling different kinds of requests, Politico reports.Those volunteers, who take two-hour shifts starting in the early morning on Dec. 24, wouldn't be there if not for a typo in a local newspaper in 1955. When Col. Harry Shoup picked up his secret hotline at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, he was expecting a call from a four-star general at the Pentagon, according to a 2014 StoryCorps interview with his children.""And then there was a small voice that just asked, 'Is this Santa Claus?' "" his daughter, Pam Farrell says.His family says that Shoup was annoyed. The United States was nearly a decade into the Cold War, and the colonel was prepared for reports of a nuclear attack, not requests for Santa Claus.But when the child started to cry, he responded jovially. Then he asked for the boy's mother. The mother explained that a Sears ad in the newspaper instructed kids to call Santa ""any time day or night."" But the newspaper had accidentally printed the number for Shoup's private red phone, instead of the store's.So as the calls came in, Shoup put his airmen on the phones to pretend to be Santa Claus. The tradition has continued for more than six decades, outliving its creator — Shoup died in 2009 — and maybe even its accidental architect. Sears filed for bankruptcy in October.And the ""tracking"" technology has evolved over time. Maj. Todd Walter, a mission crew commander with the Canadian Air Defence, offers some specs in a video.""We use radar systems scattered across the world, along with satellites providing infrared imagery, and then we have Santa Cams scattered throughout the world,"" Walter says. ""And then jet fighters that also go out and intercept Santa.""NORAD has received criticism in previous years for tying military products to Santa's journey in kids' imaginations. In 2013, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood spoke out against a promotional video showing those animated fighter jets, saying the video inserted ""violence and militarism"" into a beloved tradition.The quirky holiday tradition also doubles as a marketing tool. Corporate licensees foot the bill, as NPR's Mark Memmott reported in 2014. This year, HP advertised its support for the program, and The Hill reports Microsoft and General Motors have gotten involved with the effort.None of that dampens the cheer of children who pick up the phone.""They're all really sweet, small voices,"" Madison Hill, a volunteer who helped answer the phones, told The Associated Press. ""I had a little girl tell me good night instead of goodbye. It's really sweet.""The bad news? Unlike when Shoup picked up his phone in 1955, these days you can't talk directly to Santa.""Santa and his reindeer must go, go, go,"" booms an animated Santa in a series of NORAD FAQ videos. ""We can't stop to chat, although it would be fun.""He does answer a few questions on the website, though, like, ""What's Santa's favorite cookie?"" and ""Do kids need to eat their dinner?"" Asked by a kid whether he could have a real firetruck, not a toy one, Santa deflects. ""I'm sure one day you'll grow big and strong and maybe become a firefighter to help others.""To get the latest information on Santa's movements this Christmas Eve, call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) or email noradtrackssanta@outlook.com.

Trump has demanded any funding bill include money for his border wall — his central campaign promise — and appears to be goading congressional Democrats into a fight after being egged on by his base and conservative commentators. While a version of the legislation that includes some $5.7 billion for a wall on the Southwest border passed in the House Thursday night, the Senate won't take up a spending measure until there is a deal that can pass all of Congress and that Trump has committed to supporting. Vice President Pence, along with budget director and incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, continues to negotiate with bipartisan congressional leaders on Capitol Hill Friday night. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's office told lawmakers they would get a 24-hour notice before the next vote making it likely a partial shutdown would continue through at least part of the weekend. In addition, Monday and Tuesday of next week are already scheduled as federal holidays. Robert Wilkie, secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, issued a statement Friday night saying that ""all VA operations will continue unimpeded"" in the event of a partial shutdown because the VA ""is fully funded for fiscal year 2019."" ""We thank the president and Congress for their commitment to our nation's heroes in funding VA, and stand ready to provide all of the VA benefits and services our Veterans have earned,"" Wilkie also said. Trump said earlier Friday the government could be shut down ""for a very long time"" unless the Senate approves a funding bill opposed by Democrats. In a series of morning tweets, Trump, who previously said he would ""be proud"" to shut down the government, attempted to shift the blame onto Democrats for a potential shutdown.""If Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time.  People don't want Open Borders and Crime!"" Trump tweeted.A procedural vote on the House bill narrowly passed in the Senate Friday evening — after being held open for more than five hours to allow senators returning to Washington to vote — with Pence presiding over the chamber to break a 47-47 tie. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said there wouldn't be any more votes until an agreement between the White House and both Democratic and Republican congressional leaders is reached to keep the government open. Wavering Republicans who had been considering opposing the procedural vote — such as Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who had changed his ""no"" vote to a ""yes"" — underscored that their support was given in a good-faith effort to keep negotiations going ahead of the midnight deadline. ""What this does I think is to push this ahead to a negotiation that yields a result and does the best we can to keep from shutting down government or if it does shut down, shutting down briefly,"" Corker said on the Senate floor Friday evening.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had told reporters Thursday night: ""The bottom line is simple. The Trump temper tantrum will shut down the government, but it will not get him his wall.""Schumer did meet Friday afternoon with Pence, Mulvaney and Kushner at their request. Schumer's office said he ""reminded them that any proposal with funding for the wall will not pass the Senate"" but that other proposals that ""contain border security funding — without the wall ... could pass both chambers.""  Pence, Mulvaney and Kushner also met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and some other House GOP lawmakers after their session with Schumer.Unless funding is approved by Congress and signed by the president, the nine federal departments and several independent agencies that were not part of an earlier spending deal will shut down 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks as Christmas approaches.Many employees who do what are considered essential duties, including law enforcement agents and Transportation Security Administration officers, would remain on the job.  Trump also met with Senate Republicans earlier on Friday.Trump has urged McConnell to change Senate rules and allow a simple majority to pass the spending bill, rather than 60 votes, a major disruption to Senate protocol known as the ""nuclear option.""When they held the majority, Democrats changed the rules to allow a majority to vote for nominations, but not legislation, and McConnell has opposed going further, with the knowledge that if Democrats regain the majority, it could be used against Republicans.After the president's tweet, a number of GOP senators said they would not be in favor of changing the rules. ""We have rules to follow,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. ""I want to put a stop to this practice of the Senate breaking its rules to change its rules. I will not vote to turn the Senate into a rule-breaking institution and I hope that my colleagues will not.""And a spokesman for McConnell put the final nail in the coffin with a statement that said, ""The Leader has said for years that the votes are not there in the Conference to use the nuclear option. Just this morning, several Senators put out statements confirming their opposition, and confirming that there is not a majority in the conference to go down that road.""NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence contributed to this report."

The House is expected to take up the bill on Thursday. Funding currently expires at midnight on Friday.After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., introduced the measure, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Senate Democrats would support it. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also issued a statement of support. Still, it's unclear whether President Trump will sign the bill.  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway wouldn't commit to NPR's Tamara Keith that Trump would sign the bill. ""The president is looking at the CR and I will allow him to make the announcements on whether he's signing it or when he signs it, but don't ever bet against Donald Trump and don't ever think that he is backing down or becoming wishy-washy on a central promise to have border security and to build that wall,"" Conway said. Conway also complained that the GOP-led Congress was taking ""the path of least resistance."" ""Why are you just going for the short-term funding for the CR and not tackling the bigger issues, the immigration reform, border security?"" she asked.If it becomes law, the spending measure will postpone the day of reckoning over the final bits of the federal budget until the new Congress is sworn in and Democrats take control of the House.In a tweet, McConnell said the funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, would last through Feb. 8, 2019.Last week, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government if he did not get an additional $5 billion for a border wall. But Democrats in the House and Senate balked at that, and with Democrats taking the House majority as of January, it appears Trump's plans for a wall are, if not dead, on life support.Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, argued that Republicans were giving Democrats a ""gift"" by delaying rather than fighting to fund the border wall now while they still control all of Congress. The continuing resolution means spending for the nine government agencies that have yet to receive their budgets would remain at current levels.While congressional leaders decried the inability to reach agreement on a longer-term spending measure, as Christmas approaches lawmakers are eager to wrap up their work and go home.

And some iconic sites, including the Statue of Liberty, may be closed altogether if the park service follows past practices.That is, of course, unless Congress and the White House resolve their latest spat over funding the federal government.For the National Park Service and many other agencies, funding runs out on Dec. 21 at midnight. And while the 75 percent of the government whose budget bills are already approved will be unaffected, the remaining 25 percent include some high-profile agencies and departments. Among them:Independent agencies, including NASA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, will also be closed. The FDA ""does routine, unannounced inspections,"" Food Safety News wrote in January. ""During these partial government shutdowns, FDA likely ceases routine checks while using its 'essential' personnel on problems that arise.""But within those agencies, some 420,000 employees are ""excepted,"" in government parlance, from furloughs; that is, they are considered essential and will be on the job, but they won't be getting paychecks.They include law enforcement officers at the:TSA officers will still be screening airline passengers in one of the busiest travel periods of the year, but will very likely have to wait for paychecks during the holiday season.An additional 380,000 employees will be furloughed — that is, sent home — also without pay, although Congress has previously appropriated back pay for federal workers when the prior shutdowns have ended.Is this any way to run a government? Well, President Trump last week said he would ""be proud to shut down the government"" over his demands for money for a border wall, although he has since tried to back away from that position.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of not understanding that ""people need their paychecks. Maybe that's not the life he leads,"" Pelosi told reporters Thursday. ""It's not enough to say we'll pay you in January when people have to make ends meet in December.""Pelosi told reporters Tuesday bipartisan congressional leaders may be working on their own Plan B. One option they tossed around to avoid a shutdown was for Congress to pass a stopgap bill to keep federal agencies funded through early January. But they haven't reached an agreement even on that limited measure yet.The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, called on the two sides to resolve their dispute.""Our members take home an average of around $500 each week,"" AFGE President J. David Cox said in a statement. ""Any interruption in their pay will have a devastating impact on them, their families and their communities.""Cox added, ""Our members are asking how they are supposed to pay for rent, food and gas if they are required to work without a paycheck. The holiday season makes these inquiries especially heart-wrenching.""If it happens, this would be the second partial government shutdown this year. Agencies closed over a weekend last January in a brief spending squabble.So it comes as no surprise perhaps that a new survey of government employees by the Partnership for Public Service finds a decline in how federal workers view their jobs and workplaces, what the study calls ""employee engagement,"" from last year.Scores declined at almost 60 percent for agencies, while 40 percent improved. Over the past three years, scores improved at some 70 percent of agencies.The president himself will be out of town during the shutdown, on a 16-day stay at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Not the greatest of optics, if those plans hold.NPR congressional editor Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report."

They want to ""reach out to all Americans"" with uplifting appeals to unity and bipartisanship. But they can't resist pumping up the pep rally for their party and most loyal supporters.If that applies to all presidents in all seasons, it surely applied Tuesday night to President Trump, who has found the halfway point of his term to be fraught with political travail.The president's address had been delayed a week because of a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government, a shutdown for which polls showed he bore the burden of blame. His approval ratings in general had slumped in the new year, and a phalanx of investigations is moving inexorably forward in Congress as well as in the justice system. While he projected his usual triumphant bravado Tuesday night, Trump was also confronting for the first time a chamber of Congress controlled by the opposition. The newly enlarged ranks of House Democrats were quite visibly arrayed before him. Especially hard to miss were the scores of women among them wearing white to celebrate the centenary of Congress passing the constitutional amendment that empowered women to vote.The president confronted this new challenge with a version of the familiar State of the Union strategy. He began with an appeal for unity, an appeal much foreshadowed by pre-speech White House briefings. He also praised America (""We do the incredible, we defy the impossible ... Together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history""), recalled its heroics in space travel and World War II, pledged to eradicate HIV in a decade and announced new spending against childhood cancer. The speech was so full of applause lines, emotional introductions of guests and exhortations of patriotism that it lasted nearly an hour and a half. It was even longer than last year's address, landing third on the all-time list for length (behind two of Bill Clinton's entries). At several points, the clapping and cheering segued into chants of ""USA! USA!"" from the Republican side of the chamber.(At another point, when the president acknowledged the record number of women elected to Congress in November, the Democratic side erupted in chants of ""USA! USA!"")Understandably enough, the president praised the soaring heights of the economic recovery, which has been peaking since he took office.  He made a special point of citing the record low unemployment numbers for black and Hispanic workers. In a similar vein, he celebrated passage of the First Step Act, a bipartisan effort at reforming the criminal justice system. He introduced the well-publicized Alice Johnson, who got out of jail last year under the new law after having her case brought to Trump's attention by Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. The president also renewed his call for a paid version of the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, a favorite issue for his daughter Ivanka (as criminal justice reform was for her husband, Jared Kushner). The Step Act got far more attention than the Republican tax reform that took effect last year and rated just two sentences Tuesday night.The last Congress also managed to pass bills attacking the opioid crisis, reordering the Department of Veterans Affairs and reauthorizing the nation's farm programs. If we could do those things together, Trump implied, anything was possible.There could be a deal to restrain prescription drug prices, he said, or to restore the nation's aging infrastructure.""Victory is not winning for our party,"" he said, ""victory is winning for our country."" But, like other presidents before him, Trump alternated his  open-handed gesture with occasional hard jabs at the opposition.The move away from peace and harmony came abruptly after the traditional declaration that ""the state of our union is strong."" Trump pivoted to saying the ""only thing"" that could stop ""the economic miracle"" would be ""foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations.""To be sure, the new lineup of Democratic committee chairs has already begun probing a range of activities related to Trump and his administration. But the larger shadow over his White House is cast by the investigation led by former FBI chief Robert Mueller, who was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Both are lifelong Republicans.From that point on, the speech's primary emphasis was on the agenda the president himself wants to pursue — with or without the cooperation of the opposition. And no part of that agenda seemed to matter nearly so much as his vision for a wall with Mexico.Much of the speech was devoted to depicting the Southern border as a threat to national security — a gateway for crime, drugs and illegal immigration. The talk of ""massive caravans"" sweeping northward was back from the days of the shutdown. Horrific crimes allegedly committed by members of MS-13 were detailed. Trump introduced a woman in the gallery whose parents were killed, he said, by an illegal immigrant.As there has been little sign of movement on either side of the wall debate, it now seems likely the Feb. 15 deadline for a deal will not be met. Many expect that will trigger a presidential declaration of a national security emergency, which Trump says would enable him to build the wall with funds appropriated for other purposes.But the wall was not the only gauntlet Trump tossed to the members of Congress. He also called for a new law limiting abortions late in a pregnancy, excoriating the New York Legislature for having ""cheered with delight the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from their mother's womb moments before birth."" Trump also took a shot at embattled Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for remarks he made in a radio interview about abortion late in a pregnancy. Northam is a physician. The lurid descriptions recalled some of the language Trump had used in debating Hillary Clinton in the fall of 2016. And the president benefited from the connection that helped him back with white evangelical voters that November. No other social or cultural identifier is more likely to mark a Trump supporter in 2019. Trump reached out to these backers twice in discussing his foreign policy, talking about moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, the ""true capital"" of Israel. Later, he spoke of his pressure on Iran in terms of its importance as a threat to Israel. While support for Israel is a plus for many American Jews, it is also highly important to many evangelical Christians. One other aspect of foreign policy did arise near the end of the speech. The president noted the power struggle in Venezuela and denounced the government of President Nicolás Maduro, ""whose socialist policies have turned the richest country in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."" Trump followed this with a vow: ""We are born free and we will stay free. Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country."" That provided a moment for TV cameras to seek out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom call themselves democratic socialists. It also provided several applause lines that brought the Republican section to its feet, cheering and once again chanting ""USA! USA!""Begun in sunny weather and smiles, the speech descended into a dark and stormy midsection. But the finish was full of rosy rays of sunset glory. The closing phrases were somewhere between the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" and the ""Lord's Prayer.""""And we must always keep faith with America's destiny, that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all nations of the world!"" Shortly after the speech, the TV networks carried brief remarks by Stacey Abrams, who was giving the official response of the Democratic Party. Abrams, 45, lost a close race for governor in Georgia in November. She was the first African-American woman to give a party's official response to the SOTU, as well as the first person to do so who was not a federal official or statewide officeholder. She said the shutdown had been ""a stunt engineered by the president of the United States,"" but spent most of her time describing her own story and focusing on voting rights.Abrams shared responding duties with this year's Spanish-language responder, Xavier Becerra. A former congressman, Becerra is now the attorney general of California and plans to sue if Trump declares a national security emergency in pursuit of his wall."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/691822669/california-attorney-general-vows-to-sue-if-trump-uses-emergency-powers-to-build","California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says he plans to sue the Trump administration the moment the president declares a national emergency to free up funds for a border wall.Becerra was responding in Spanish to President Trump's State of the Union address to Congress. But he released his response before Trump even delivered the first words of his remarks, anticipating a speech in which the president doubled down on his demand for the construction of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.""The idea of declaring a state of emergency on the border that does not exist, to justify robbing funds that belong to the victims of fires, floods and hurricanes, to pay for the wall is not only immoral, it is illegal,"" Becerra said in Spanish, alluding to reports that Trump may tap into disaster relief funds to construct the wall.The president did not mention using emergency powers to build the wall in his speech, but has suggested to reporters that he might consider using those powers if Congress doesn't agree to authorize its funding in a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Declaring a national emergency would allow the president to divert funding set aside for other purposes for the wall.In his speech, Trump painted an urgent crisis at the border, speaking of ""large, organized caravans"" at the southern border, but most of the migrants waiting at the border have obtained a humanitarian visa from the Mexican government, according to NPR's John Burnett and Carrie Kahn. Eddie Trevino, a Cameron County Judge in Brownsville, recently told reporters: ""There is no Central American invasion. This is a manufactured crisis.""""We are ready to reject this senseless proposal in court the moment it touches the ground,"" Becerra said.In his address, Trump reiterated his plan for a border wall as a moral and security issue and stressed that Congress has until Feb. 15 to pass a bill to ""fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our Southern Border.""""I will get it built,"" Trump told Congress. ""Walls work and walls save lives.""Don't see the graphic above? Click here.President Trump's insistence on a border wall ultimately led to a stand-off between Congress and the president in December and January, resulting in the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history.If Trump declared a national emergency, the act could be voted down in Congress, according to NPR's Scott Horsley. Trump would face strong pushback immediately by the Democratic-controlled House, but he is also facing opposition from some members of his own party in the Republican-controlled Senate, which could mean a resolution of disapproval could pass both chambers.Legal action in the federal courts is also another likely route to challenge any emergency declaration, and Becerra is a familiar opponent. Since taking the post of California's top lawyer in January 2017, Becerra has sued the Trump administration 45 times on behalf of California, more than any other state Attorney General.""In the courts or in Congress or in the voting booths, we have to fight for our agenda,"" Becerra said. ""And we're winning.""'Becerra has sued the administration over several immigration-related actions, including the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which could make non-citizens less likely to participate in the count, given the increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.California and other states also sued the administration over its plan to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects certain immigrants from being deported. In early January, a federal judge blocked that decision and said the program could continue as lawsuits move forward in court.Becerra, 61, has said that Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric reminds him of the discrimination his own parents faced. His father was born in Sacramento but grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.In his speech, President Trump highlighted crimes committed by people in the country illegally, despite research showing immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than people born in the U.S. and that illegal immigration does not increase the prevalence of violent crime.Don't see the graphic above? Click here.""My parents had to put up with some of these indignities, these injustices. My dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of the signs that said 'No dogs or Mexicans allowed' even though he was a U.S. citizen,"" Becerra told NPR member station KQED. ""When you hear someone like Donald Trump say those vile things you absorb, you remember, but then you try to move forward as best you can.""At the end of his response to Trump, Becerra called to mind his parents, who just celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary.""If you asked them, my parents, what is the state of our union, I'm sure they would paint a more realistic image than that which President Trump presented to us tonight. They know what it means to work hard and respect the rules,"" Becerra said.Before Becerra took the job as California's first Latino attorney general, he served for more than 24 years in the House, most recently for California's 34th district, which includes part of Los Angeles County.Becerra was chosen to give the State of the Union's Spanish response, a speech given most years since 2011, by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif..""Attorney General Becerra is a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter,"" Speaker Pelosi said in a statement. She continued that Becerra would deliver a ""strong message of progress for all American families and communities.""Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and State House Minority Leader delivered the English language response to the State of the Union. Abrams did not touch much on immigration issues, leaving that to be done in Spanish, the language spoken by many of the immigrants who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.Editor's note on March 1: The following transcript has been edited to fix grammatical mistakes and to address slight differences between Attorney General Becerra's prepared remarks and what he said during his address.Nota del redactor, 1 de marzo: La siguiente transcripción fue redactada para corregir errores gramaticales y para abordar diferencias entre los comentarios preparados del fiscal general Becerra y lo que él dijo en su discursco.Buenas noches.Es un honor estar con ustedes desde la escuela secundaria C.K. McClatchy High School en la ciudad de Sacramento, la capital del estado de California. Me encuentro aquí con futuros líderes de nuestro país — estudiantes de la McClatchy — donde yo también estudié, ¡pero hace como cuatro décadas!Yo soy hijo de inmigrantes trabajadores y el primero en mi familia que pudo caminar por las puertas de la universidad, y por las puertas de la oportunidad.Mis padres empezaron su vida aquí por la misma razón que viene mucha gente a este país: para trabajar duro y darles a sus hijos una vida mejor. Al salir de Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, trajeron con ellos su fe y no mucho más. Confiaban en la promesa de este país de que todos aquellos que se esfuerzan y cumplen con las reglas, se han ganado la oportunidad de salir adelante.Sé que soy producto de los que lucharon por abrir esas puertas de oportunidad. El optimismo – que caracteriza las olas de inmigrantes que han llegado aquí – corre en mi sangre. Y si el estado de nuestra nación se puede caracterizar como ""fuerte"", es porque gente como mis padres y los suyos — ciudadanos o migrantes — construyeron este país.Durante 24 años de servicio como congresista en Washington, yo conocí mucho de nuestro gran país y trabajé con tres presidentes diferentes. Y ahora, como fiscal general, defendiendo y abogando por los derechos de millones de americanos aquí en California y, por extensión, en todo los Estados Unidos.Permítanme una observación obvia:No hay otro país como los Estados Unidos.El mundo nos necesita fuerte y listo. El mundo nos busca como líder y socio.Si se cae América, todo el mundo se lastima.El estado de nuestro país decide destinos.¿Cómo puede ser, entonces, que el estado de nuestra joven, rica y fuerte nación ahora es desorden, tensión, hostilidad?¿Cómo puede ser que lo que defina el estado de nuestro país en el año 2019 es el cierre del gobierno a manos del presidente Trump? Y no solo una vez, pero quizás una segunda vez en las próximas semanas.¿Quién pudiera creer que el estado de nuestra unión sea impulsado por una obsesión extravagante del presidente Trump de construir un muro en la frontera que ni los expertos quieren? El presidente ya ni repite su promesa de que México pagaría los miles de millones dólares que cuesta este muro.Y sí todo eso no fuera suficiente para preocuparnos, ¿cómo se explica que nuestra nación vive bajo una intensa investigación sobre la interferencia rusa en nuestras elecciones presidenciales del 2016 y sobre el papel que jugó el presidente Trump?Criminalidad, conspiración, obstrucción de justicia — todas esas sombras oscuras siguen a Donald Trump y a su administración.No es sorpresa que la mayoría del pueblo aquí en los Estados Unidos piensa que el país camina en la dirección equivocada. Y que cuatro de cada 10 americanos creen que este es el peor gobierno que han visto en su vida.Esta noche era para convencernos que, de ahora en adelante, paraba el engaño y la disfunción y que empezaba la cooperación. Lo que escuchamos fue el cansado refrán de ""construir muros"".Si el presidente Trump quisiera avanzar en serio una reforma migratoria integral, incluyendo la seguridad fronteriza, los Demócratas estamos y hemos estado listos. Pero cerrar nuestro gobierno — y dejar sin empleo o pago a cientos de miles de trabajadores — no es la manera de hacerlo.Y la idea de declarar un estado de emergencia en la frontera cuando uno no existe, para justificar robar fondos que le pertenecen a los desamparados de los incendios, inundaciones y huracanes, para pagar por el muro, no solo es inmoral, es ilegal.Estamos listos para rechazar esta propuesta insensata, en la corte, en el momento que toque la tierra.El muro en la frontera no es la única barrera que estamos viendo de esta administración que trata de construir:Ellos también ponen un muro entre usted y su médico, dictando cuales servicios puede recibir. Por eso mis colegas y yo defendemos en la corte a personas como Elizabeth del estado de la Florida. Teniendo cobertura de salud, eso la dejó a ella terminar sus estudios universitarios y aseguró que su marido tuviera cobertura para poder vencer el cáncer. Y ahora, Elizabeth es abogada.También la administración de presidente Trump — ellos construyen un muro entre usted y las urnas de votación. Pero aquí tengo noticias: ¡Fracasaron! En las elecciones de noviembre, Latinos, especialmente los jóvenes, salieron a votar en números históricos. ¡Gracias!¿Qué más? Ellos ponen un muro entre nuestros veteranos y sus servicios médicos. Ellos están listos de malgastar millones de dólares para un muro fronterizo en vez de ayudarles a nuestros veteranos que se enfrentan demasiadas demoras en los hospitales.Y ellos también construyen también un muro entre padres e hijos, al meter a niños en jaulas que los separan de sus padres.Amigos, créanmelo, podemos tumbar muros y abrir puertas con nuestras manos. Es más, ¡ya lo hicimos!¿No me lo creen?Con sus votos el noviembre pasado, ustedes cambiaron la composición del Congreso. Los votos de los congresistas con quienes contaba el presidente, ya no los tiene. Ahora él tiene que aprender lo que es gobernar en una democracia.Ya no puede ignorar a los Demócratas. Y por eso, no tiene su muro.Su voto en noviembre cambió los votos en el Congreso. Y eso ha cambiado la política de nuestra nación.Ahora que ven su poder, ¿están listos para abrir nuevas puertas?¿No les parece que ya es la hora de que nosotros en nuestro gobierno construyemos (sic) escuelas, no muros? ¡Entonces, prepárense, estas manos pueden cambiar mucho! ¡Estas manos pueden cambiar con la próxima votación!Nuestro sistema demócrata premia a la participación de todos. Y con 66,000 ciudadanos Latinos cumpliendo 18 años de edad, la edad de votación, cada mes, tenemos muchas manos que premiar.Imagínense si tuviéramos el poder de decidir la agenda política de esta nación.Mejores escuelas: Check.Un cuidado médico para su familia que los políticos no le pueden quitar: Check.Sueldos con beneficios y protecciones en el empleo: Check.Mejores leyes para proteger nuestras familias y nuestra policía del violento uso de las armas de fuego: Check.Protección permanente para los Soñadores, los Dreamers: Check.Leyes que protegen el agua que tomamos y el aire que respiramos: Check.Y una reforma migratoria integral para reparar el sistema roto: Check. Check. Check.Esta no es la agenda que presentó el presidente. Pero estas son las soluciones que abren puertas de la oportunidad.En las cortes o en el Congreso, o en las urnas de la votación, tenemos que luchar por nuestra agenda. Por eso es que yo he luchado como fiscal general en la corte contra la administración del presidente Trump, ¡y estamos ganando!En proteger el programa de DACA, luchamos y ganamos para los 700,000 jóvenes.En proteger el programa de salud Obamacare, somos los protagonistas. Más de cuatro millones de Latinos dependen en el Obamacare para su seguro médico.En proteger los estudiantes universitarios contra préstamos fraudulentos, luchamos y ganamos por miles de ellos.Hace dos semanas mis padres celebraron 66 años de matrimonio. Empezaron su vida juntos con solo su fe. Todavía recuerdan los días cuando no podían cruzar las puertas de restaurantes debido a los letreros que les decían: ""Los perros o mexicanos, no permitidos"".Con los años, han recibido los premios de su labor y dedicación a su familia. No hay duda de que el ""estado de la unión"" de María Teresa y Manuel Becerra es fuerte y sólido.Si les preguntamos a ellos, mis padres, cuál es el estado de nuestra nación, estoy seguro que pintarían un imagen más real que lo que nos presentó el presidente Trump esta noche. Ellos saben lo que significa trabajar duro y respetar las reglas.Y bien que saben que para mantenernos fuertes como pueblo unido hay que trabajar juntos y mantener abiertas esas pesadas puertas para que todos nuestros hijos – como los estudiantes de C.K. McClatchy – puedan cruzar y conocer la oportunidad.Ya sea con marchas en las calles o marchas a las urnas de votación, con luchas en la corte o a través del Congreso, haremos lo que se necesita para asegurar una unión nacional fuerte y vibrante.Amigos, con fe y la fuerza de nuestra labor, y respetando las diversas contribuciones del pueblo americano, los Estados Unidos seguirá siendo el dueño del sueño americano.Muchas gracias, buenas noches y que Dios los bendiga."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/690345256/fact-check-trumps-state-of-the-union-address","President Trump delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday night, a speech that had been delayed during the government shutdown. The annual remarks came as a bipartisan group of lawmakers continue to negotiate border security funding and Trump's wall proposal — the central issue that led to the longest shutdown in U.S. history.NPR reporters annotated Trump's remarks live, adding context and analysis. Read a fact check of the Democratic response, given by Stacey Abrams, here."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/688043654/watch-live-trump-delivers-state-of-the-union-after-shutdown","Updated Wednesday at 1:05 a.m. ETPresident Trump used his second State of the Union address to call for bipartisanship and unity, even as he remains at an impasse with Congress over immigration in the shadow of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. It was the first time Trump addressed Congress with Democrats controlling the House, though he didn't make an outright nod to the new power balance. The president also didn't mention the 35-day partial government shutdown that preceded — and had initially delayed — his annual address and made only a passing reference to another one that could happen in less than two weeks. Instead, Trump opened by telling lawmakers he was ""ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans"" and by aiming to ""govern not as two parties but as one nation."" ""There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country,"" the president said to a standing ovation from both parties. Trump called on Congress to ""reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good.""""Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future,"" he continued. ""The decision is ours to make.  We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.""However, Trump's rhetoric throughout his presidency — and in the hours ahead of his speech — undercuts that message and could make it hard for his remarks to break through. For example, Tuesday morning the president tweeted that his administration has ""sent additional military"" to the Southern border. ""We will build a Human Wall if necessary,"" Trump also said. ""If we had a real Wall, this would be a non-event!"" That tweet was soon followed by another that targeted the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York.  And not long into his remarks, that tone of comity did fade. Trump condemned Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and whether there was any collusion with Russia — which has led to the arrests and convictions of several former aides. Trump, who has frequently called Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt,"" blamed it for curtailing economic progress.  ""An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,"" Trump said, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visibly reacted behind him. ""If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way! We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.""Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, responded after Trump's speech that the president ""seems to believe that because Congress must legislate, we should not investigate. Of course, the Constitution requires us to do both. That is exactly how it works.""Trump's address comes less than two weeks before another funding deadline that could result in another partial government shutdown. The president has been pessimistic about the chances that a bipartisan group of lawmakers engaged in negotiations will find a palatable solution on border security he would sign. As expected, he made immigration — and his continued argument that a Southern border wall of some type is necessary — a central part of his speech, asking Congress ""to defend our very dangerous Southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.""""We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways,"" Trump said. ""I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.""Trump said his push for a wall would be a ""smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall"" that would ""be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down."" Trump has floated declaring a national emergency as a way to build the wall, which was a key campaign promise — albeit with the caveat that Mexico would pay for it — that drew wild praise from his supporters. But even some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have cautioned that such a declaration would be a risky strategy, drawing likely legal challenges and setting a potentially dangerous precedent for future presidents. The president didn't reference such a declaration in his speech, but he did insist he would ""get it built."" In the Democratic Spanish-language response, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra pushed back forcefully against the possibility of an emergency declaration. ""And the idea of declaring a nonexistent state of emergency on the border, in order to justify robbing funds that belong to the victims of fires, floods, hurricanes, and droughts, to pay for the wall is not only immoral, it is illegal,"" Becerra said. ""We are ready to reject this foolish proposal in court the moment it touches the ground.""The House chamber looked quite different than in past years. Democrats have control of the House for the first time in eight years, with that success coming owing to the record number of women — most of whom wore white Tuesday night in honor of early 20th century suffragists — elected in last year's midterms.As Trump began to tout his economic success, he noted that ""no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year."" The Democratic women began to stand and cheer, egged on by their male colleagues. ""You weren't supposed to do that,"" Trump quipped with a smile, though he urged them to keep standing for his next remarks: ""All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."" That prompted even more cheering and chants of ""USA!"" from the female lawmakers. Ironically, it was, in large part, because of Trump and his policies that many of those Democratic women decided to run for office. Democrats chose former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who fell short in her bid last year to become the country's first black female governor, to give their response to the president's address. She hit Trump especially hard over the prolonged partial shutdown and its effect on workers. ""Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,"" Abrams said about affected federal workers. ""The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people — but our values.""On immigration, she acknowledged that there could be a bipartisan path forward, ""but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart.""""Compassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders. President Reagan understood this. President Obama understood this. Americans understand this. And Democrats stand ready to effectively secure our ports and borders,"" Abrams continued. ""But we must all embrace that from agriculture to health care to entrepreneurship, America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants — not walls.""After losing her race — which was marred by allegations of voter suppression — Abrams launched a voting rights group. She talked about that fight and increasing incidents of racism and white supremacy across the country. ""We fought Jim Crow with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present — which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds — and call racism what it is. Wrong."" Trump did highlight his outreach to African-Americans at various points in his speech, including the bipartisan criminal justice bill that passed last year.""This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community,"" Trump said. ""The First Step Act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.""Two of the president's guests he recognized in his speech were helped by his administration's efforts around rethinking criminal justice issues, including the First Step Act: Alice Johnson, whose sentence Trump commuted last year after she had been given life in prison for being a first-time nonviolent drug offender, and Matthew Charles, who in his two decades before he was released because of the First Step Act mentored inmates and taught Bible study. Other parts of Trump's remarks touched on the economy, foreign policy and improving America's infrastructure. ""After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day,"" Trump argued. Trump has also pushed for withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and drawing down the American military presence in Afghanistan — an idea even Republicans in the Senate have rebuffed. But on Tuesday evening he asserted that ""as a candidate for president, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.""Trump also boasted of his denuclearization efforts with North Korea, claiming that ""if I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.""""Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam,"" he revealed, giving dates for the summit that had been announced last month.Trump also talked about simmering tensions with Venezuela, after the U.S. recently recognized Juan Guaidó as the country's legitimate president over authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro.""We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom — and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair,"" Trump said. He also used that moment in the speech as a segue to a veiled attack on progressives, including self-described Democratic Socialists who were elected to Congress last year. ""Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,"" Trump stated. ""America was founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.""Infrastructure, especially, is an issue where there could be some bipartisan agreement, and Trump told Congress that ""both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure."" However, past efforts by the administration to highlight such efforts have often been overshadowed by controversy or other news. Trump ended his nearly 90-minute address on an optimistic note that somewhat belied the difficulties in the coming days, especially as another partial government shutdown possibly looms — and with a message that could quickly be undercut by whatever the president decides to tweet: ""We must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our inheritance — or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans: We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown . ... I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/04/691471616/as-magnetic-north-pole-zooms-toward-siberia-scientists-update-world-magnetic-mod","North is on the move, and that's a problem for your smartphone's maps.Earth's geographic north pole is fixed. But the planet's magnetic north pole — the north that your compass points toward — wanders in the direction of Siberia at a rate of more than 34 miles per year.That movement may seem slow, but it has forced scientists to update their model of Earth's magnetic field a year earlier than expected so that navigational services, including map-based phone apps, continue to work accurately.The drift results from processes taking place at the center of the planet. Molten iron and nickel slosh and spin in the planet's core, essentially serving as a metallic conductor for Earth's magnetic field. Changes in that fluid flow lead to changes in the magnetic field.As a result of those changes, the accuracy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's World Magnetic Model (WMM) — a mathematical representation of the magnetic field — slowly deteriorates in the five-year periods between updates.The next update was due in 2020. But ""unplanned variations"" have degraded the quality of the WMM so greatly that NOAA published an out-of-cycle update Monday. It was delayed from January by the partial government shutdown.Researchers had known that the model was in trouble for about a year, Nature reports. Arnaud Chulliat, a geomagnetist for NOAA, spoke to a meeting of the American Geophysical Union last year about realizing how inaccurate the model had become.""That was an interesting situation we found ourselves in,"" said Chulliat. ""What's happening?""The explanation was twofold, he said. The pole's continuous movement away from the Canadian Arctic was a problem for the model, as usual. Add in a 2016 geomagnetic pulse beneath South America that shifted the magnetic field, and you had a model too inaccurate to wait for next year's update.The new version of the WMM should stay relatively accurate until the 2020 update comes out as planned.The early release is good news for a wide array of federal, commercial and military services that rely on the model. Services like undersea navigation and air traffic management wouldn't function properly without an accurate model, according to NOAA.Smartphone maps count on magnetic sensors — and the WMM — to figure out the direction of magnetic north. (Think of how Apple and Google Maps show you which way you're facing as you turn a corner or rotate your phone.) And the U.S. Forest Service and NASA rely on the model as well.Earth's magnetic north pole has been moving toward Russia at least since the pole was discovered in 1831, according to NOAA.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/02/05/691374149/bipartisan-support-builds-for-limits-on-surprise-medical-bills","Surrounded by patients who told horror stories of being stuck with hefty bills, President Trump recently waded into a widespread health care problem for which almost all people — even those with insurance — are at risk: surprise medical billing.Trump's declaration that taming unexpected bills would be a top priority for his administration echoed through the halls of Congress, where a handful of Republican and Democratic lawmakers had already been studying the problem.The sudden presidential interest has lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressing optimism about attacking a problem that has affected 57 percent of American adults, according to a University of Chicago survey conducted in August 2018.  Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the influential Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, recently told reporters that he expects to see surprise-billing legislation ""in the next several months.""Alexander is encouraged by the movement, said a committee spokesman — giving a particular nod to the efforts of Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. ""The chairman looks forward to reviewing their work and hopes it leads to a bipartisan consensus on how to address the issue,"" the spokesman added.""Indications in Congress have always been that this would be something they could do on a bipartisan basis,"" said Paul Ginsburg, a health economist at the Brookings Institution.Attention to surprise billing, which involves charging patients for care that is more expensive than expected or not covered by their insurance, has grown following an ongoing Kaiser Health News-NPR Bill of the Month project.Still, the details of a possible solution remain up in the air.The Trump administration hasn't laid out precisely how it would take on surprise bills. But key lawmakers, including Alexander and Cassidy, have met with administration officials to discuss the problem of how to reduce health care costs. Trump administration officials have made it clear that they are looking at surprise billing within this context.With an eye toward drafting legislation, these two senators and several others have been consulting with billing experts, as well as state and local officials, about the biggest challenges and most promising approaches being used around the country.And though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has yet to address the issue, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it would be a priority.""Ending surprise billing is an important part of Democrats' ongoing effort to lower out-of-pocket health costs, and we'll be working on it in the coming Congress,"" said Henry Connelly, a Pelosi spokesman.Previously introduced bills would impose new notification requirements, as well as limitations on what doctors and hospitals might charge patients. They would regulate bills for either emergency care at an out-of-network facility or nonemergency care when the facility is in network but the doctor isn't.To draw attention to the issue, Hassan intends to bring to this week's State of the Union address a guest who was billed more than $1,600 for a trip to an in-network emergency room. The patient learned after the fact that the doctor she briefly saw there was out of network.""There does seem to be across-the-board understanding that what's happening to patients right now isn't right or fair,"" Hassan said.Other members of Congress, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., are expected to bring guests with painful, personal stories regarding the high cost of prescription drugs.  For its part, the administration says its commitment to addressing surprise medical bills is firm.""President Trump has identified surprise medical bills as a serious concern of the administration. Protecting patients from these outrageous and unexpected bills and charges is a top priority for Secretary [Alex] Azar,"" said Caitlin Oakley, a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman.Hassan said she hasn't heard from the White House. But as Congress shifts its focus away from the partial government shutdown, she predicted, surprise billing could emerge as a legislative priority. She said that she and Cassidy have coordinated on the issue.Both Hassan's and Cassidy's bills ""would go a long way toward protecting patients,"" suggested Zack Cooper, a Yale University health economist who researches surprise billing. Hassan's legislation, he said, has the additional benefit of likely bringing down health care costs. ""There are a lot of issues that can't be fixed or at least can't be fixed easily. This is an issue that causes immense pain and is quite visceral and can be fixed,"" Cooper said.And federal legislation is likely necessary, experts say. Some states have passed laws meant to curb surprise billing and protect patients from the costs — but those laws don't apply to self-insured large employers, which fall under federal jurisdiction and affect more than 60 percent of people who get insurance through work. The presidential bully pulpit could be hugely influential — in particular, Ginsburg suggested, by ""leaning on Congress"" to bring legislation to Trump's desk. And new legislation probably is the most effective vehicle. It's unclear what kind of executive action HHS could take without Congress.""Some creative lawyers could come up with creative interpretations [of existing laws] and lead to smart policy,"" said Barak Richman, a Duke University law school professor who focuses on health policy.But reinterpreting federal law would almost certainly invite legal challenges, he added.Already, competing industry groups are lobbying to put their stamp on any federal policy. The emergency physicians trade group has backed an approach like Hassan's, while the insurance lobby is calling for a Cassidy-style bill. When asked about the industry's response, Hassan said she has gotten ""a variety of feedback — as you would expect.""Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. It is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that isn't affiliated with Kaiser Permanente."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/691368262/what-to-know-ahead-of-trumps-state-of-the-union-address","Updated at 2:05 p.m. ETPresident Trump will deliver his second State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday night. He's expected to deliver a bipartisan message themed around ""choosing greatness,"" while outlining what the White House calls a ""policy agenda both parties can rally behind.""Trump's address will begin at 9 p.m. ET (you can watch and listen via NPR). His remarks will be followed by two responses: former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will deliver the Democratic response, and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will give the Spanish-language remarks. The tradition of the speech traces back to the Constitution, which calls for the president to ""from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union."" The televised responses began in 1966.But the circumstances around Tuesday night's remarks are unusual. (We'll get to that in a minute.)What's going to happen?Trump is set to outline his agenda while facing a new reality: a House chamber controlled by Democrats. While it's likely he will reiterate his demands for billions of dollars in funding for a wall along the southern U.S. border, Trump could also use the address to make a pitch for more bipartisan issues, including health care, infrastructure and economic growth. Also notable during Trump's speech? Who's there to watch. People on different sides of the immigration debate, climate change experts and federal workers affected by the recent government shutdown are among lawmakers' guests. After Trump's speech, Abrams will deliver the Democratic response. Seen as a rising star within the Democratic Party after her 2018 gubernatorial campaign, she's considered a possible challenger to Georgia GOP Sen. David Perdue in 2020.Democrats will look to jump-start their legislative agenda after the State of the Union after facing a delay due to the partial government shutdown. House Democrats have begun introducing a series of bills, including legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap and a bill to overhaul campaign finance and ethics rules.   How did we get here?Things started off in a normal fashion — on Jan. 4, newly minted Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., invited Trump to deliver the State of the Union in the House chamber on Jan. 29. But that's where ""business as usual"" stopped. On Jan. 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump calling for the speech to be postponed until the shutdown, which had begun on Dec. 22, was over. In her letter, Pelosi cited ""security concerns,"" as the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security were both affected by the shutdown. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen dismissed those concerns, and Republican lawmakers were quick to slam Pelosi's decision. In what appeared to be a retaliatory move one day later, Trump postponed a congressional delegation's trip to Afghanistan at the last minute, writing, ""I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.""""I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown,"" Trump wrote to Pelosi, who was on a bus with other lawmakers departing for the trip when the president sent his letter.The back-and-forth escalated from there, with Pelosi's office accusing the White House of leaking the delegation's plans to complete the trip via commercial travel. The White House denied the allegation, calling it ""outrageous.""Trump later took to Twitter, saying he was ""still thinking"" about the speech and indicating he was prepared to give the speech in the House regardless of Pelosi's urging. White House officials confirmed as much, telling NPR they requested a security walk-through as though the speech would still take place on Jan. 29. That prompted Pelosi to send another letter to the president, this time more forceful in her language.""I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,"" she wrote.Later that evening, Trump acquiesced, tweeting that he would deliver the address ""when the Shutdown is over.""Just two days later, Trump signed a bill to bring a (temporary) end to the 35-day shutdown, and the following week, Pelosi extended an invitation for Trump to address Congress on Feb. 5.

Lawmakers, along with the president and first lady, pick guests every year to highlight or protest the policies of an administration.First lady's boxHeadlining the president's guest list is Matthew Charles.In 2016, after serving 21 years in prison, Charles won early release. He got a job and started volunteering, but less than two years later he was sent back to prison after an appeals court found there had been a mistake with his release.He was released from prison again earlier this year, just weeks after Trump signed the First Step Act into law. The criminal justice law, which reduced sentences for certain federal drug crimes, among other provisions, may be Trump's crowning bipartisan achievement from his first two years in office.In a nod to Melania Trump's ""Be Best"" initiative, she will also host a sixth-grader named Joshua Trump who ""has been bullied in school due to his last name.""The first lady's guests also include a young cancer survivor, a lumber plant manager who benefited from the new tax law and a survivor of the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.Both sides of immigration debateSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said he will ""highlight the human suffering"" caused by the president's immigration policy by bringing Albertina Contreras Teletor and Yakelin Garcia Contreras, a mother and daughter who were separated at the Southern border last year.Yakelin, who turns 12 on Tuesday, was separated from her mother for nearly two months before they were reunited.""This child separation policy came from a dark and evil place within the heart of this administration,"" Merkley said in a statement.Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., will bring Sandra Diaz, a former undocumented immigrant who worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., for a number of years.But Trump will have his share of supporters for his hard-line approach to immigration as well.Representative Chip Roy, R-Texas, is inviting Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council. Trump thanked Judd on Twitter in January for speaking in support of building a wall along the Southern border.Another Texan, Republican Sen. John Cornyn, is inviting Manny Padilla, the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector chief, an aide in Cornyn's office confirmed to NPR.Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Rep. Tim Burchett are bringing Knoxville Fire Department Capt. D.J. Corcoran and Wendy Corcoran. They are the parents of Pierce Corcoran, 22, who died in a car accident in December 2018. Corcoran was in a car crash with a driver who is an undocumented immigrant and who has been charged with negligent homicide and driving without a license or insurance.The accident has fueled the ongoing national debate over illegal immigration.""The tragedy the Corcoran family has endured is one no family should ever have to experience,"" Blackburn said. ""The attendance of Pierce's parents at the State of the Union serves as a reminder that we, as a Congress, have a duty to keep the American people safe.""Shutdown relatedThe recent partial government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history — has prompted Democrats including Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to bring federal workers affected by the shutdown.Van Hollen is working on legislation to give federal contractors back pay.""It's time to send a message to President Trump and Senate Republicans: federal and contract workers are the backbone of our economy and their livelihoods should never be used as pawns in Republican political games,"" Warren said in a statement.Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., will bring Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, an air traffic control specialist who lost her home in a 2017 wildfire and who was also furloughed.Other Democratic statementsFreshman rising star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is bringing Ana Maria Archila, a community activist and sexual assault survivor who confronted then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in an elevator over his support for then-Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The emotional moment was caught by TV cameras and quickly went viral, although it did not ultimately affect Kavanaugh's confirmation or Flake's support for it.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., are both bringing guests to protest the Trump administration's ban on transgender people serving in the military.Gillibrand is bringing Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann, the first openly transgender service member to be promoted, and Pappas is bringing Tavion Dignard, a transgender man and retired Navy veteran.""Denying transgender Americans their right to serve this country is a disgrace,"" Pappas said. ""They deserve equal treatment by their government and the law.""A handful of House Democrats, including Georgia Rep. John Lewis, plan to skip the speech entirely, according to The Hill."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/05/690653384/in-the-shadow-of-the-wall-trump-will-deliver-the-state-of-the-union","President Trump's second State of the Union address will be delivered Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress with all the usual pomp and circumstance. But the political backdrop is unusual, coming in the aftermath of the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history and on the eve of what could be another vicious fight or even another shutdown. The fight at the heart of the shutdown — the fight over the president's border wall — remains unresolved with the clock ticking to make a deal. White House officials are previewing a conciliatory tone from the president, as they have done before previous addresses to Congress that didn't turn out to be so conciliatory after all. As part of a briefing with reporters at which a senior official detailed what to expect from the speech but declined to speak on the record, the official read an excerpt of Trump's prepared remarks.""Together we can break decades of political stalemate,"" the official said Trump will say. ""We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.""This comes in stark contrast to the uncertainty and bitterness of the moment. There is uncertainty about whether a bipartisan congressional conference committee can reach an agreement to fund border security and avoid another government shutdown. The bitterness is displayed in part in Trump's own rhetoric about that key fight. In an interview with CBS News that aired during the Super Bowl, Trump said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., resisted his demands for $5.7 billion to build a wall (or border barrier) because ""she doesn't mind human trafficking or she wouldn't do this.""  ""The wall is actually a wall against getting anything else done""During the record-setting 35 days of the shutdown, the president didn't stop talking about the wall. At an American Farm Bureau Federation conference, even in Iraq to greet troops the day after Christmas, the wall was a focus.""The wall is actually a wall against getting anything else done at this point,"" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist who has worked with the Trump administration. Bonjean points out that while the wall and shutdown have been nearly all-consuming for Trump, they have temporarily stymied the ambitious agenda of House Democrats too. Bonjean says he expects Trump to throw down the gauntlet on the wall to prove that even if he lost Round 1, he doesn't intend to lose during Round 2. ""He has to demand funding for his wall,"" Bonjean says. ""It would be malpractice for him not to.""And a State of the Union address gives the president a big moment on the national stage to make his pitch for the wall. At the same time, White House aides say other items on the president's agenda have withered in the shadow of the wall fight.Beyond the borderAmericans want to hear more than just immigration, Bonjean argues. ""They want to hear solutions to health care, to infrastructure, to data privacy, foreign policy. You name it.""Trump mentioned those issues in a news conference held the day after the midterm elections in November. ""Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs,"" Trump said. ""These are some of the things that the Democrats do want to work on.""But in the midst of all this partisan rancor, can Trump actually walk into the House chamber, stand in front of Pelosi and act as though this is just a normal address in a normal time? He wouldn't be the first president to do so. Reset, dig in or unify?In 1998, President Bill Clinton's State of the Union completely ignored the sex scandal swirling around his presidency, says Russell Riley 0f the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. ""By dint of his speaking skills and his personality, he was able to go in and change the tone of the debate,"" Riley says. ""There are a lot of people within the Clinton White House that felt that that saved his presidency.""It's not the same situation, but Riley thinks this speech presents an opportunity for Trump. He could reset his presidency, laying out new agenda items for the year to come and touting the accomplishments of the past two years.Or he could dig in further to aggravate emotions over the border wall. There's a third option, too. Trump could do what almost every president has done in these addresses: talk about finding common ground.Based on what White House aides are telegraphing, he may try to do all three. If history is a guide, with Trump the most combative parts will be most resonant.And it may just be too late and too toxic for bipartisan cooperation. Many of the president's allies are convinced that the Democrats are unwilling to give him a victory on anything large or small just because Trump is Trump.And the president is so focused on keeping his base with him that he may have a hard time compromising with Democrats."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/04/690812716/house-democrats-play-catch-up-on-agenda-after-shutdown","Democrats officially took control of the House of Representatives one month ago with a promise of moving quickly on a fresh agenda centered on protecting health care and making Washington work better.Until last week, those plans were on pause. Committees couldn't form, legislation stalled and their whole message was about ending the shutdown. Now, as Washington returns to legislating with a three-week period to focus on a spending deal, Democrats are working to catch up before Trump takes center stage with a prime-time State of the Union address delivered from their home turf — the House floor.""There's no question that the government shutdown consumed everyone's attention,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. ""The president I think did that purposefully.""Cicilline, who leads a team of Democrats tasked with setting policy and messaging priorities, said he believes Trump deliberately timed the shutdown to take the wind out of Democrats' sails.But Cicilline and other top Democrats say that's changing now. Committee members have been announced, staff is coming on board and Democrats have begun to introduce a backlog of bills, like a revival of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap.That legislation, paired with HR 1, a bill to reform campaign and ethics rules, were the backbone of Democrats' messaging in the single week of open government before the State of the Union.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., says members will have even more chances to make their mark in the weeks to come.""There's this frustration about focusing on the negative aspect of shutting down the government of the United States of America,"" Hoyer said in an interview with NPR. ""But I think they're going to feel a lot better four months from now because I think we're going to have dealt with a lot of very substantive issues that we talked about in the campaign.""Hoyer says committees are getting ready to take up plans to lower the cost of prescription drugs and move bills designed to retrain workers and get more people higher paying jobs.And some Democratic lawmakers say they have the opportunity to launch their agenda with new attention now that the shutdown is over. Democrats in Congress have higher than usual approval ratings after the shutdown, and polls showed a majority of voters sided with Democrats in that fight.Members like Progressive Caucus Co-chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., say that gives Democrats a powerful platform.""We didn't back down on this president and we showed that we will hold him accountable,"" Jayapal said. ""That got us enormous credibility with the American public.But that may not be helpful for many of the more moderate Democrats who won tough races in previously Republican districts on promises to overcome gridlock.That's why losing the early weeks of legislating has been particularly frustrating for a lot of freshmen. They wanted a head start before the State of the Union, where Trump will set his own agenda.And their class co-chair, Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, says his fellow newbies are itching to show their constituents that they can deliver on their campaign promises.""We are the class that delivered the majority and we are the class that I think in many ways is closest to the people,"" Allred said. ""We want to make sure folks that have been here are aware of what our priorities are.""Specifically, Allred says Democrats want to protect pre-existing conditions, the defining issue that helped them win this new majority. Focusing narrowly on policies with broad support also helps Democrats avoid internal bickering over more complicated issues — like the finer details of how far left the party can go in embracing a ""Medicare-for-all"" proposal.""Those are things that no matter where you are on the spectrum you have a common denominator of agreement,"" Allred said. ""Those complicated areas — like how far left to go on Medicare-for-all will wait.""Plus, as Hoyer and Jayapal are quick to remind members, there's still lots of time before the 2020 election begins.""A lot of members just spent the last year, two years in some cases, campaigning, so a few weeks feels like a lifetime,"" Jayapal said. ""We're in January, we're not in June. If this is still the case in June that would be a problem."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/03/691083009/in-super-bowl-interview-trump-goes-on-offense","President Trump renewed his call for border wall funding and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of ""rigid"" opposition, in an interview airing two days before Trump's State of the Union address.The tone of the president's remarks in an interview taped Friday with CBS calls into question whether Trump will actually use Tuesday's primetime speech to appeal for compromise, as advertised.""When you have drugs pouring in, and when you have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi who don't want to give proper border security for political reasons, she's doing a terrible disservice to our country,"" Trump said, during the interview with Face the Nation.The president suggested he might declare an emergency in order to secure border wall funding without congressional approval. He also left the door open to another government shutdown.Pelosi's spokesman responded, saying Trump's earlier shutdown had undermined security by denying paychecks to border patrol agents and other frontline personnel.""The president's wild and predictable misrepresentations about Democrats' commitment to border security do nothing to make our country safer,"" spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement.Trump also defended his plans to withdraw troops from Syria and reduce the U.S. deployment in Afghanistan, despite warnings last week from his intelligence experts that ISIS and al Qaida continue to pose a threat.Senate Republicans also counseled the president to avoid a precipitous withdrawal. But Trump appeared unfazed, saying he was simply keeping his campaign promises not to act as the world's policeman.""I ran against 17 Republicans. This was a big part of what I was saying, and I won very easily,"" Trump said. ""I think people in our country agree. We've been fighting for 19 years.""Trump added the he plans to maintain a troop presence in Iraq, where they can respond rapidly to events in the surrounding area, while also monitoring Iran.""We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly,"" Trump said.Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned last month after Trump announced his plan to pull troops out of Syria. The president insisted that Mattis did so at his urging.""He resigned because I asked him to resign,"" Trump said. ""I gave him big budgets and he didn't do well in Afghanistan.""In the interview, parts of which will air during the Super Bowl pre-game show, Trump repeated his argument that pro football players should not kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. He suggested that new league rules against such demonstrations contributed to a rebound in the NFL's TV ratings this season.Trump said he loves watching football but worries about the danger of the game and would not encourage his youngest son, Barron to play.""Would I steer him that way? No, I wouldn't,"" Trump said, noting that Barron prefers soccer."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/03/690523901/democrats-tap-leader-of-resistance-to-trump-for-spanish-state-of-the-union-respo","Updated on Feb. 6 at 1:40 a.m. ETCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra — the son of immigrants, who has sued the Trump administration 45 times over a wide range of issues — will deliver the Spanish-language response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday.Becerra was tapped by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., along with former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, who will give her response to Trump's speech in English.Becerra, 61, is well-known to Pelosi, who served with Becerra from the time he was elected to Congress in 1992 until he left to become attorney general in 2017. During his 24 years in the House, Becerra rose through the ranks to become chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, making him the highest-ranking Latino in Congress.""Attorney General Becerra is a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every American's right to quality, affordable health care, and we all look forward to his strong message of progress for all American families and communities,"" said Pelosi.In a statement Becerra said, ""I'm looking forward to addressing my fellow Americans on a day when truth, candor and unity should be the order of the day. There is enough good going on in this country that we don't need to hide behind misrepresentations to describe the State of our Union.""Becerra became California's first Latino attorney general when he was nominated by Gov. Jerry Brown to fill out the term of Attorney General Kamala Harris, after she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. Becerra was born in Sacramento, Calif., to immigrant parents from Mexico. The first in his family to attend college, Becerra earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Stanford University, where he also later received a law degree.In an interview with KQED's Political Breakdown program in July 2018, Becerra said Trump's descriptions of Mexican immigrants as ""rapists and murderers"" reminded him of the kinds of treatment his parents had to endure.""One thing that I've learned is that while my parents had to put up with some of these indignities, these injustices — my dad couldn't walk into a restaurant because of the signs that said 'No dogs or Mexicans allowed' even though he was a U.S. citizen — so when you hear someone like Donald Trump say those vile things you absorb, you remember, but then you try to move forward as best you can,"" Becerra said, adding that part of moving forward is learning to ""punch back.""Since taking office in January 2017, Becerra has punched back in court dozens of times. On his own or in concert with other state attorneys general, Becerra has sued the Trump administration over the administration's travel ban on citizens of predominantly Muslim countries, threats to sanctuary jurisdictions protecting undocumented immigrants, clean air standards, women's access to reproductive health services and offshore oil drilling.In doing so, he has helped cement California's image as leader of  ""the resistance"" to the Trump administration. In November of last year, California voters overwhelmingly elected him to a full four-year term.Becerra is not the first to deliver a Spanish-language response to the State of the Union. That distinction goes to then-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson in 2004. Two other Florida lawmakers were subsequently chosen by Republicans to deliver a response in Spanish, Sen. Marco Rubio in 2013, followed by Ros-Lehtinen again in 2014, and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart in 2016. Ros-Lehtinen decided not to seek another term last year and her seat was flipped to the Democrats by former Clinton administration Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.Democrats continued the tradition in 2018 when Elizabeth Guzman, a Peruvian-American member of the Virginia House of Delegates, gave the official Democratic response in Spanish. In 2017, it was Astrid Silva, an immigration rights activist and DREAMer from Nevada. President Trump will deliver his State of the Union address Feb. 5, after a one-week delay initiated by Speaker Pelosi withdrawing her invitation to have the president speak during the recent partial government shutdown.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/690813842/white-house-says-state-of-the-union-will-be-bipartisan-pitch-even-as-shutdown-lo","President Trump will take a bipartisan approach in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, the White House said, even as another possible government shutdown looms and he threatens to use an emergency declaration to build a border wall.A senior administration official told reporters on Friday that ""choosing greatness"" will be the theme for the Feb. 5 address, which will outline a ""policy agenda both parties can rally behind."" ""Together we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make,"" Trump will say, according to an early excerpt of his speech. However, that pitch belies the deep divisions right now not only between Republicans and Democrats, but between Trump and Congress. The president's attacks against Democrats and their leaders rose after a bruising midterm election in which Democrats flipped control of the House and then refused to pass a spending deal that included money for a border wall.That was the backdrop for the longest shutdown in American history that left about 800,000 government workers without pay for 35 days. Trump had insisted upon funding for a long-promised wall along the Mexican border that he says will curtail illegal immigration, but last Friday he agreed to a three-week funding bill — without wall money — while a bipartisan group of legislators on Capitol Hill try to reach a compromise on border security. But Trump has frequently sounded pessimistic about the group's efforts. Earlier on Friday, he continued to hint he might circumvent Congress all together to build his wall via an emergency declaration, a move that would almost certainly face a legal challenge. The senior administration official wouldn't comment on whether Trump would talk about declaring a national emergency or do it outright on Tuesday, but the president himself seemed to hint as much earlier on Friday. ""I don't want to say. But you'll hear the State of the Union, and then you'll see what happens right after the State of the Union,"" Trump told reporters. When asked directly if he was going to make an emergency declaration during his speech, the president replied, ""Well, I'm saying listen closely to the State of the Union. I think you'll find it very exciting.""""I think there's a good chance that we'll have to do that, but we will at the same time be building, regardless, we're building the wall. And we're building a lot of wall, but I can do it a lot faster the other way,"" Trump added. Immigration and border security will be one of five major areas the president intends to focus on during the State of the Union, the senior administration official said. Other areas Trump plans to touch on are trade and American workers, including pushing for Congress to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which would replace the North American Free Trade Act; rebuilding America through infrastructure investment; lowering the cost of health care and prescription drugs; and diplomatic and military efforts across the world, including ""ending our endless foreign wars.""Trump is scheduled to deliver the address to a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday. It had been slated for Jan. 29 but then was delayed because of the shutdown. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/02/01/690616787/concealed-by-cucumbers-massive-fentanyl-stash-found-in-produce-truck-in-arizona","Updated at 3:45 p.m. ETU.S. Customs and Border Protection says its agents seized a record amount of fentanyl Saturday from a produce truck attempting to enter the country from Mexico at Arizona's Port of Nogales crossing. Buried under piles of cucumbers, lay some 254 pounds of fentanyl, worth around $3.5 million, officials announced Thursday. Agents also discovered nearly 395 pounds of methamphetamine, valued at $1.1 million.The drugs were stashed in a special floor compartment in the trailer, according to CBP, which said the fentanyl seizure is the biggest in the agency's history.When the truck driver arrived at the U.S. through the Mariposa Port of Entry Cargo Facility in Nogales, CBP officers conducted a scan ""and observed anomalies under the floor of the tractor,"" according to court documents. Then a drug sniffing dog picked up an odor coming from the rear of the trailer.The driver was identified in the court documents as Juan Antonio Torres-Barraza, a 26-year-old Mexican national. He was arrested and charged with two counts of possession with intent to distribute.Torres told authorities that he ""did not know there were narcotics in the trailer,"" and that he thought he was simply hauling cucumbers in a truck that he does not own, according to the criminal complaint.Juan Mariscal, assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security's Nogales office indicated that the drug smuggling attempt was part of an organized operation. ""They know what they're doing,"" Mariscal said without providing further details, citing the ongoing investigation.""We've seen this type of compartment before,"" Nogales Area Port Director Michael Humphries said of the false floor that hid the drugs.Standing alongside some of the 426 seized packages of drugs stacked in neat piles, federal officials touted the seizure during a news conference Thursday.""Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more powerful than morphine,"" Humphries said, adding that a few grains could prove lethal. ""This past weekend our CBP officers were able to stop an enormous amount of these deadly narcotics from hitting our streets.""Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has been a leading cause of overdose deaths in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""Opioids pose a real danger to every community in America and are having fatal consequences across our nation,"" Humphries said.President Trump has repeatedly invoked the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico as part of his pitch for an additional $5.7 billion for a border wall. ""Most of our drugs come in through the southern border,"" he told reporters last month ahead of a trip to Texas. ""And they don't come in through the portals, they come in between the portals where you have no barrier.""But Humphries said that like Thursday's record seizure, ""most hard narcotics seized [by] CBP are at the ports of entry.""Humphries said the recent partial government shutdown over funding for a border wall had taken a toll on agents, but that ""even during difficult times, such as our funding hiatus,"" they continue to demonstrate professionalism and commitment to the job.But starting Feb. 15, agents may experience another salary hiatus if negotiations on a border deal once again prove fruitless.As NPR has reported, lawmakers in Washington have ""a Feb. 15 deadline to get a bill to the president or agree to another stopgap funding bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, another partial government shutdown looms.""Mariscal said drug smugglers will carry on whether the U.S. government is open or not.""They continue with their operations just like we do."""

The string of job growth underscores the long economic expansion since the Great Recession.The unemployment rate inched up to 4 percent, and the shutdown contributed to the uptick, the department said.Don't see the graphic above? Click herePrivate economists had expected an increase of about 170,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to be unchanged at 3.9 percent.In December, the economy added a revised 222,000 jobs. That was less than the blockbuster 312,000 first reported, and it followed the revised 176,000 jobs added in November.Gains occurred in a number of sectors: Leisure and hospitality added 74,000 jobs, construction 52,000, health care 42,000, retail nearly 21,000 and manufacturing 13,000.Wage growth held steady in January. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2 percent over the past 12 months — matching December's increase. Workers earned an average of $27.56 an hour last month.The 35-day partial government shutdown, which ended Jan. 25, affected hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors. But because of a bill signed into law by President Trump on Jan. 16, federal employees who were furloughed or required to work without pay were guaranteed back pay after the shutdown ended. Those workers were counted as employed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.Still, the Labor Department said that the number of people employed part time who wanted to work full time jumped by about 500,000, to 5.1 million, in January. ""Nearly all of this increase occurred in the private sector and may reflect the impact of the partial federal government shutdown,"" it said.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will cut economic growth by 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019, although some of that will be recouped later in the year.The Federal Reserve, which keeps a close eye on the employment numbers, said Wednesday that the labor market has continued to strengthen since December. The central bank, which raised rates four times last year, did not raise rates and cited ""global economic and financial developments"" and low U.S. inflation as reasons to be patient before changing rates again.""The respectable employment data provides something of a relief, for now at least, for members of the Federal Reserve who have been bracing for the possibility of a more serious slowdown in the U.S. economy,"" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689934705/fed-says-u-s-growth-is-solid-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged","Updated at 5:30 p.m. ETThe economy is growing at a ""solid rate"" and inflation is hovering near the Federal Reserve's target, the central bank said Wednesday. As expected, the Fed did not raise its key interest rate. But in a reversal from December, the Fed said it will be ""patient"" as it decides when to change them again. The announcement came at the end of a scheduled two-day meeting, the first of the new year. The Fed's closely watched decisions can affect interest rates on everything from credit cards to mortgages, as well as the rates banks pay savers.In their statement, Fed policymakers said the labor market has continued to strengthen, ""economic activity has been rising at a solid rate"" and spending by households ""has continued to grow strongly."" ""In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, [the Fed's policy committee] will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate,"" the Fed said. In a news conference after the announcement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said trade tensions, Brexit and the recently ended government shutdown raised uncertainties for the economy. He also noted that business and consumer sentiment had declined in recent surveys, giving the Fed further reasons to be cautious.While still low, the unemployment rate inched up to 3.9 percent in December as more people felt confident enough to quit their jobs and look for new ones. The employment report for January is scheduled to be released Friday.The Fed raised rates four times in 2018 — the latest time in December, when it boosted the federal funds rate to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. It was widely expected to keep gradually raising rates in 2019. But since the beginning of the year some Fed officials have backed a more patient approach, putting rate increases on hold until a clearer picture of the economy emerges.  Powell has said that, with inflation ""low and under control,"" at around the Fed's target of 2 percent, policymakers can take their time before raising rates. ""You should anticipate that we're going to be patient and watching,"" Powell said in an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., earlier this month. The Fed's statement Wednesday, saying policymakers ""will be patient,"" echoed those remarks. It marked a reversal from December, when the Fed signaled that ""some further gradual increases"" were coming.President Trump has frequently bashed the Fed for raising rates and hurting economic growth — raising concerns that the president's attacks threaten the central bank's independence. In an effort to stabilize markets and the economy during the financial crisis, the Fed cut rates to nearly zero in 2008. It kept rates at historic lows until late 2015, when it slowly began to raise them.Investors have been eager to see whether the Fed will slow down the pace of rate increases. When the Fed raised rates Dec. 19, stock indexes fell sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing down 352 points, or 1.5 percent, after being up earlier in the day. But the Dow has risen nearly 1,700 points since then.On Wednesday, major stock indexes rallied after the Fed's announcement. The Dow ended the day up 434 points, or about 1.8 percent; it had been up about 250 points shortly before the Fed released its decision.NPR's Uri Berliner contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689932941/border-security-talks-begin-on-capitol-hill","Updated at 5:45 p.m. ETA formal committee of congressional negotiators held its first, and maybe only, public meeting on Wednesday to kick off talks to reach a border security deal that President Trump will support.Leaders from both sides of the aisle sounded open to compromise. Democrats and Republicans on the House-Senate panel stressed they were not far apart on  a plan to give the Department of Homeland Security additional resources to boost personnel, technology and other efforts to secure the Southwest border. But any talk of broader immigration reforms that Democrats would like in exchange for the president's demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall were set aside to drill down on a narrow spending deal.In opening remarks, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., signaled a willingness to back more than the $1.6 billion previously appropriated for border security. And Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said pieces of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could be ""strategically placed"" and don't necessarily have to be from ""coast to coast"" but simply ""strategically placed where traffic is highest."" Appropriators are generally the most seasoned and bipartisan negotiators in Congress, and they could reach a border deal on their own more easily if not for the uncertainty of the president and his insistence on funds for a border wall. ""I know that the American people are counting on us to come to a reasonable and responsible solution. We are appropriators, and consistent with the proud tradition of our committees, I am confident that we will be able to reach a compromise,"" Lowey said. ""As long as we remain polarized, we will never resolve our differences on this critical issue that we owe to the American people,"" Shelby said. Wednesday's meeting was open to the public, but future talks are expected to go on in private. The conference committee has a Feb. 15 deadline to get a bill to the president or agree to another stopgap funding bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, another partial government shutdown looms.The conference committee is made up of lawmakers who sit on the House and Senate appropriations committees and are charged with writing the annual 12 spending bills that fund the U.S. government. Seven of the 12 bills remain unresolved, although the partial government shutdown centered on just one: the DHS funding bill. Other top members of the committee talked about expanded funding for additional border agents and more technology such as drones — possible areas of agreement — though many still stuck somewhat to party talking points. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee, suggested adding more customs agents at ports of entry, noting that these are where most smuggled drugs and other contraband come through, and she stressed more money is needed for combating the humanitarian crisis at the border caused by family separations and detention centers, where two children have died. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the subcommittee, said he still believes a ""physical barrier is needed,"" though that's not all. ""I do think we need a wall, a physical barrier, where the barrier works, but that's only one part of it,"" Fleischmann said. ""We need all of the above."" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a Senate appropriator, underscored that for these talks to work, both sides must give: ""Doing our job, by definition, means nobody gets everything they want.""The panel was born out of the deal reached last week to end the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history. Trump relented on his demand for wall funding to reopen the government, but he refuses to take another shutdown threat off the table. Speaking to reporters before the meeting began, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who sits on the conference committee, said the president must also be on board and criticized Trump for the looming possibility of another shutdown if talks don't succeed. ""It would be helpful if the president was on board to reach a successful conclusion on this debate,"" Durbin said. ""The president threatens to give us another shutdown if we don't cave to him. That's no way to sit down at the table and have a rational conclusion."" The president weighed in Wednesday morning on Twitter, telling lawmakers they are ""Wasting their time!"" if ""Wall or Physical Barrier"" funding is not included in the deal. In his remarks last Friday as the government shutdown finally ended, Trump did signal some flexibility, saying that ""we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shiny sea."" But he has continued to push for his idea of a wall, and it's unclear how little wall or fencing he would accept. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that he thought the odds were ""less than 50-50"" of the congressional appropriators reaching a compromise. Top House Democrats have shown some willingness to negotiate. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters on Tuesday that Democrats could support fencing in certain areas if it is ""evidence based"" and recommended by border experts.Congressional Republicans are eager to reach a deal that can appease the president and head off the possibility that he tries to invoke emergency powers to end-run around Congress to build a wall. ""I'm for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday. ""Exactly how to do that, as you all know, has been quite challenging."" Negotiators initially wrestled with the scope of the talks, with lawmakers divided on whether they should include broader immigration issues — such as extending protections to people in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — or stick strictly to funding questions. But after the first round of negotiations on Wednesday, both sides seemed on the same page — focusing on the specifics of the kinds of programs they should fund and at what levels."

But 22 investigations never even began. That includes 15 aviation accidents resulting in 21 fatalities; three marine accidents; two railroad accidents causing two fatalities; and two highway accidents, which killed seven people.""The 22 accidents in which the NTSB did not launch investigators, but would have if not for the partial shutdown, may not result in investigators physically visiting the accident sites, and, it is possible that perishable evidence may have been lost, which potentially could prevent determination of probable cause,"" the agency said Monday.More than 90 percent of the NTSB's staff — 367 out of 397 employees — were furloughed during the shutdown, though four were recalled without pay to help investigate international aviation accidents, the agency said. During the shutdown work stopped on more than 1,800 ongoing aviation investigations, as well as dozens of others rail, marine and highway investigations.It's hard to investigate a crash that happened weeks ago, former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker told the Associated Press. ""Those are accidents that we really should have looked at and were not able to do that now because it's gone,"" he said. ""Without physically having an opportunity to look at it yourself, you really don't get the exposure to it.""The highway crash that killed seven happened in early January in northern Florida. As NPR reported: ""a semitruck and a car traveling north along Interstate 75 near Gainesville collided, crashed through the center guardrails and smashed into a southbound semitruck and a church van carrying the children. The trucks burst into flames. Another car then slammed into the wreckage."" Among those killed were five children from Louisiana on their way to Disney World. NTSB wouldn't be able to start examining the crash until the government reopened, NPR reported.The NTSB has to decide now whether to physically visit the site of the accident, or just investigate wreckage in storage facilities, the AP reported. ""That's going to vary from accident to accident,"" spokesman Christopher O'Neil said.In early January, a plane crashed into Chickamauga Lake in Tennessee, killing the pilot and his passenger. The wreckage has been in storage since then, as the family awaited answers, WCRBtv reported. ""The system is designed to respond immediately,"" former NTSB head Jim Hall said. ""This is like having a fatal accident on our interstates here and not having anyone respond to it.""In other instances, investigations did happen during the shutdown, but several days after crashes occurred. A small plane crash in Michigan that killed the 83-year-old pilot was left untouched for days until investigators arrived, CNN reported. Sheriff's deputies had to guard the crash site to ensure the wreckage wasn't disturbed."

In a letter sent to the president on Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote that the two had agreed upon the new date next week, after she had postponed her original offer of Jan. 29 amid the shutdown. ""When I wrote to you on January 23rd, I stated that we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when government has reopened to schedule this year's State of the Union address. In our conversation today, we agreed on February 5th,"" Pelosi wrote. ""Therefore, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a Joint Session of Congress on February 5, 2019 in the House Chamber. Thank you for your attention to this matter.""Trump responded with a letter of his own, accepting the new invitation. ""Thank you for your letter inviting me to deliver the State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, February 5, 2019,"" the president wrote to Pelosi. ""It is my great honor to accept. We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve! I look forward to seeing you on the 5th.""The annual address to Congress was a casualty of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which finally ended Friday. Earlier this month, Pelosi wrote to Trump rescinding her initial offer of Jan. 29, citing security concerns as both the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security officials were working without pay during the partial shutdown. Trump initially pushed back, tweeting that ""It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!"" The White House was also reportedly looking at other locations for the major speech, but then last Wednesday, Trump agreed with Pelosi that his address should wait until the government was reopened. ""[There] is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber,"" the president tweeted. ""I look forward to giving a 'great' State of the Union Address in the near future!""Trump's speech is likely to focus heavily on immigration and his continued push for a wall along the Mexican border — which was the sticking point in spending negotiations that led to the partial shutdown in the first place. But the president backed down on Friday; Trump agreed with congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks as negotiations over funding for border security and other aspects of immigration policy continue with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate. But if those talks don't produce a breakthrough or a compromise suitable to Trump, the country could be facing another partial shutdown, with funding for the agencies and departments that had been affected set to expire Feb. 15. Trump hinted as much in his speech in the Rose Garden last week, saying that if discussions don't result in funding for the wall or steel barrier he has made the hallmark of his administration, ""the government would either shut down again"" or he could declare a national emergency to build a Southern border wall.The national emergency route is something Trump has floated for weeks and is an idea sure to be challenged in court. ""I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary,"" Trump teased on Friday. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders didn't deny the possibility of another shutdown during a rare briefing on Monday with reporters. ""The president doesn't want to go through another shutdown. That's not the goal. The goal is border security and protecting the American people,"" Sanders said. ""Ideally, Democrats would take these next three weeks to negotiate in good faith, as they've indicated that they would, and come up with a deal that makes sense, that actually fixes the problem, so we don't have to go through that process."""

""Some of them may be later this week but we hope that by the end of this week all of the back pay will be made up.""The scramble to get paychecks sent out is a result of the stopgap funding measure President Trump signed on Friday ending the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.While the reopening of the government and the expectation of getting paid are welcome news for many federal workers like Towanna Thompson, a program analyst at the Department of the Interior, a lot of trepidation remains.She says even though the shutdown is over, she will be on a budget because she knows the threat of another government shutdown is just weeks away.""I think it's stupid. Why are you going to open us up for three weeks and then have us go back and do this again?""

It's located just blocks from the White House.""You know, Trump needs to wake up and smell the cappuccino,"" she says.She says she is putting off medical procedures until after Feb. 15, the day the current funding measure expires.Thompson is not alone in fearing another shuttering of the federal government.""We're still budgeting that we're not going to get a check until two weeks from now. And then a week after that we're shut down again,"" said Jared Hautamaki an attorney at the Environmental Protection Agency. During the shutdown, Hautamaki said he had been to food banks like José Andrés'. He also picked up extra shifts at Home Depot. And even though he is going back to work at the EPA Monday, he says he won't be cutting back on the extra shifts.""I plan on working as many hours as I can at Home Depot the next three weeks to prepare for the worst,"" he said.The measure to temporarily reopen the government did not include any of the $5.7 billion the president has repeatedly demanded for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. At the Rose Garden speech Friday announcing the end to the impasse, the president signaled another shutdown is an option if House and Senate negotiators don't come to an agreement he approves of.""If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15 again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States,"" Trump said.In other words, declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and have the border wall built — a move almost certain to bring about a court challenge.Eric Ingram and his wife, Andrea Jensen, are both federal workers who live in Alexandria, Va.Ingram works for the Federal Aviation Administration and took the shutdown saga in stride.""I guess it's cool to be part of history. That's nice,"" Ingram said.If he gives the impression he's laid back, it's because his wife, who works for the Department of Energy, has been on the job and — more importantly for them — has been getting paid.Jensen, though, said the shutdown has made her wonder whether it's wise for both her and her husband to work for the federal government at the same time.""It seems like there's more job security in not working for the same agency or having one person in private industry and one person in government,"" Jensen said.It's something her husband may consider down the line.But Monday is his first day back, and he's got a ton of projects to get up and running before the next possible shutdown."

His real troubles began about a year after the storm, when a crew hired by Puerto Rico's housing department showed up to make the repairs.""They weren't very professional,"" Díaz said. ""They didn't wear gloves, and they asked if I had an extra piece of wood.""Within days, there were new leaks. Not only in the living room but in the bedroom, over his daughter's crib.""None of those were there before,"" he said, pointing to a half-dozen brown splotches in the ceiling. Díaz, a music teacher and member of the town council in the hard-hit municipality of Loiza, knew that many of his neighbors were still waiting for repairs. So he began teaching himself the basics of construction.""Puerto Rico has always been in the path of hurricanes, and it always will be. So in my opinion, a good roof is a matter of life or death,"" he said. ""I want to be able to tell if the crews the government is sending to repair houses in my community are doing the work right.""Díaz is not alone in his scrutiny as Puerto Rico's government ushers in the next phase of its reconstruction — a massive rebuilding effort funded by nearly $20 billion in grants from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Island officials will have broad discretion to spend the money as they see fit — from repairing damaged homes and building new ones, to shoring up crumbled roads and infrastructure, to launching tourism and business development projects.But the pressure to spend the money wisely and efficiently is enormous, not least because President Trump himself has reportedly tried to hold up various sources of funding for the island after accusing its elected officials of being ""inept politicians"" likely to mismanage the funds.Many Puerto Ricans have denounced those attacks as unfair stereotypes. Even so, people on the island have their own concerns about the government's plans for the money, given its poor response in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, the lack of transparency in many agencies, and the persistent perception that cronyism rules when it comes to government contracting. The island's governor, Ricardo Rosselló, seems well aware of these concerns, and said he's gone so far as to ask officials at HUD to hold his government accountable for its spending.""We have an opportunity we haven't had in two or three generations,"" Rosselló said during recent public remarks, ""and that we may never have again if we don't make the most of it.""Officials on the island see the $20 billion HUD allocation as an historic opportunity to fund public projects that the bankrupt territory could never otherwise afford. Massive budget cuts and austerity measures imposed by a federal oversight board working to dig the island out of $73 billion of debt have sliced deeply into the government's ability to provide basic services.So the HUD grants are a rare bright spot. Over the last year, the government has developed a series of broad spending plans that are in various stages of approval by the federal agency. And though disbursements were held up by the federal government shutdown, officials expect the first several hundred million dollars to begin flowing imminently.A plan ""not for the people""But on an island where damage from Hurricane Maria is still visible on nearly every city block and around every bend in Puerto Rico's many winding rural roads, some on the island are questioning whether the government is fully prepared to get the money where it needs to go. They worry that in the rush to get the money flowing, many communities may be overlooked.""This money could be the answer for many communities that within an austerity crisis would not see any money coming in,"" said Ariadna Godreau-Aubert, executive director of Ayuda Legal Puerto Rico, a nonprofit that has been urging the government to seek more public participation as it has developed its spending plans. ""But what we've seen so far is that this is a plan for developers, and not for the people.""The island's government has rushed through public comment periods and not made a meaningful public outreach effort, Godreau-Aubert said. The process for proposing projects for funding is highly technical and can require large lines of credit often accessible to developers but not to groups working in local communities. And the government has only posted contract bidding documents in English on an island where just 20 percent of residents report speaking the language well.""What happens is that when people are not part of the process, they become displaced by the process,"" Godreau-Aubert said. Officials will use a significant chunk of the first $1.5 billion that HUD has approved to relocate families whose homes are in flood-prone or other risky areas. To advocates like Godreau-Aubert and others, that sounds like tearing communities apart.Asked about these concerns, Gov. Rosselló said they were overblown.""I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart. We want this plan of reconstruction not to be the governor's plan or the mayors' plan. It needs to be the plan of all Puerto Ricans,"" Rosselló said.Public outreach is a HUD requirement, and the governor said his government has taken it seriously.""But make no mistake about it, we're moving fast, but we're moving transparently and collaboratively so we can have the best long-term reconstruction of Puerto Rico,"" the governor said.Pressing for more flexibilityStill, the calls on the governor to slow things down and engage more broadly with the island's civil society are growing. In large part that's because, like the governor, others view the avalanche of federal funds as Puerto Rico's one shot to make a meaningful dent in some of the island's most entrenched social problems, especially housing.On Thursday, researchers at The Center for a New Economy, a respected San Juan think tank, warned that while the government's spending plans for the HUD grants do a good job of identifying many of the problems facing Puerto Rico's housing stock – like informality, the lack of affordability, and widespread damage from the storm – the plans do not outline a nuanced or comprehensive path forward.""What you see is that the government has a menu of proposals, but it's not clear how they're interconnected,"" said Raúl Santiago-Bartolomei, the center's expert on federal recovery funding on the island.Starting next month, the center will launch a series of conferences aimed at bringing longtime social advocates, researchers and planners together with government officials. Deepak Lamba-Nieves, the center's research director, said doing so is necessary in part because budget cuts have gutted some of the government agencies that might otherwise be equipped to thoughtfully plan the island's reconstruction.It is a gargantuan challenge given the often competing pressures on the central government from the island's 78 mayors, private developers, and large nonprofits — all wanting their share of the federal windfall.In the northwestern municipality of Camuy, Mayor Edwin García Feliciano said that after the hurricane, he was frustrated by how long it took FEMA to fund important repairs in his community. In some cases, he is still waiting.Now that it appears money from HUD may arrive first, his staff has been working feverishly to come up with the list of projects he intends to submit to the island's central government for funding: roof repairs for hundreds of families in his city still living under blue tarps, new pumping facilities that would provide more reliable running water, and road improvements, among others.""I've been mayor for more than 16 years, and I've never had this kind of opportunity to improve Camuy,"" García said. He and other mayors, including Carmen Yulín Cruz, of San Juan, are also arguing for greater flexibility in how they spend HUD funds in their own communities, arguing that'll make the recovery more nimble.But García said the central government may do a city-by-city assessment before deciding whether to grant such flexibility. In some towns, he said, there are concerns about fiscal health, staffing levels, and corruption.""Unlike some mayors, I have never been investigated for misuse of public funds,"" García said, ""so I see no reason why I shouldn't have that flexibility.""While mayors are likely to be the principal conduit for federal money into communities, they aren't the only ones drawing up their lists of projects.When Porfidio Román learned close to a year ago that the island's housing department was hosting a public hearing to take suggestions on how it should spend the billions in federal grants, he drew up his own list.Román served on the Camuy city council more than a decade ago, and is now a private citizen. He still walks the neighborhoods frequently and knows many of Camuy's problems, down to the spots where the sidewalk ends. He has politicking in his blood, and said he has designs on running for mayor when García retires.On a recent morning, Román drove his bright orange pickup truck along Camuy's winding mountain roads and pointed to several of the projects he'd included on the list he submitted at the public hearing. There was the stretch of road where he said a few more utility posts would connect an adjacent neighborhood to a more reliable section of the electric grid than the one that currently powers it. There was a long-abandoned water filtration plant that, if reopened, he said, could provide more consistent running water to two nearby barrios.Then he stopped at a small sports arena. Hurricane Maria had smashed in the roof, and more than a year later, it was still a mangle of metal.""This barrio was left without any place for recreation,"" Román said, ""and some families with children in sports have even moved away because of that. More than a year later we're still waiting for the money to fix it.""Román has no idea whether any of the billions in federal grants will find their way to the projects he's proposed. What he knows, he said, is that the answer will say a lot about how serious Puerto Rico's politicians are about ensuring the money for the island's reconstruction gets to the places that need it most."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/26/688927771/7-takeaways-from-the-longest-shutdown-in-u-s-history","The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is finally over.The government is back open — at least until Feb. 15 — after President Trump announced Friday that he would be in favor of opening and funding it for three weeks while he and congressional negotiators try to work out a broader deal on immigration and border security. Congress then quickly acted to reopen the government Friday evening.There are no two ways about it — Trump caved.  He blinked Wednesday night when he agreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would not deliver the State of the Union address next week from the House chamber until the shutdown ends. Then, early Friday afternoon, after a day dominated by the news that his former political adviser Roger Stone was indicted as part of the Mueller Russia probe, Trump completely gave in.Why? The shutdown was taking a political toll on the president, and Democrats showed no signs of budging on negotiating over border wall funding while the government was shut down.So what did we learn from this standoff and what happens now? Here are seven takeaways:1. Nancy Pelosi outmaneuvered Trump, and now she's strengthenedIt might be hard to remember, but there was a time — about a month and a half ago — when Nancy Pelosi was no sure bet to rise to speaker again. She had a restive group of Democratic freshmen, who wanted a younger generation of leaders to emerge for the party.Now, for most Democrats, there's probably no one else they could imagine in that role right now. Trump has seemed flummoxed on how to deal with Pelosi (or as he calls her, ""Nancy"") since the Dec. 11 meeting in the Oval Office — 10 days before the shutdown began — with Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. Pelosi was determined to make Trump understand that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and now with this win, Trump, ironically, helped sew up Pelosi's place as a strong speaker.Call it growing pains for Trump, but he is having a difficult time adjusting to the new power dynamic in Washington, a consequence of Democrats taking back the House after the 2018 elections.2. Trump has put himself in a boxBefore the shutdown, the president was all set to sign off on a short-term deal to keep the government open, but it wouldn't have included funding for a wall. And then came the backlash from some corners of conservative media.On Friday, there was again an outcry. Right-wing website Gateway Pundit's headline after Trump's speech: ""TRUMP CAVES! Ends Shutdown with NO BORDER WALL....""Commentator Ann Coulter called him ""the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States.""The president responded to the outcry in a tweet: ""This was in no way a concession."" It's highly unlikely that the base abandons Trump. Prior predictions of that have failed. And many callers Friday into conservative talk radio shows seemed to have the president's back. But Trump has done little to reach beyond his base in the two years since he has become president. He has alienated large portions of the country and has seen massive declines with the middle. His base might return, but his political skills are about to be tested, because he likely needs to mitigate some of the damage he's done with independents. And that's a box he built for himself.3. Shutting down the government is more of a third rail for Trump than not building a wallTrump has been badly damaged during this partial shutdown — majorities have mostly blamed him instead of Democrats; his approval ratings have slipped, even with his base; and large numbers of people said shutting down the government for wall funding is not a good idea or strategy.There's a pause now, and there are three weeks to figure out a long-term solution, but will the president now be more cautious about shutting down the government? There's a reason there wasn't a shutdown for almost 20 years after the 1995-1996 shutdown, which is now the second-longest shutdown in history.4. Is Trump laying the groundwork for a bold move?To that point, if there's no agreement in the next three weeks, will the president pull the trigger and invoke a ""national emergency"" to fund a wall?He noted that he could do so, during his speech Friday from the Rose Garden at the White House.""I have a very powerful alternative,"" Trump said, ""but I didn't want to use it at this time.""He added, ""I think we have a chance, yeah. I think we have a good chance [to get a deal]. We'll work with the Democrats and negotiate, and if we can't do that, then we'll do a — obviously we'll do the emergency because that's what it is, it's a national emergency.""That could come with its own political consequences, and it might not hold up in court – another loss the president would like to avoid.5. Do Democrats give at least some on a wall now that they got the government back open?Democrats had been prepared to offer a big pot of money that could be as much as $5.7 billion or more for border security as part of funding for the Department of Homeland Security. That could have included money for new fencing or fixes, and Schumer indicated Friday that there are plenty of measures Democrats can support — drug screening, ports of entry security, humanitarian needs.But what is a wall, and how it can get built, is very much open to debate and interpretation. Pelosi was asked about wall money Friday after Trump's announcement, and she said: ""Have I not been clear on a wall? Ok. No, I've been very clear on the wall.""She has, so far, said no to anything more than $1 for a ""wall."" But can Democrats sustain saying ""no"" indefinitely? Polling, so far, has been very much on Democrats' side during the shutdown, but there was at least one number that should give them pause. CBS found that 52 percent believe Democrats should accept a budget that includes money for a wall.6. Americans' eyes may have been opened some to just what government doesDuring this shutdown, the costs and consequences of a shutdown have become clear. Federal employees and contractors across the country who weren't getting paid were directly affected. And there have been further ripples for the economy – think landlords and small businesses serving those workers worried about their own bills.Americans are generally disconnected from government, but large majorities said the shutdown – with trash piling over at national parks and closed D.C. museums — was ""embarrassing.""7. Expect lines of attack from 2020 DemocratsTrump also gave 2020 Democrats openings — on competence and empathy. Trump's vacillations on the negotiations show him to be hardly The Art of the Deal protagonist he bills himself as.Trump Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' comments that he didn't understand why some federal workers were going to food pantries and not taking out loans also handed Democrats a gift.""It's really hard for some in the administration to understand how people live paycheck to paycheck and how marginal some of their existences are,"" Pelosi said Friday after Trump spoke.Expect Democrats eyeing the White House in 2020 to pick that up in similar ways on the campaign trail, painting the Trump administration as one of out-of-touch multimillionaires and billionaires (a central theme of Elizabeth Warren's early campaign messages). That's an image Republicans have had trouble shedding in past presidential years, and Ross' comments won't help."

I mean, just take your ego out of it,"" Carson said.When asked for clarification, a HUD spokesperson said Carson is referring to Congressional leaders, which would include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.""They need to send the President an acceptable bill so that important government functions can continue,"" the spokesperson said in a written statement to NPR.Carson's statements come as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross downplayed the hardships caused by a partial government shutdown and said he was puzzled by reports of federal workers turning to food banks and other relief. He suggested, instead, that workers take out loans to tide them over.""True, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest,"" said Ross. ""But the idea that it's 'paycheck or zero' is not a really valid idea.""The partial federal shutdown, now into its 34th day, stems from President Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to expand the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and a tightening of immigration laws.Democrats have insisted the president reopen the government first, and pay the 800,000 furloughed federal workers who are set to miss their second paycheck Friday, before negotiating a broader immigration deal.Carson said even with back pay, many federal workers won't be made ""whole.""""These federal workers, I mean, yes I know we're going to give them back pay, but that doesn't take care of the interest if they borrow money,"" Carson said.He said the longer the shutdown goes, the harder it's going to be on federal employees.""We really need to think about them, as opposed to some political victory. And it does worry me about the future of our country. If we're going to do everything based on ideology and hatred, I just don't see how we are going to be successful as a country,"" said Carson.Approximately 95 percent of HUD employees have been furloughed. Those who have been called back to work without pay are ""working around the clock"" to make sure Americans who rely on HUD for housing assistance don't get evicted, according to Carson.Carson's comments came at the annual Point-In-Time headcount survey in Washington, D.C. this week. It's a snapshot of the number of people experiencing homelessness on a given night and is typically conducted by jurisdictions in January that receive funding from HUD to combat homelessness.In the Senate Thursday, as expected, two competing measures failed that would have ended the standoff over border wall funding and reopened the government."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/01/24/688168774/trump-seeks-action-to-stop-surprise-medical-bills","President Trump instructed administration officials Wednesday to investigate how to prevent surprise medical bills, broadening his focus on drug prices to include other issues of price transparency in health care.Flanked by patients and other guests invited to the White House to share their stories of unexpected and outrageous bills, Trump directed his health secretary, Alex Azar, and labor secretary, Alex Acosta, to work on a solution, several attendees said.""The pricing is hurting patients, and we've stopped a lot of it, but we're going to stop all of it,"" Trump said during a roundtable discussion when reporters were briefly allowed into the otherwise closed-door meeting.David Silverstein, the founder of a Colorado-based nonprofit called Broken Healthcare who attended, said Trump struck an aggressive tone, calling for a solution with ""the biggest teeth you can find.""""Reading the tea leaves, I think there's big change coming,"" Silverstein said.Surprise billing, or the practice of charging patients for care that is more expensive than anticipated or isn't covered by their insurance, has received a flood of attention in the past year, particularly as Kaiser Health News, NPR, Vox and other news organizations have undertaken investigations into patients' most outrageous medical bills.Attendees said the 10 invited guests — patients as well as doctors — were given an opportunity to tell their story, though Trump didn't stay to hear all of them during the roughly hourlong gathering.The group included Paul Davis, a retired doctor from Findlay, Ohio, whose daughter's experience with a $17,850 bill for a urine test after back surgery was detailed in February 2018 in KHN-NPR's first Bill of the Month feature.Davis' daughter, Elizabeth Moreno, was a college student in Texas when she had spinal surgery to remedy debilitating back pain. After the surgery, she was asked to provide a urine sample and later received a bill from an out-of-network lab in Houston that tested it. Such tests rarely cost more than $200, a fraction of what the lab charged Moreno and her insurance company. But fearing damage to his daughter's credit, Davis paid the lab $5,000 and filed a complaint with the Texas attorney general's office, alleging ""price gouging of staggering proportions.""Davis said White House officials made it clear that price transparency is a ""high priority"" for Trump, and while they didn't see eye to eye on every subject, he said he was struck by the administration's sincerity.""These people seemed earnest in wanting to do something constructive to fix this,"" Davis said.Dr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and health policy at Johns Hopkins University who has written about transparency in health care and attended the meeting, said it was a good opportunity for the White House to hear firsthand about a serious and widespread issue.""This is how most of America lives, and [Americans are] getting hammered,"" he said.Trump has often railed against high prescription drug prices but has said less about other problems with the nation's health care system. In October, shortly before the midterm elections, he unveiled a proposal to tie the price Medicare pays for some drugs to the prices paid for the same drugs overseas, for example.Trump, Azar and Acosta said efforts to control costs in health care were yielding positive results, discussing in particular the expansion of association health plans and the new requirement that hospitals post their list prices online. The president also took credit for the recent increase in generic drug approvals, which he said would help lower drug prices.Discussing the partial government shutdown, Trump said Americans ""want to see what we're doing, like today we lowered prescription drug prices, first time in 50 years,"" according to a White House pool report.Trump appeared to be referring to a recent claim by the White House Council of Economic Advisers that prescription drug prices fell last year.However, as STAT pointed out in a recent fact check, the report from which that claim was gleaned said ""growth in relative drug prices has slowed since January 2017,"" not that there was an overall decrease in prices.Annual increases in overall drug spending have leveled off as pharmaceutical companies have released fewer blockbuster drugs, patents have expired on brand-name drugs and the waning effect of a spike driven by the release of astronomically expensive drugs to treat hepatitis C. Drugmakers were also wary of increasing their prices in the midst of growing political pressure, though the pace of increases has risen recently.Since Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives this month, party leaders have rushed to announce investigations and schedule hearings dealing with health care, focusing in particular on drug costs and protections for those with preexisting conditions.Last week, the House Oversight Committee announced a ""sweeping"" investigation into drug prices, pointing to an AARP report saying the vast majority of brand-name drugs had more than doubled in price between 2005 and 2017.Kaiser Health News correspondents Shefali Luthra and Jay Hancock contributed to this report.

Marzieh Hashemi, a news anchor for Iran's English-language Press TV, had been held in jail to make sure she would appear to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. And on Wednesday, the 59-year-old fulfilled her obligation as a material witness and was released from any further obligation, Abed Ayoud, a lawyer for the ADC told NPR.""She is relieved that this is over but the family is pretty angry and upset at the way that this happened,"" Ayoud said. Hashemi holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and Iran. She was born Melanie Franklin in Louisiana, and moved to the Mideast and changed her name after marrying an Iranian man and converting to Islam.  Since then she has become a prominent reporter in that country. She was taken into custody at the St. Louis airport on Jan. 13, then transported by the FBI to Washington. Her detainment was initially reported by Iranian news outlets, but the FBI and other law enforcement agencies declined to confirm the reports for several days. Ayoud said all three of Hashemi's adult children have been subpoenaed to testify in the same case. Officials haven't said what the grand jury is investigating. Hashemi and her children haven't been charged with any crimes. Catherine Shakdam, a spokeswoman for the Journalist Support Committee, told NPR Hashemi is with her family at a hotel in Washington, D.C. Shakdam said Hashemi was afraid the government shutdown would prolong her detainment. ""In light of the shutdown, it was quite quick and she is quite relieved,"" Shakdam said. She also suggests publicity about the government's use of rarely used material witness laws put pressure on officials to release Hashemi as quickly possible. As NPR reported, ""Federal law allows for the detention of a person who is ""material in a criminal proceeding"" if it seems that person is unlikely to respond to a subpoena."" Several organizations in the U.S. and abroad, as well as Iranian government officials, called for Hashemi's immediate release. "

Should its young women register for the draft? A federal panel says it is working on answers to those questions — and is considering how the nation could implement a universal service program and whether it should be mandatory or optional.""In a country of more than 329 million people, the extraordinary potential for service is largely untapped,"" said Joe Heck, chairman of the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service. On Wednesday, he and his fellow commissioners unveiled the panel's interim report to Congress. An overarching goal of the commission, Heck said, is to ""create a universal expectation of service"" in which every American is ""inspired and eager to serve.""The challenge to realizing that potential, Heck and other commissioners said during an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., is how to increase awareness and access to opportunities to provide public service — and to make those options more attractive. With a nod toward the partial government shutdown, Heck also acknowledged that ""the irony of releasing a report that speaks in part to encouraging more people to seek a career in public service during the midst of a shutdown is not lost on us.""An untapped generationOf America's younger generations, Heck said, ""Generation Z represents a huge potential for this country if we can find ways to encourage a greater number of them to serve.""The commission's report also credits millennials with wanting to step up and help others.""Young Americans' interest in service is evident,"" the report states, ""given their appetite to volunteer: Over 28 percent of millennials report volunteering in 2017, performing roughly 1.5 billion hours of community service.""Heck also cited the 48 million people age 65 and over, who represent about 15 percent of the U.S. population, as a ""growing source of untapped potential.""""Today's seniors aren't retiring in the same way that their ancestors did, and they have a strong desire to stay engaged and give back to their communities.""The commission is due to submit its final report — including recommendations on whether women should be required to register with Selective Service (the military draft) and how the agency should adapt to the modern age — in March 2020. Between now and then, the panel will hold public hearings on ideas of how to meet America's service needs. The first such hearing is slated for Feb. 21 in Washington, D.C.The possibilities under consideration range from boosting the stipend volunteers receive during service to awarding college credit for national service work. Another potential plan would create a Public Service Corps program, similar to the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, which could offer scholarships and special training to ""students at colleges throughout the nation in exchange for a commitment to work in civil service.""And the commission noted an option to ""retain programs to forgive student loans for Americans who work in public service careers for at least a decade.""The panel also is considering a component for students still in high school.The report listed a number of ways to improve Americans' civic education, from adopting national standards for civic knowledge to giving educators and schools free access to the same citizenship and civic resources used by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and other agencies.Noting the interim report was timed to come out just after the national day of service that many people perform to honor the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Heck quoted King's statement that ""Life's most persistent and urgent question is, what are you doing for others?""Women and the draftThe national service commission was formed in response to a string of sea changes in the military, from removing barriers to women to the shifting demands of modern warfare. It is charged with answering elemental questions about the Selective Service such as whether women should be allowed and required to register and whether the draft itself is still needed.The question of whether women should register for the draft, Heck said, provokes ""visceral"" responses. On one side is the idea that women should be able to register as a matter of equality. But on the other, he said, is the view that women hold a special role in American society.As for what the review panel's answer will be, Heck said Wednesday, ""I can't tell you, because the commission hasn't come to a decision.""After traveling around the country to hear from members of the public, the commission wrote, ""We heard from people who believe strongly that the United States should pursue a transformative effort to involve many more Americans in military, national, and public service.""One option, those commenters said, would be to create a universal obligation, with the suggestion that ""all Americans be required to serve, with a choice in how to satisfy the requirement.""But other members of the public asked how such requirements would be implemented — and whether they would be legal under the Constitution.The interim report is coming out more than three years after the Defense Department lifted gender-based restrictions on military service. If women are eventually included or allowed to participate in registering for the draft, it would reflect another step toward equality in the U.S. military. Other recent high-profile steps include the announcement in January 2013 that female service members would no longer be excluded from direct ground combat roles. Adding women to the draft would reflect a deep cultural shift from the years in which fighting wars was seen solely as men's work. But in terms of the logistical challenge of adding women into the mix, the Selective Service System has previously said it ""is capable of registering and drafting women with its existing infrastructure"" with only a modest amount of additional resources."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/22/687516967/the-border-wall-isnt-the-only-reason-democrats-oppose-plan-to-end-the-shutdown","Democrats and immigrant rights groups were quick to oppose President Trump's proposal to end the government shutdown over the weekend because it includes $5.7 billion for an expanded border wall.Now that they've seen the full language of the bill, they've found other reasons not to like it.The proposed bill includes some big changes to U.S. immigration policy that were not included in the president's public announcement, such as a provision that would sharply limit asylum applications for children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.""It's a Trojan horse filled with many extreme immigration proposals,"" said Kerri Talbot of the Immigration Hub, an immigrants' rights organization, during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. ""The bill includes the most extreme proposals on asylum I think that I've ever seen,"" Talbot said.When he announced his proposal on Saturday, Trump said it includes ""critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse,"" including a new system that would allow Central America minors to apply for asylum in their home countries.But the president did not mention that the proposal would in fact require migrant children to apply from their home countries and prevent them from applying in person at the border. In addition, only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be permitted to apply for asylum — a sharp break from current policy.""This historic change in asylum law would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" said Greg Chen, government relations director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.When Trump announced the proposal over the weekend, he said the bill would provide ""three years of legislative relief"" for recipients of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA protects about 700,000 young immigrants, including DREAMERs, who were brought to the country illegally as children, from deportation. He also said the bill would extend protections for 300,000 holders of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.Protections offered to immigrants under both DACA and TPS have been targeted to end under the Trump administration, though federal courts have stepped in to extend both programs for now.But on closer inspection, immigration experts say, the Senate GOP bill would likely cover fewer immigrants than are currently protected under DACA and TPS.The administration's proposal would tighten DACA requirements in a number of ways and raise fees for the program. The proposal ""does not extend DACA,"" wrote David Bier, an immigration analyst at the Cato Institute, so much as replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""Likewise, the bill would create a new application process for TPS holders, advocates say, with new standards and higher fees that would exclude many current TPS holders. And while the bill would allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Haiti to apply, it would exclude those from countries such as Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.On the Senate floor Tuesday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended the proposal as a ""bold, comprehensive"" compromise to reopen the federal government. McConnell criticized Democrats for rejecting the proposal and promised a vote in the Senate later this week.But Democrats say there's nothing bipartisan about the bill, which was negotiated without their input.""The president's proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith,"" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer during remarks on the Senate floor.""The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one,"" Schumer said."

Republicans are planning a vote on President Trump's proposal to end the stalemate. But Democrats are reiterating that his offer — with $5.7 billion for a border wall in exchange for temporary protections for those under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and temporary protected status programs — is a nonstarter, meaning there's no realistic end yet in sight for the shutdown. It's doubtful Trump's plan could reach the 60 votes it needs in the Senate, and if it did, the bill would likely be dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also agreed to vote Thursday on a spending package that reopens the government through Feb. 8 without additional money the administration wants for Trump's wall, but with some added disaster relief money. That measure is all but certain to fail in the GOP-controlled Senate. McConnell hailed Trump's plan on Tuesday as a bipartisan deal that Democrats should accept, saying that ""the opportunity to end all of this is staring us right in the face.""""This is the only proposal that can be signed by the president and immediately reopen the government,"" McConnell said. Trump unveiled his offer on Saturday — $5.7 billion for the wall along the Mexican border he has demanded, in return for three-year protections for some 700,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children and roughly 300,000 immigrants fleeing political unrest. It also includes disaster funding and would fully fund the shuttered government agencies through this fiscal year. Schumer made clear Trump's offer wasn't palatable, saying on the Senate floor Tuesday that it was ""one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.""The top Senate Democrat also compared Trump's offer to ""hostage-taking"" instead of a compromise, given that it was the president who rolled back protections for both DACA and TPS. He also pointed out that the provisions Trump outlined for the DACA program are narrower than the bipartisan Senate proposal the White House said was the basis for that part of the bill, and he called new provisions regarding rules governing the process to apply for asylum ""a poison pill.""""Now offering some temporary protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise — it's a hostage situation,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR's Morning Edition that Democrats are largely united behind reopening the government and then proceeding with negotiations on border security. ""We want to discredit the use of government shutdown as a negotiating tactic,"" Kaine said. ""If we give in to that kind of a tactic, using massive swaths of the American government, federal workers and American citizens as leverage, you can be sure this president will turn to that again and again and again every time he doesn't get his way.""About 800,000 government workers employed by the departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Transportation are affected by the partial government shutdown, either being furloughed completely or working without pay.Those workers have already missed one paycheck and are slated to miss another this week. Many employees live paycheck to paycheck, and the financial strain is great — and also starting to have growing real-world implications for nongovernment workers. For example, 10 percent of Transportation Security Administration workers called in sick over the weekend, saying they couldn't report to work because of financial limitations. And the FBI Agents Association released a 72-page report detailing how not just agents and their families had been harmed by the shutdown but how national security has been jeopardized too, citing anonymous quotes from dozens of agents across the country.  ""The shutdown has eliminated any ability to operate. ... It's bad enough to work without pay, but we can only conduct administrative functions while doing it. The fear is our enemies know they can run freely,"" said one agent described as someone who is working in ""both overt and undercover counter-intelligence matters against a top threat to national security."" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow argued to reporters that there would be an ""immediate snapback"" in the U.S. economy after the government reopens, but that administration officials also understand the pain that many federal workers are experiencing. ""I don't want to belittle it. No one likes the hardship that people are having to shoulder, I understand that, including myself,"" said Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. ""I have young people on my staff  who are concerned, so I get that.""NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell and NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley contributed to this report. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/22/687433596/white-house-moves-forward-with-state-of-the-union-plans","After a week of tit for tat with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, amid a monthlong government shutdown, the White House is now moving ahead with plans for the president's State of the Union address, proceeding as if it were happening as originally planned next week. White House officials are aiming for the speech to occur before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Jan. 29. But it is far from guaranteed. The House must pass a resolution to call a joint session with the Senate before the president can come speak. It's unclear whether that will happen; Pelosi hasn't yet weighed in on whether she will allow it. White House and House Democratic aides confirm to NPR that the White House requested a security walk-through of the U.S. Capitol on Monday. That was declined because of the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.The original security check was canceled last week after Pelosi sent a letter to Trump suggesting that he reschedule his State of the Union address, or submit it in writing because of security concerns resulting from the government shutdown. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen pushed back on the security concerns, saying in a tweet last week that even if they weren't getting paid, the U.S. Secret Service and others in the Department of Homeland Security ""are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union.""While there has been no official communication between the White House and the speaker's office since last week, President Trump did tweet a response to Pelosi over the weekend, criticizing her for walking back the invitation and leaving the outcome uncertain. ""I'll get back to you soon!"" the president wrote. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/22/687429903/colleges-provide-tuition-relief-to-furloughed-workers","Reanna Robinson's life this spring is pretty hectic. She works full-time as a TSA officer at Reagan National Airport, she's raising her 1-year-old daughter, and she's taking five college classes on her way to a degree in criminal justice.On top of all that, she's dealing with more financial pressure than usual. That's because, as an essential worker during a government shutdown that has stretched to 31 days, she's still reporting for work but not getting a paycheck. ""It's very stressful,"" she says. ""It kind of takes a mental toll on you.""Initially, she planned to pay for spring classes at the College of Southern Maryland out of pocket, assuming that the shutdown would end by the time tuition was due in mid-January.  But the shutdown hadn't ended when she logged on to register for spring classes and pay her first tuition bill.""I was like, I really can't afford it,"" she says. She considered dropping some classes to save money.But an announcement on the school's website caught her eye. Turns out, administrators at the College of Southern Maryland anticipated that many of their students were in Robinson's position. In early January, the school enacted a temporary policy that alleviates the financial strain on furloughed students and students who are dependents of furloughed workers. The original tuition payment deadline, January 9th, was deferred until later this spring, according to Karen Smith-Hupp, the college's spokesperson. This option, she says, is popular with students who expect back pay once the shutdown ends but for now ""are looking to push that payment for spring semester out as far as they can."" Students who do not anticipate back pay can apply for a one-time emergency grant, paid for by the college's fundraising foundation, on a first-come, first-serve basis. Maryland is home to more than 42,000 federal workers who are going without pay due to the shutdown. The College of Southern Maryland isn't sure how many students are impacted, but said around a hundred people have taken advantage of the policy. Other colleges in Maryland have also stepped up to help students who are furloughed or dependents of furloughed workers. In Largo, Md., for example, Prince George's Community College announced it would provide tuition assistance for impacted students. And at Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Md., the school pushed its spring payment deadline back and says it will handle further student concerns on a case-by-case basis. Being a furloughed worker and going without pay can be really challenging, says Tara Carew, who heads the  financial aid department at Anne Arundel. ""But when you're also trying to make [tuition] payments, it ... seems to hurt twice as hard.""It's unclear when the government shutdown will end – all eyes are on Congress and the White House. Democrats and Republicans are slowly getting to a resolution, and a vote on the most recent proposal by the president is expected this week.  Last week, President Trump signed a bill that ensured back pay for all furloughed workers once the shutdown ends. That bill doesn't include federal contractors, though some senators are working on legislation to fix that.At Southern Maryland, Robinson chose to have her tuition deadline deferred. Late spring, she says, gives her ""more than enough time"" to get her finances in order, although she still has worries. She's taken on a side job retrieving scooters for local scooter operators.""School is my first priority,"" she says, ""[but] I still need to work to provide for my daughter and myself."" Classes started this week, and Robinson says they're good so far. ""Books are expensive, as usual,"" she says, but she's determined to finish school. "

The deal allows the park to avoid the awkward possibility that it would be closed on the federal holiday honoring King.""Without the assistance provided by The Delta Air Lines Foundation, it would have remained closed during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend,"" a National Park Service spokesman told NPR.The reopening comes as the civil rights leader's family and fans celebrate what would have been King's 90th birthday. And because of the grant, those celebrations and remembrances can now include visits to the home where King was born and his longtime church. The 35-acre park, which draws more than 670,000 visitors to Atlanta's Sweet Auburn neighborhood each year, reopened Saturday. With an $83,500 grant from Delta and money from National Park Service recreation fees, it now has enough funds to operate until Feb. 3.Feb. 3 is also when Atlanta hosts the Super Bowl, and the King park could receive thousands of visitors in town for the game and related events around Mercedes-Benz Stadium, less than 3 miles away.""We are looking forward to your visit,"" the park's website states, announcing the temporary reopening. The park's main building sits across the street from The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, where King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, are buried. Down the street is the two-story clapboard house where King was born. In the other direction is Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was baptized and served as a pastor.The carrier that became Delta was founded in Georgia and has long had its headquarters in Atlanta. The company's CEO, Ed Bastian, said the airline ""felt it was important we do our part to ensure that the historical landmarks be accessible to the public.""The special grant will help cover the costs of reopening and cleaning up the King park, the National Park Service says. The money will also be used to pay maintenance costs and for employees who wouldn't be paid under the NPS's fee collection fund.The arrangement in Atlanta is one of the most high-profile cases of a third party stepping in to open a national park to visitors while Washington is wracked by the partial federal shutdown. There are currently more than 40 similar funding deals in place, as the NPS tried to cope with a gap in operating nearly 420 national parks.The contributions are coming from businesses, groups and states. New York is paying to operate the Statue of Liberty National Monument, for instance, and Utah's tourism office is paying to keep visitor services running at the Arches, Bryce Canyon, and Zion national parks. And in Yellowstone National Park, snowy roads are being groomed thanks to money from Xanterra Parks & Resorts.NPR's Ian Stewart contributed to this report."

When she got to the checkstand she paid for some of her groceries with money from the USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP—which is issuing its February payments early. Rubich is one of about 39 million people who are now spending their SNAP payments not knowing when the next one will come due to the federal government shutdown.When she first heard SNAP benefits were coming two weeks early and would have to last until at least the end of next month, Rubich thought, ""no they can't be doing that.""Then she got a text about it.""And sure enough, checked my balance on the app and was like, 'Oh my god.

The Pentagon identified Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Fla.; Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, of upstate New York, and Scott A. Wirtz of St. Louis, a civilian operations support specialist working for the Defense Intelligence Agency, as victims of the bombing. A defense contractor, Valiant Integrated Services, identified Ghadir Taher, 27, of East Point, Ga., as the fourth American victim. She was reportedly a Syrian-born Arabic interpreter.Photos from the ceremony showed Trump and Pompeo looking on as Wirtz's flag-draped casket was carried from a military cargo plane to a waiting van.Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the bombing. This is Trump's second visit to the Delaware Air Force base to witness a dignified transfer, as the return of remains is known. In February 2017, he paid his respects to Navy SEAL William ""Ryan"" Owens, who was killed during a U.S. raid in Yemen. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for this week's bombing — Saturday's ceremony came exactly one month after the president declared victory over the group.""We have won against ISIS. We have beaten them and we've beaten them badly,""  Trump said in a video on Dec. 19. ""Our boys, our young women, our men – they're all coming back and they're coming back now."" As he left the White House for Dover on Saturday morning, he told reporters that the U.S. has been ""hitting ISIS very hard over the last three weeks."" Earlier this week, a Pentagon spokesman said ISIS ""remains a threat."" As NPR's Greg Myre and Laurel Wamsley reported: Hundreds of thousands of civilians have died in Syria since the beginning of the conflict in 2011. NPR's Daniella Cheslow noted earlier this week that Manbij, a bustling city of 100,000 people, has faced ongoing attacks from the Islamic State and that ""the U.S. has been training local forces to take over patrolling duties — a handover that has been thrust into uncertainty by Trump's December announcement the U.S. will withdraw.""Trump announced the trip to Dover Air Force Base early Saturday morning on Twitter. It was followed by a number of other messages criticizing the news media and Mexico, and warning of an economic decline if he is impeached. Later on Saturday, the president made what he billed a ""major announcement"" regarding border security and the ongoing partial government shutdown – the longest in American history. The announcement included an offer to extend protections for some immigrants brought to the country illegally as children in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686396367/our-state-of-disunion-trump-pelosi-spar-over-big-speech-but-why-do-we-care","Updated Jan. 24 at 10 p.m. ETIt was nearly midnight Wednesday when President Trump sent the tweet saying he would wait to deliver his ""great"" State of the Union speech until after the government is fully reopened.That came as a relief to those who had taken seriously his threat to come to the Capitol on Jan. 29 as originally planned, with or without the blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. No sooner had Trump threatened to come ahead than Pelosi made clear just how unwelcome he would be, until the partial government shutdown was over.Some had visions of Trump and a squad of Secret Service agents barging their way in, no doubt to the cheers of Republican members of Congress.  None of that was ever likely to happen. But the vision of it was dark, indeed. The fact is that the speaker can withhold House consent to the joint congressional resolution by which the president is empowered to speak. So barging in would be a breach of more than protocol.  Hours later, in that late-night tweet, the president backed down. Tensions eased. Some read that as a sign the stalled negotiations over homeland security (read: the president's desire for $5 billion in funding to build a wall or barrier on the border with Mexico) might be revived. By the end of Thursday, the Senate leaders of the two parties were talking to each other again.But that was after test votes on the two parties' dueling proposals to reopen the government had failed on the Senate floor earlier in the day. The Democrats' plan attracted six Republican votes but still fell eight votes shy of the three-fifths majority required to advance the bill. The GOP alternative, based on the proposal Trump offered over the weekend, fell 10 votes shy and had the support of a single Democratic senator.By Thursday evening, the White House was reported to be preparing language for a declaration of a national emergency, a tactic that had been mentioned before but that Trump has so far chosen not to pursue. It's hard to find anything good to say about a government shutdown — especially the longest one in U.S. history. But at least we all know more now about something we all took for granted: the president's annual State of the Union speech to Congress in the Capitol. Far more Americans now know that the State of the Union address, or ""SOTU"" as some call it, does not need to be a speech, does not need to be delivered in person, does not need to be annual and does not need to happen in the Capitol.The only thing required by the Constitution (Article II, Section 3) is that the president ""shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.""That's it. Rather vague, as are many parts of the Constitution, which was, after all, a series of compromises among negotiators who were suspicious of each other and suspicious of government in general.Much of what we assume about this giving of ""Information"" has been established by custom. President George Washington decided a report each year made sense, and he also gave the first SOTU to Congress in person in 1790 in Federal Hall in New York City, the seat of the fledgling U.S. government at the time. Washington's in-person delivery was continued by his successor, John Adams. But in 1801, the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, decided the in-person speech was not for him. Jefferson disliked the similarities between this address and the manner in which the king of England in those days addressed opening sessions of Parliament to deliver his marching orders. (Some say Jefferson also disliked his own public speaking voice.)In any event, the custom of a written speech took hold and prevailed for more than a century. It was not until Woodrow Wilson arrived in 1913 that the notion of in-person delivery was revived.Wilson was a progressive Democrat and Princeton professor who apparently liked the idea of getting up to lecture in front of Congress. It was his improvement on the example of Theodore Roosevelt, who several years earlier had begun making the annual address a muscular agenda — rather than just a rundown on what was happening around the government. So, just maybe, a delay makes sense now with the government partially shut down. (We had one in 1986 after the space shuttle Challenger blew up.)Or, just maybe, having this annual shindig ""just the way we have always have had it"" does not make sense anymore.There is a growing sense in America that old ways of doing things do not always make sense anymore. That applies to the way we go shopping or go to the movies or go to school, all of which we can do now without going anywhere. So what about this thing, the SOTU? Is it something everyone really has to physically attend, or is there an adaptation available? Could this annual monster meetup near the National Mall just, well, go away?Would we miss the hour-plus of speechifying and unspontaneous ovations from one side of the aisle or the other? Would we be the poorer without those hours of pregame and postgame punditry? To be sure, something would be lost if the one truly bipartisan, bicameral, multibranch and multi-everything confab of the year disappears from the nation's capital.But, for roughly half of our history, this ritual did not require anyone to go anywhere. For more than 100 years, it was understood that a president's annual report to Congress would be a written document sent up to the Capitol. That's how things were from the time of Jefferson in the beginning of the 19th century until Wilson's arrival early in the 20th century.Due to ill health, Wilson went back to mailing it in for the last two years he was president. Warren Harding did two SOTU addresses in person before dying in office. Calvin Coolidge gave his first in 1923 in person and allowed it to be broadcast on the radio. Then Coolidge went back to the written report, which Herbert Hoover also favored.But starting with Franklin Roosevelt, the full value of the SOTU was appreciated and expanded upon. FDR used it to proclaim his ""four freedoms,"" LBJ to announce his war on poverty and Richard Nixon to say ""one year of Watergate is enough.""In the 1930s, the radio microphone became a fixture, followed by one for TV in 1947. And the presumption took hold that the president was addressing not only Congress but an entire nation — listening and watching on an ever-expanding array of electronic devices.The SOTU itself has become a kind of electronic device and one of the most powerful a president has.Over the years, there must have been times when Capitol Hill leaders wished they could lift that powerful device deftly from the hands of the president and put it on a shelf. But even those speakers of the House most at loggerheads with a president have felt they had to issue the routine invitation and sit there and take it. To do otherwise would have been unthinkable.Until now.So what will happen next? Thursday the president said basically it's up to Pelosi. ""It's really her choice,"" Trump said, ""I would have done it in a different place but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union — to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day."" The president added: ""But I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union. So what she said I thought was actually reasonable: We'll have the State of the Union when the shutdown is over.""Asked when that might be, Trump replied with ""That I can't tell you, that I can't tell you. But, we have a lot of alternatives — but we need border security.""House Republican leaders had speculated last week that another venue on the Hill (like the GOP-controlled Senate chamber) might be found anytime the president of the United States wishes to speak. And surely that's true. And this week Trump received multiple offers from GOP governors who offered up their statehouses as alternative sites.But does it make sense to do this speech at this time in any other place than the House floor? Or — as Trump seemed to concede this week in bowing to Pelosi — does a change from the traditional venue sap too much of the tradition, glory and grandeur?And as long as we are asking questions, let us return to one posed a moment ago: Does it make sense to gather all these people at once the way we do, largely to project a false sense of unity?Perhaps the best answer is another question: Would we be better off with no national show of unity at all?"
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686299832/i-m-falling-apart-shutdown-squeeze-tightens-for-low-wage-workers","Receiving a $0 pay stub is not easy on any worker. But some of the thousands of federal employees and contract workers who live paycheck to paycheck say the lingering partial government shutdown feels devastating. They started the shutdown with little or no savings and no safety net to weather this kind of financial emergency. Now, one month into the shutdown, even those who had a cushion are finding their bank accounts empty or negative and bills and loan payments piling up. They are single parents and large families, many still working long hours to keep the nation's airports and prisons secure. One mom says she is skipping meals so her kids can eat. Another says she is ""falling apart.""""I have no money,"" says T. Miller. ""I don't know how much longer I can stay on this job.""Miller is a newly minted Transportation Security Administration officer who works at a busy airport in the Washington, D.C., area. NPR isn't using his full name because the TSA doesn't allow its employees to speak publicly. He became a government employee last December and makes about $32,000.Miller makes much less than most federal workers in his region. In the areas surrounding D.C., such workers tend to have high salaries — $95,212 is the average for Virginia — and those working in lower-income jobs are spread throughout the country.In some states with high numbers of federal employees affected by the shutdown, low pay combined with higher costs of living make it even more of a challenge for those who suddenly find themselves without a paycheck.Elizabeth Kandror, a clerk with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Homer, Alaska, makes about $37,000 per year. She has been a federal employee for three years, and she says she didn't expect the shutdown to last this long. ""It's so unbelievable,"" she says. ""This is what we've come down to — the 'greatest nation' on earth?"" she asks, her voice rising.After Washington, D.C., Alaska has the highest percentage of civilian federal employees who work for agencies affected by the shutdown in a single state: 14 per 1,000 Alaska workers, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management and Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its cost of living is also among the highest in the country, according the Commerce Department's ""price parity"" index.And yet the average paycheck for federal employees there is near the middle of all states: about $77,000 a year.There is a caveat: The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't break out how much federal employees make in different agencies. So the wage data available include both workers affected and not affected by the shutdown (some agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Labor have been funded by Congress for the current fiscal year).The majority of those affected by the shutdown in Alaska work for the Interior and Transportation departments.""I did file for unemployment and got $300,"" Kandror says. That will help them get through the end of the month. The single mom says she is fortunate not to have rent payments because she lives in a cabin on her parents' land. But she, too, lives paycheck to paycheck, and if the shutdown continues beyond January, she says she will probably have to go on welfare. Kandror is the mother of a 3-year-old boy. She says she has funds to pay for day care next month, but that's about it. She had to wait nine months to get her son in day care and fears losing that spot if she can't pay.She says she will need to find other work, but it will be hard because Homer is a seasonal town and there aren't a lot of jobs in the wintertime. ""That's why I was so grateful to get this federal job — because it's year-round,"" she says.To be sure, not all areas with high concentrations of federal employees are taking home smaller paychecks. Maryland and Virginia, home to many federal workers in the D.C. suburbs, are the two states where they make the most on average: $107,536 and $95,212, respectively.In the redAbout 14 percent of federal employees make under $50,000 a year, according to government data.Amy Fellows is a 33-year-old single mom of three kids — ages 10, 3 and 1.She has been skipping meals for days now to make sure her kids have enough to eat.Fellows is a correctional officer in Arizona and works for the Federal Bureau of Prisons making $49,000 a year. She is also working with no pay because she is considered essential — sometimes clocking in a 16-hour day. ""I want to make sure my kids have that food,"" says Fellows. ""I was able to pay for my rent and my utilities, but now I have nothing in my bank.""Actually, she is already in the red — her bank account has a negative balance of $400.""I've actually had to call out three times because I can't afford day care,"" she says. Day care is $200 a week for her two youngest kids. She often feels like having to choose between staying home and taking care of her two youngest children or going to work. She is worried about losing her job. Federal employees will get back pay when the government reopens. But until then, many are part of the 40 percent of Americans who would not be able to afford an unexpected $400 expense, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute. They are completely dependent on every single bimonthly paycheck to cover the basics — rent, utilities and food.Jacinda's husband is a TSA screener in Oregon. NPR is not using her last name or her husband's name because TSA forbids personnel to speak publicly.When Jacinda first spoke to NPR last week, she was worried about how her family would survive. NPR reached out again this week, and she says she has only grown more anxious and desperate.""I'm falling apart,"" she says. ""I genuinely believed this would be over this week.""The couple has two kids — a soon-to-be 4-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The single-income family lives paycheck to paycheck — and says missing a second paycheck would be dire.""I feel so out of control,"" Jacinda says. ""It's hard to even articulate how angry and frustrated and pissed off I am that my husband is working full time and we're like terrified to lose our house."" The couple desperately needs a paycheck to pay for rent, she says, or they fear they will be evicted.""Most of our bills are not getting paid,"" Jacinda says. ""I've started to get phone calls from collectors now for the credit card bills."" She says she has explained their situation to the collectors, but they keep calling.Contractors falling behindFederal contract workers are also feeling anxious and uncertain. Unlike government employees, contractors will most likely not get back pay once the government reopens.Zachary Schindler is a federal contractor at the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center in South Dakota. He's a cook in the cafeteria — one of the hardest-hit sectors because they are typically minimum-wage employees, often with few or no benefits.""I'm falling behind,"" says Schindler. He has been on the job for about three years, and he and his wife had built a cushion toward buying a house. But their savings are now gone, he says, and they are ""just living paycheck to paycheck again.""They have car loans, rent, mobile phones, utility and food bills. ""We are struggling to see how we are going to pay our next bills,"" he says.Schindler, 29, and his wife are the parents of a 2-year-old son. They had to pull him out of day care because they could no longer afford the $400-per-month fee. Schindler says he is staying away from news, especially political news. ""It makes me angry,"" he says. ""I'm applying to anything I can,"" including jobs outside his expertise, like county appraiser. Just not the federal government.People like Schindler could feel the shutdown pain even more deeply if it drags on even further, says Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University who studies the workforce. He estimates that 4.1 million people work under federal contracts (there is no national database that tracks these workers). He says it is people who work for small companies, like cooks on contract, who may lose their jobs entirely because of the shutdown.""That's where you would expect to see some pretty significant impacts of even a two-week shutdown,"" says Light, ""because the smaller the business, the more likely it is to lay off workers at the first sign that there might be a delay in payment.""""I'm not sure how they'll recover if this shutdown continues much longer,"" he says.Plan A, B, CMany federal workers and contractors NPR spoke to expressed frustration at the Trump administration and Congress for allowing the shutdown to persist.Kandror, with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska, says she has called her two senators to express her frustration but hasn't heard back. ""I feel like my life has been hijacked,"" she says. She wants both parties to work together for a solution, she says, ""but not on our backs.""Fellows, the correctional officer in Arizona, says she feels politicians are thinking only of their own political gain. Miller, the TSA officer working in the Washington, D.C., area, is one of many federal workers now looking for a new job. He says he has already called his former boss and has applied to other jobs as well.""I have to have Plan A, B and C in motion,"" he says. Plan A is hanging on to his government job, Plan B is going back to his gym work and C is work elsewhere. He takes a long pause and a deep breath before he says, ""I can hang on to this job for about two more weeks"" and that's a stretch, he says. If the shutdown isn't resolved after that — ""it's the no-turning-back kind of phase.""""My expenses are low,"" Miller says, but he has bills to pay — like credit cards, a car loan and college loans. He has been in contact with his creditors, and though he says they are giving him an extension, he doesn't know for how long.He says he feels fortunate compared with other TSA colleagues but is still worried. ""I feel like I'm going backwards,"" he says.Miller graduated from college in 2004 and worked as a physical trainer at a local gym for seven years with no benefits and no retirement. He joined TSA ""because the government is the most stable employer.""""I had big dreams for this job,"" he says. ""I went into it planning to make it a career."" He says he planned to use his entry-level job as a steppingstone in what he envisioned as a long career.The government offers good benefits, he says, but working without pay is raising his anxiety level. It was never part of Miller's plan.Leila Fadel, Koko Nakajima and David Welna contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686466207/its-getting-harder-for-migrants-to-win-asylum-cases-lawyers-say","When the young woman from Nicaragua got off the plane in South Florida, she hadn't seen her parents since they left their tiny Central American town to find work in the U.S. more than a decade ago. ""When I saw them, I ran to hug them,"" she said through an interpreter, her eyes lighting up as she described their reunion at the airport. ""I felt a huge joy when I saw them again, and I knew that I was going to be here, protected,"" she said. We're not using the woman's name because her parents are undocumented, and she's asking for asylum and hopes to stay in the U.S. She fled Nicaragua with her infant son to get away from the boy's abusive father. Finally, in Florida, she felt like she had escaped his grasp.     ""I was far away,"" she said. ""I felt safe here."" But she may not be safe in the U.S. for long. Bad timing for an asylum caseThe young woman arrived at a moment when immigration is paralyzing American politics. The President wants to build a wall on the southern border, and keep asylum-seekers on the other side of it. Almost a month into the partial government shutdown, there's still no agreement on the wall. But another effort to stop the flow of migrants is taking hold.The number of asylum claims denied by immigration judges increased to nearly 70 percent last year, after the Justice Department made it harder for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence to get asylum.  The young woman from Nicaragua has the dubious distinction of being one of the first migrants to be denied asylum under a June 2018 ruling from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a case known as ""Matter of A-B-."" ""I feel in my heart that had this case been before 'Matter of A-B-,' we would have had a different outcome,"" said Evelyn Colón, the Nicaraguan woman's lawyer. Colón points to a stack of legal filings more than five inches high, detailing the years of sexual and physical abuse her client described to her. Had the woman's asylum hearing been held earlier — even a few weeks earlier — Colón thinks she would've had a good chance of getting asylum. But now, Colón says some immigration judges have begun denying all asylum claims based on domestic violence. ""I don't think they take the time to listen to the client, even in the hearing,"" Colón said. ""They just have their script.""In her hearing last June, the Nicaraguan woman told an immigration judge in Miami that her boyfriend got increasingly violent after she got pregnant. One day, she says, he showed up drunk and started banging on the door.""I was scared because he was screaming very loud,"" she said. ""And he was banging on the door, saying 'open it, you are my woman, you have to open.' He kicked the door so many times that the door fell."" The woman says her boyfriend raped her that night. She was seven months pregnant at the time. She believes that's why her son was born prematurely a month later.In his ruling, immigration judge Michael C. Horn wrote that he was ""very sympathetic to the plight of the individual in this case,"" and that he found her story to be credible. Still, he denied her request for asylum, citing ""Matter of A-B-"" multiple times in his decision. 'Its not easy for the judges'Former immigration judge Mark Metcalf knows how gut-wrenching these cases can be. ""It's a very difficult analysis,"" said Metcalf, who served as an immigration judge in Miami and is now a county prosecutor in Kentucky. ""It is not easy for the judges. I've been there, I know. It's not easy to say no to people.""In order to get asylum in the U.S., you have to show that you've been persecuted because of your race, religion or other characteristics. And Metcalf says just being the victim of a crime doesn't qualify. ""I've had to look a person in the eye and tell them I believe you were telling me the truth,"" Metcalf said. ""I just don't believe your claim is rewarded with asylum.""After the decision from Sessions in ""Matter of A-B-"" last year, the number of asylum denials issued by immigration judges jumped in the second half of 2018, according to the TRAC Immigration project at Syracuse University. The number of asylum cases granted was up too, but denials grew even faster. Immigration judges of now reject nearly 70 percent of asylum claims, up from less than 60 percent when President Trump took office.More judges hired, to speed the processImmigration judges are part of the Justice Department, which is trying to speed up the pace of immigration courts in the face of a massive backlog. The Trump administration has hired more immigration judges, and pushed them to decide cases faster. ""We've seen a huge increase in the number of immigration judges,"" said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge in Pennsylvania who is now a resident fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration. In fiscal 2018, the administration hired 81 new immigration judges — more than 20 percent of the total number, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Arthur thinks that hiring spree is the biggest reason for the jump in asylum decisions and denials. But he says the ""Matter of A-B-"" ruling may also be a factor. And Arthur praised the Trump administration for trying to close what immigration hardliners  consider ""loopholes"" in U.S. immigration law. He says immigration courts have been flooded in recent years with claims based on gang violence and domestic abuse that should not qualify for asylum. ""These things are reprehensible,"" Arthur said. ""But unfortunately, they're not a basis for asylum relief in the United States.""A loophole, or a basis for asylum?But many immigration lawyers disagree. They say some migrants fleeing gangs and domestic violence should qualify for asylum, because their own governments did nothing to protect them. They argue that these migrants should be considered members of a ""particular social group,"" one of the protected categories in U.S. and international asylum law. That's why the woman from Nicaragua should be allowed to stay here, argues Karen Musalo, the founding director of the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies at U.C. Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. ""She suffered horrendous abuse, she went to the police, really to no avail. And tried to escape him,"" Musalo said. ""And that's really the classic facts of a case that should have been granted."" 'I was his property'On a recent morning, the Nicaraguan woman picked up her son from a neighbor's apartment. He's 3 years old now, an outgoing little kid with a Paw Patrol backpack. After he was born, she says, her boyfriend started to hit him, too.  ""That's when I decided to go the police,"" she said. But the police in Nicaragua never arrested the boyfriend, or even talked to him, she said. When he found out she'd filed the complaint, her boyfriend was furious.""He told me that I was never going to leave him,"" she said. ""That I was going to be with him forever, because I was his property.""That's when she took her son and fled to the U.S. She's now appealing the judge's decision in her asylum case. I asked what she'll do if she loses the appeal. She said she doesn't know, but she can't go back to Nicaragua. "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/686451007/how-the-government-shutdown-is-affecting-weather-forecasts","The weather clearly does not care that the U.S. government is partially shut down.A series of storms has thwacked California, the Midwest and large portions of the East Coast in the past week, dropping rain, downing trees, coating roads in ice and burying cities in snow. An ongoing storm is expected to drop up to 2 feet of snow in parts of New England this weekend.Of course, we know all of this because despite the government shutdown, the National Weather Service is still publishing timely forecasts and warnings that newspapers, TV meteorologists, weather websites and local emergency officials rely on.""We are basically doing the same job we were doing before the shutdown. We just haven't gotten a paycheck,"" says Ray Martin, a senior NWS meteorologist in Sterling, Va., who is that office's union steward for the National Weather Service Employees Organization. ""I can't tell you how many times in the office I've heard the comment, 'Just going to work like usual, not getting paid!' It's definitely taken a hit on the morale.""Under the best circumstances, working for the weather service often means working long hours or for many days on end. Every office is staffed 24/7, including weekends and holidays. Local emergency managers can call any time of the day or night to ask for the latest weather information and get help planning ahead for what that weather might mean for their communities. Martin personally worked 13 days in a row around Christmas, without being paid. He says he doesn't mind the work — in fact, he really likes his job and is happy to keep doing it during the shutdown. But, he admits, ""it is a bit disheartening to realize we don't know when we're going to get paid again.""Recent storms have only added to the weather service workload. ""It is the season,"" says Alicia Miller, a hydrologist and union steward at the National Weather Service office in Pittsburgh. ""January and February can be very active to us.""That means a lot of time at work, without pay. ""I do have two children, and it has been a bit difficult for day care,"" she says. ""It's very hard to explain to day care that I'm working and they have to watch my children, but I'm not going to be able to pay them."" For now, Miller says, she has been cutting back on other expenses to afford day care.Miller says employees will very likely be working overtime this weekend to keep up demand for information about a snowstorm moving across the Midwest and Northeast. And while National Weather Service forecasts are still reliable, there is some weather information that forecasters have to do without during the shutdown. For example, Miller says she hasn't been able to access ice and temperature data from the Great Lakes, which can affect snow forecasts in Pennsylvania and other states east of the lakes. And one of the agency's weather prediction models was supposed to be updated at the beginning of January but hasn't been because of the shutdown.In California, where rain and wind caused car crashes and flooding in some areas, local officials have less flood information than they usually would. Stream gauges maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey aren't being calibrated, which means they aren't necessarily making accurate measurements of how much water is flowing in the rivers.That made at least one local official nervous this week. ""We use stream gauge data on a moment-by-moment basis,"" explains Christopher Berry, the watershed manager for Santa Cruz, Calif. He usually relies on USGS data to know whether the river that runs through the city will flood.""This is the first time I've ever had to say I'm cautious about whether we can rely on the data, because there's no USGS staff working right now,"" he says. The storm downed trees overnight on Wednesday, and the river rose significantly, but it didn't flood. ""I would say we basically got lucky,"" says Berry. He notes that because trees fell in the river and sediment moved around, the stream gauges are even more in need of calibrations that they won't get until the government reopens. ""The next big storm, the gauges will be that much more unreliable."" "

Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, the country's largest mobile phone operator, said early Friday that it had been directed by the government to shut down all Internet access for the second time in a week. ""We were served with another directive for total shutdown of the internet until further notice,"" Econet said in a statement, Reuters reports. The carrier noted that all networks and providers in Zimbabwe had suspended services.Later Friday, Econet said it had received orders to restore access except for some social media applications, Reuters reports. Critics say the government wants to limit Internet access to halt the circulation of images showing security forces responding violently to protests. Photographs show a protester with a broken leg, another with a split lip, and others of protesters being arrested. Activists were challenging the restrictions in court. The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum says the Internet restriction is ""unwarranted, unjustifiable in the circumstances and is a tool of repression meant to mask the massive human rights violations which the state was preparing to commit."" The protests began after the government more than doubled the price of gasoline. Zimbabwe now has the most expensive gas in the world.The government has confirmed three Zimbabweans died in the protests, Reuters reports. The NGO Forum says at least 12 people were killed. As NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports from Johannesburg, ""a Zimbabwean medical association says its doctors have treated more than 150 people since Monday — some with gunshot wounds, others with dog bites.""  The United Nations says it has received reports of security forces using live ammunition, conducting door-to-door searches and arresting more than 600 people nationwide including opposition leaders and activists.""We call on the Government to find ways of engaging with the population about their legitimate grievances and to stop the crackdown against protesters,"" a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement.A prominent Zimbabwean pastor, Evan Mawarire, was arrested during the protests. His lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa told AFP on Thursday that her client is accused of subverting a constitutionally elected government.""The allegations are that he said the government must attend to economic challenges ... and that people must be paid in U.S. dollars,"" she says. ""We don't know what is criminal about that. Everybody is saying that. So everyone who is saying that is subject to arrest.""President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the price increase was needed to combat nationwide fuel shortages. Mnangagwa was elected last year after the dictator Robert Mugabe stepped down following 37 years in power. Initially, Mnangagwa was seen as a more liberal leader. As NPR's Eyder Peralta reports: ""Mnangagwa ushered in an era of historical civic freedoms: Police checkpoints were lifted and for the first time in decades Zimbabweans were allowed to air political views. On election day, last month, many of them said that for the first time, they felt free to walk into a polling place and vote their heart.""Now Mnangagwa is seen as potentially an even more repressive leader than his predecessor.""Our country is going through one of the most trying periods in its history,"" the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' Conference said in a statement criticizing the government's ""intolerant handling of dissent,"" The Associated Press reports.The government's earlier Internet shutdown request, which lasted for two days this week, was challenged in court by media and human rights groups, reports New Zimbabwe.The U.S. Embassy in Zimbabwe issued a statement Thursday condemning the internet shutdown. ""We are concerned by the Zimbabwean government's blocking of Internet services in the country January 15-16 and urge the restoration of access to social media sites and applications,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""We call on the Zimbabwean government to respect its constitutional and international legal obligations regarding the right to freedom of expression.""The partial lifting of the internet closure should ease the economic impact of a web shutdown. Teachers and other public workers who draw their salaries via mobile payments from the government were suffering without internet, the AP reports. Some government workers could no longer pay for public transportation."

Now the newly elected freshmen must decide how they will use their newfound power in the face of the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history. The sharply partisan battle of President Trump's demand for a border wall with Mexico started before the new Democrats even took office and has dominated their first days in Congress. As the stalemate drags on, they are forced to decide whether they will stand with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., or that now is the time to cut deals with Republicans.For many freshmen, starting their service amid the shutdown has been a sharp reminder of the limitations of the power that comes with elected office. Like a lot of these new lawmakers, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., ran on a promise to overcome rancor and get Washington working. The shutdown is not making that easy. ""A lot of us are very much can-do people, we're very concrete people, we're very practical people,"" Slotkin said. ""All I want to do is solve it.""The first weeks of any Congress are supposed to be about basic housekeeping. The party in power passes bills to set its agenda, fill its committees and have meetings to organize. Democrats are still doing most of those things while also trying to figure out how to do the even more basic task of funding the government. So far, the freshmen are sticking together by focusing on Pelosi's demand that Trump agree to reopen the government before starting any real negotiations on the wall or border security. That request allows Democrats to remain unified by focusing on the broad goal without ever having to face very real policy differences they have over border security. Moderate members from areas once held by Republicans, like Max Rose in New York, don't support the same policies as the outspoken progressives who were just elected in solidly blue districts. Rose says the unity over the first step — opening the government — is simple.""That shouldn't be news,"" Rose said. ""I just want to see people get paid.""Rose was one of several freshmen who were part of a bipartisan delegation that went to the White House this week to meet with the president about the shutdown. Even there, they didn't get into the weeds. They just asked to reopen government so the negotiations can move forward.Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips was a part of that group. Like Rose and Slotkin, he flipped a GOP-held district in November on the pitch that he would work across the aisle. Phillips remains in Pelosi's camp on strategy.""It is a unifying perspective,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is we have our border security officers and TSA agents and air traffic controllers, the people who are charged with protecting us aren't getting paid right now.""But many are confronting the pressure to fulfill their campaign promises immediately. Their first weekend home as members of Congress was the exact same weekend that federal workers started missing paychecks. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla., said she is well aware that this group of freshmen wields power, but they still need to figure out how to use it.  ""Don't doubt for a second that we don't understand that we have a lot of leverage,"" Mucarsel-Powell said. ""We need to make this government work for all of us.""It usually takes months, if not years, for the shrewdest of politicians to develop relationships and learn the tactics necessary to really exert influence on Capitol Hill. Freshmen start at the bottom of a 435-person food chain with 435 different priorities. ""We have a system of governance that is designed to make change hard and progress difficult,"" Phillips said. ""It works darn well.""Several members said the shutdown has had the surprising side effect of forcing them to grow close as a group faster than they expected. The freshmen have their own strategy sessions and they are already taking  advantage of being political celebrities who attract lots of media attention.That much was on display when a group led in part by California Democratic Rep. Katie Hill called its own press conference to march to the Senate to demand a meeting with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.""We're ready to negotiate. We're ready to make a deal,"" Hill said. ""But we have to get people paid.""McConnell wasn't there. And he wasn't around a day later when the group returned to deliver a letter demanding that the Senate vote on several spending bills that have already passed the House.The spectacle got a lot of attention, but it didn't move the negotiations forward.Hill, one of the co-chairs of the freshman class, said the representatives have remained unified behind Pelosi so far because her demand has been consistent that she will negotiate on the details once the government is reopened.""We are very much aligned with the strategy of we have to hold strong,"" Hill said.  Navigating bigger policy splits will come later."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/18/685829213/attempts-to-make-shutdown-painless-may-stretch-limits-of-federal-law","In its quest to blunt the effects of the partial government shutdown, the Trump administration is using broad legal interpretations to continue providing certain services.Critics argue that the administration is stretching — and possibly breaking — the law to help bolster President Trump's position in his fight with Democrats over funding for a border wall.Even with the creative use of loopholes and existing funds, though, the actions the administration is taking will be hard to sustain if the shutdown continues to drag on.""As painless as possible""When funding lapses, as happened when lawmakers and the president could not agree on a spending plan before Dec. 22, the federal government must adhere to the Antideficiency Act. That law requires agencies to stop all operations, except under certain circumstances. In the current shutdown, about 25 percent of the government is without funding, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service.Despite the shutdown, the administration has announced that a number of programs will continue to function at least for a while, including food stamp benefits and distributing tax refunds.""Our mission from the president has been to make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law,"" said Russell Vought, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, at a Jan. 7 press briefing.The rationale for continuing operations varies according to the program.The State Department said Thursday it would be bringing furloughed employees back to work because it had located enough funds to cover one additional pay period. In the case of food stamps, formally known as USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the administration was able to take advantage of language in the short-term spending bill that expired in December. That bill allowed appropriations for the program up to 30 days after it ended.So, USDA is working to issue food stamp benefits for February early to meet that deadline. After that, it's unclear what happens if the shutdown goes on for weeks or months. The department has about $3 billion in contingency funds that it can use to support the program, but the amount of benefits for February alone was about $4.8 billion. The IRS is also calling 46,000 furloughed employees back to work without pay to help process tax refunds for tax filing season, which begins Jan. 28 for individuals.The legal argumentThe Antideficiency Act allows the government to continue operations without funding in order to protect human life and government property. This is the provision that keeps FBI and Secret Service agents working during a shutdown.But it also provides an exception for activities ""otherwise authorized by law."" This is the provision the IRS is using to justify processing tax refunds during the shutdown. This exception is supposed to apply to programs or benefits that are funded outside of the annual appropriations process that represent a government obligation that must be fulfilled.""Essentially, the government said that there's an indefinite appropriation to refund [overpaid taxes], so if you overpay your taxes you're entitled to get the money back. People have to go to work to make sure that people get those refunds,"" said Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy at American Action Forum, a center-right economic think tank.Gray said he was skeptical of the administration's reasoning on this point, but after reading the relevant statutes, he thinks they may be correct that they have an obligation to process the refunds or they could have faced lawsuits.Not everyone agrees. Sam Berger, a senior adviser at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, says the move by the IRS is not in line with the law. He says people have a right to get their tax refunds, but there is no set deadline.""There's no understanding from Congress that these tax returns have to go out at a certain time and certainly not that they have to go out during a funding lapse,"" Berger said.Berger was a part of the senior team at the White House Office of Management and Budget at the time of the 2013 shutdown during the Obama administration.He argues that President Trump has been more worried about politics than about adhering to the law.""It's a concern with reducing the political harm to himself. So rather than focus on legal requirements or programmatic concerns, he's largely focused on reducing bad press and keeping important constituents happy,"" Berger said.NPR obtained a letter sent by the Treasury Department to Congress explaining the administration's decision on the tax refunds. ""The law governing payment of tax refunds supports a clear, necessary implication that Congress intended such payments to continue on a permanent basis, notwithstanding a lapse in appropriations,"" the Treasury Department wrote.Moving moneyOutside of the IRS, the Interior Department is also bringing back furloughed workers to help with planning for an offshore lease sale for oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico. The department says it will use leftover funds to support this action.Gray says while budget laws allow some leeway for moving funds around, there's only so much that can be done before the money runs out.""They are sort of looking under the seat cushions — when appropriations acts are passed, they do tend to have some built-in flexibility,"" Gray said. ""There is reprogramming authority for the agencies, but it's limited.""Under the Antideficiency Act, it is illegal for federal employees to spend money in excess of what has been appropriated. Violations are subject to criminal penalties, although no one has been prosecuted under this law.Congress and agency inspectors general can provide oversight for compliance with the act, and disputes over enforcement can be hashed out in court. Some federal labor unions have filed lawsuits challenging the government's authority to force people to work without pay.Beyond the legal constraints, there are likely practical limits to the amount of time and effort federal workers will devote to jobs when they are not being paid. ""When a shutdown goes from the medium to long term, we've never seen that. So my expectation is when we start going from short [term] to medium [term] is basically when folks stop showing up for work,"" Gray said. ""That's when folks start quitting, when the disruption in services becomes more permanent and more lasting."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/686372277/state-department-brings-employees-back-to-work-despite-shutdown","The State Department on Thursday ordered employees to return to work next week, despite the partial government shutdown, saying it would figure out how to cover the next paycheck.In a note posted on its website and emailed to staff, the department said it ""is taking steps to make additional funds available to pay employee salaries.""If the shutdown continues beyond the next pay period, State Department officials say they will have to work with Congress to reprogram funds in order to cover salaries.The partial shutdown that began Dec. 22 caused the furloughs of 23 percent of State Department employees overseas and 40 percent of the domestic employees. Overall, there are 75,000 employees of the State Department, including nearly 50,000 local hires, most of whom are covered by local labor laws and have been receiving pay. Consular services have remained open, funded by passport and visa fees.Employees will have to wait for the shutdown to end to get paid for the time they worked during the shutdown or were on furlough.The statement said the department's leadership has been ""deeply concerned about the growing financial hardship and uncertainty affecting Department employees.""""While the Department has done its best to address matters essential to achieving U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives during the ongoing lapse, it has become clear as the lapse has continued to historic lengths that we need our full team to address the myriad critical issues requiring U.S. leadership around the globe,"" according to the announcement.During a recent weeklong swing through the Middle East, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that morale was good despite the shutdown. And he went ahead and summoned all U.S. ambassadors back to Washington this week for a previously scheduled conference held Wednesday and Thursday.That raised eyebrows among many foreign service officers, as did the inclusion of Susan Pompeo, the secretary's wife, on the Middle East swing. During their travels, he defended her as a ""force multiplier."" Others critical of her attendance on the trip noted the extra expense and staff required to support her and her activities.During the shutdown, foreign service officers have had to embrace unusual cost-cutting measures in order to keep their missions afloat, according to emails seen by NPR.One embassy in Europe was instructed to conserve heat and water because because there was no money in the budget to pay utility bills. Workers at a consulate in South America had to pay for their own gas for visits to Americans held in local jails and prisons. Several emails talked about foreign service officers paying local staff with their own money. All officers asked that their embassies not be identified and that their names not be published for fear of retribution.""It's getting more and more difficult to cover all the bases and figure out how to keep the lights on,"" said Barbara Stephenson, a diplomat and president of the American Foreign Service Association. ""It's a huge drain on time and it has an organizational impact.""Diplomats at one embassy in Africa told Stephenson the local community wanted to start a Go Fund Me campaign when they heard about the furloughs to help out. That sort of thing hurts the image of the U.S. and its diplomats, she said.""If you've got a group of people whose job it is to project American global leadership and competence, and the fact that we're the can-do problem-solving country in the world having an online Go Fund Me campaign, that really ... is not the image you want to project,"" she said."

In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Pelosi. ""I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown.""Pelosi and other members of the congressional delegation, commonly referred to as a ""codel,"" were on a bus headed to the airport to depart, and the Capitol Police already had personnel on the ground in Europe for the trip. Other members slated to be on the trip included House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Mark Takano, D-Calif., and Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass. This is the latest back-and-forth between the president and the new Democratic speaker as a nearly monthlong partial shutdown shows no signs of ending. The two parties remain at a stalemate, with Trump demanding funding for a wall or barrier along the Mexican border and Pelosi and other Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill insisting the government should be reopened before negotiations continue on border security issues. Pelosi fired the first volley against Trump earlier this week, when she wrote that his annual State of the Union address, originally slated for Jan. 29, should be postponed until after the full government reopens, citing, in part, security concerns. Such a planned trip by Pelosi to a war zone had not been publicly announced and would not have been, for security reasons. The speaker would use military planes for such travel, and that is what Trump is now denying her. ""Obviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative,"" Trump added in the letter.Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement that while Trump's letter claimed Pelosi and Democrats were also traveling to Brussels and Egypt, the stop in Brussels was simply for pilot rest and where ""the delegation was scheduled to meet with top NATO commanders, U.S. military leaders and key allies – to affirm the United States' ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance."" A stop in Egypt was not on their agenda, Hammill said. ""The purpose of the trip was to express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,"" Hammill continued, pointing out that the president ""traveled to Iraq during the Trump Shutdown."" Schiff told reporters that the decision was ""completely inappropriate by the president. We're not going to allow the president of the United States to tell the Congress it can't fulfill its oversight responsibilities, it can't ensure that our troops have what they need whether our government is open or closed.""""That work must go on and I think it's vitally important now, in particular that the president has announced withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, that we understand the situation on the ground,"" the House intelligence committee chairman continued. ""We had anticipated important defense and intelligence briefings in Afghanistan. We were looking forward to the opportunity to reassure NATO allies and those shaken by reports that the president has questioned his staff about leaving NATO.""Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., blasted both leaders for their childish actions. ""One sophomoric response does not deserve another. Speaker Pelosi's threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political. President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel to visit our troops in Afghanistan, our allies in Egypt and NATO is also inappropriate,"" Graham said in a statement. ""I am glad the Speaker wants to meet our troops and hear from our commanders and allies. I am very disappointed she's playing politics with the State of the Union. I wish our political leadership could find the same desire to work for common goals as those who serve our nation in uniform and other capacities.""The White House also announced that the administration delegation that was supposed to go to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will no longer attend because of the shutdown. Trump had already canceled his trip to Davos because of the shutdown, but as of earlier Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell were still planning to attend next week.Their planned travels came under criticism after Trump abruptly curtailed Pelosi's trip earlier on Thursday. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that ""Out of consideration for the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay and to ensure his team can assist as needed, President Trump has canceled his Delegation's trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.""NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report.

The town of about 25,000 people was almost completely destroyed by a deadly wildfire last November and almost everyone and everything directly affected is relying heavily on federal aid.So far FEMA and Small Business Administration loans do not appear to be affected. But local officials say the shutdown is causing delays in more under-the-radar infrastructure projects, which could have serious, longterm consequences.""Time is of the essence, we want to try and move this along as much as we can,"" says Marc Nemanic, associate director of the local non-profit 3CORE which is aiding Paradise in recovery planning.A prolonged stall is Nemanic's biggest concern.His organization has been waiting for more than three weeks now to apply for up to $750,000 in disaster grants from the Economic Development Administration, a bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Like other federal agencies, the Department of Commerce is largely closed because of the shutdown. 3CORE is partly funded by the Commerce Department, and partners closely with it to further economic development projects in rural northern California.The latest grant proposal would help Paradise begin planning for its daunting recovery: ""Roads, sewer, water, those essential girders that you're trying to build,"" Nemanic says. He adds Paradise can't afford any delay or uncertainty. Many people here living in limbo — in hotels, shelters, couch surfing — need to see signs of something happening, some kind of progress. Otherwise they'll leave.""You'll start having a brain drain and money leaving the community and making us actually in a worse position than we were before the fire,"" Nemanic says.Wildfire risk is heightenedIronically, wildfire prevention work itself has also ground to a halt on federal public lands in Butte County, and elsewhere. The rainy California winter is a key window for prescribed fire and other mitigation work in the Sierra foothills. At this time of year, federal land agencies are now usually well underway with that work.""Projects they were working on have been on hold since the shutdown,"" says Prof. Don Hankins, a wildfire expert at Chico State University. Federal agency representatives have been absent from local fire planning meetings, which causes headaches and stalls work because a lot of the projects are on a mix of state, private and federal land.""If the work does not happen this season, that equates to another year of increased vulnerability to fire risk,"" Hankins says.In the hamlet of Forest Ranch, on a finger-like ridge just adjacent to where Paradise nearly burned to the ground, Stephen Graydon and his contractors are almost done with a 300-acre prescribed fire and fuels break project. Graydon, who runs a non-profit called Terra Fuego, says there are just eight piles of slash left to be burned. But they can't get the go ahead from the Bureau of Land Management to finish the job because the agency can't send a staffer out to approve it.The area was mostly spared from last November's Camp Fire.""We're trying to get it prepped to where this is a good strategic area and a defensible space,"" Graydon says. ""Right now the more we wait, the more risk we have to take on when we do this sort of thing later in the year.""Contracts like Graydon's are stalled. But so are talks about any future projects on federal land that were already funded and ready to get done before the next fire season. For fire managers, this is a source of particular anxiety given that hundreds of thousands of acres of fire prone national forests in northern California are in dire need of some sort of fuels treatment.""We're creating a negative feedback loop where we're consistently going to get further and further behind,"" Graydon says."

He currently stands at 39 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove.And the movement has come from within key portions of his base. He is:Don't see the graphic above? Click here.""For the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. ""Don't know if that's temporary — tied to the government shutdown — or a broader problem the president is having.""The percentage of people now saying they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing is up to 45 percent, the highest for Trump since December 2017.Don't see the graphic above? Click here.2020 headwindsThe president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him.Just 76 percent of Trump supporters, 69 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him. Many, if not most, of them will likely vote for the president, but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability.For context, in 2010, when asked about then-President Barack Obama, just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him, while 48 percent said they would not. Obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote.But for Trump to have more than half the country already saying it definitely won't vote for him indicates he is facing a difficult re-election.""The president has had his base and not much else,"" Miringoff said, ""and when you look ahead to the election ... he enters with a significant disadvantage. His re-election prospects would definitely be in jeopardy at this point.""Trump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the Electoral College in 2016. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote. He won by about 70,000 votes combined between Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that have trended away from the president during his first two years in office.The Democratic fieldAs for who Trump would face, former Vice President Joe Biden stands apart from the Democratic field, in terms of how Democratic voters feel about him compared to others.Biden is the best-known potential Democratic candidate, and is very well-liked — 76 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have a favorable impression of him. Just 12 percent have a negative view.""If he gets in, he automatically becomes the front-runner with numbers like this,"" Miringoff said. ""He becomes the candidate who you have to get into the mix with and be competitive with him.""Barbara Carvalho, director of the poll, added, ""It is unusual to see a candidate, who's been part of the Washington scene for so long, have such a low unfavorable rating.""Don't see the graphic above? Click here.Bernie Sanders, the principal challenger to 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, is well-known, but between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 Democrats have a negative opinion of him. There are a lot of questions about whether Sanders will be able to keep his base of activist supporters together, four years later, now that Democrats have so many more options.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has an almost equally high favorability rating as Sanders, but is not viewed as negatively. Others are potentially well-positioned, too. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris are in a next tier and have a capability of taking off if they make a good impression as voters get to know them.The poll isn't good news for all potential Democratic contenders, however. The Democratic primary electorate does not appear ready for a billionaire. As former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighs a run, Democrats are evenly split on their views of him, while about half of them haven't yet formed an opinion.A primary challenge to Trump?There has been talk of a primary challenge to President Trump, but no candidate emerges with particular backing.Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Mitt Romney are viewed more unfavorably than favorably with Republicans and Republican-leaning independents — 24 percent view Kasich favorably, 28 percent view him unfavorably; 29 percent view Romney positively, while 48 percent view Romney negatively.Romney has been an outspoken critic of Trump, and the GOP base does not appear to appreciate that.""There is no strong support"" for a primary challenge to Trump, Miringoff said. ""Kasich is not well-known, and Romney is not particularly popular.""In the mood for compromiseAs this shutdown continues, 59 percent said they mostly blame President Trump or congressional Republicans for it.And more than 6 in 10 are in the mood for compromise — 63 percent said they want their elected officials to compromise with people they disagree with rather than stick to their positions, including a majority of Republicans. Just 31 percent overall said they want their elected officials to stick to their positions no matter what.Strong Republicans (50 percent), African-Americans (51 percent), Trump supporters (53 percent), Latinos (55 percent) and Gen Xers (56 percent) are among the least likely to say they want their elected officials to compromise. ""People are looking for compromise right now,"" Miringoff said.But neither side is seen as doing a very good job of it right now — 57 percent think the Trump administration is doing too little to work with Democrats in Congress; 55 percent think that Democrats are doing too little to work with the administration.Neither party is making a very good impression, either. Only about a third of Americans have a positive view of congressional Democrats (34 percent), while a majority (53 percent) disapprove of the job they are doing.An even lower number (29 percent) have a positive view of congressional Republicans and more view them negative (58 percent).The survey of 1,023 adults was conducted from Jan. 10 to Jan. 13 by The Marist Poll for NPR and the PBS NewsHour. Results for all Americans have a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points. There were 324 Republicans or Republican-leaning independents surveyed.

""Today, the GSA OIG confirmed what we all knew: The Trump Administration is in violation of the Emoluments clauses of the United States Constitution,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., in a statement. ""GSA's decision to not consider whether the President's business interest in the Old Post Office lease might be unconstitutional has enabled the President to line his pockets.""Apart from the constitutional issues raised by Trump's stake in the hotel, the building's lease states that no ""elected official of the Government ... shall be admitted to share any part of this Lease, or any benefit that may arise therefrom."" Trump's attorneys have argued that didn't apply since he signed the lease before he was elected. The emoluments clauses have produced several lawsuits during Trump's presidential tenure. One of the lawsuits advancing through the legal system is from the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, who argue the hotel enables Trump to profit illegally off his presidency. Subpoenas in that case went out last month, but Justice Department lawyers are asking an appeals court to block the lawsuit. ""If 'emoluments' include an official's gains from private business activities, the President's interest in the lease raises at least potential constitutional issues. The Foreign Emoluments Clause becomes relevant if the hotel receives payments from or on behalf of foreign governments, or a foreign instrumentality, when its representatives stay or hold events at the hotel or otherwise use its services,"" the inspector general's report finds. ""The Presidential Emoluments Clause becomes relevant if the United States or a State of the United States similarly pays for the use of the hotel's services, or if Tenant receives other benefits from the government related to the hotel.""The GSA inspector general recommends a legal review of the lease but stops short of suggesting it should be canceled. Responding to the report, GSA General Counsel Jack St. John wrote in a memo that GSA made sure its contracting officer was allowed to make an impartial decision. He said the probe ""found no undue influence, pressure or unwarranted involvement of any kind by anyone, including the Executive Office of the President and the Office of Management and Budget.""Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University, said it is unclear what effect the IG report will have. He told NPR the inspector general acknowledged GSA should have ""done something, anything, other than pretend that one of the most high-profile, problematic, festering conflicts of interest imaginable did not exist.""The Trump hotel has long been the center of scrutiny, as lobbyists, conservative allies and foreign officials frequently hold events there, raising questions about whether they are using the president's business — which he still profits from — as a way of currying favor with his administration. In two prominent cases of possible emoluments issues, the government of Saudi Arabia rented 500 rooms at the hotel early in 2017, housing and feeding U.S. veterans who had been recruited for a pro-Saudi lobbying campaign. And later that year, Maine's then-Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, spent four nights at the hotel; he was in D.C. lobbying the Trump administration to rescind a national park designation in Maine.A Washington Post story published Wednesday found that T-Mobile booked several rooms at the hotel for its top officials as they were seeking Trump administration approval of its $26 billion merger with Sprint. And the historic clock tower in the building has remained operational with rangers from the National Park Service staffing it even as most other such historic sites have been shuttered during the continuing partial government shutdown.Subscribe to the NPR Politics Newsletter."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/16/685825449/republicans-praise-democrats-grill-andrew-wheeler-in-epa-chief-confirmation-hear","Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who has been serving as the acting EPA administrator since July, faced Senate lawmakers on Wednesday for his first confirmation hearing to lead the agency.He defended his record on rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations as Democrats assailed his ties to business and his lack of urgency on the issue of climate change.""The Trump Administration has proven that burdensome environmental regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,"" Wheeler said. ""I am very proud of the work I did.""Wheeler has been serving as acting director of the EPA since Scott Pruitt resigned amid ethics scandals that included using agency funds inappropriately for an outsize security detail, luxury travel and a $43,000 soundproof room, among other allegations.Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey tore into Wheeler after the acting administrator claimed he had not formed an opinion on an assessment put out by 13 U.S. government agencies, including the EPA, that showed global warming will cause significant damage to the U.S. economy.""We have several briefings scheduled before I can make further public comments,"" Wheeler said of the assessment, which was published in November.""That's unacceptable,"" Markey replied. ""We're having a hearing on your worthiness for this job and you very conveniently haven't had enough time yet to review whether or not there's an extra level of urgency to this problem.""Democrats, who hold a minority in the Senate, have little chance of blocking Wheeler's confirmation. Nevertheless, they targeted their questions at what they see as Wheeler's shortcomings in carrying out the Environmental Protection Agency's core mission.Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who typically caucuses with Democrats, asked Wheeler if he agreed with the scientific community ""that climate change is a global crisis that must be addressed in an aggressive way.""""I believe climate change is a global issue that must be addressed globally,"" Wheeler answered.Sanders pressed him, noting that Wheeler's opening remarks did not include any reference to climate change:""How does it happen that the nominee to be head of the Environmental Protection Agency does not mention the words 'climate change' at a time when the scientific community thinks that climate change is the great environmental crisis facing this planet?""Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, took Wheeler to task about a meeting he held with coal executive Robert Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry in 2017.Despite Wheeler's ""polite and professional demeanor,"" Whitehouse added, ""I continue to believe that you have your thumb, wrist, forearm and elbow on the scales in virtually every determination that you can in favor of the fossil fuel industry, and I think that is very unfortunate.""Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, shared Wheeler's pro-business approach. However, Wheeler has had more experience at the EPA and in Congress. He began his career as a special assistant in the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics under President George H.W. Bush, report NPR's Rebecca Hersher and Colin Dwyer. Wheeler also worked as a staffer on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the same body conducting his confirmation hearing.After that, Wheeler served as an aide to Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., one of the most vocal climate change skeptics in Congress. Then he entered the private sector, where he lobbied for coal, chemical and uranium companies.Protesters heckled Wheeler as he made his opening statement. One shouted, ""This is outrage. Shut down Wheeler, not the EPA.""Wheeler defended his agency's work in limiting the federal government's oversight over states' water resources. He boasted of allowing states to set their own emissions standards for energy, rather than adhering to the nationwide Clean Power Plan unsuccessfully advanced by Obama. And he told senators the EPA's new Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles rule would help lower the cost of vehicles.Republican lawmakers appeared to give Wheeler their blessing.Committee Chairman Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., thanked Wheeler for withdrawing an Obama-era rule on water monitoring. He said of Wheeler, ""He will be a reasonable voice within the agency.""Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota nodded to Wheeler's experience when he asked, ""Should we bar farmers from being the head of the Department of Agriculture? Should we bar doctors from being the head of Health and Human Services or attorneys from being the attorney general or bankers from being the head of the Treasury Department?""Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, elicited a pledge from the nominee to work on limiting plastic pollution in seas. Sullivan noted that United Mine Workers of America have praised Wheeler.Wheeler's confirmation hearing took place as the government is in its longest shutdown ever. Some 13,000 employees in the agency have been furloughed; another 891 remain on the job.Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen asked Wheeler if he would urge Trump to sign a bill to fund the EPA and put his agency's employees back on payroll. Wheeler declined.Environmental groups have called for Wheeler to be rejected.""Time and again, Wheeler has demonstrated just as much loyalty to polluters and just as much commitment to reining in the EPA's crucial work on clean air, clean water, toxics, and climate action, along with supporting the Trump administration's proposals to slash EPA staff and starve its budget,"" wrote Ana Unruh Cohen, managing director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has filed an ethics complaint regarding Wheeler's overseeing of rollbacks in regulation that benefited the coal industry and other industries he lobbied for. The Associated Press reports that EPA Spokesman John Konkus called that charge ""baseless."""

The group that reached Guatemala on Tuesday is the first wave of a caravan that could consist of thousands. It's the first national border crossed by the migrants on their journey that started Monday night.Some migrants told reporters they were looking for new opportunities in the U.S. Some said they were fleeing violence. But no matter their reason for seeking a new life, they have already become symbols in the ongoing battle between President Trump and congressional Democrats over border security as the government shutdown enters its 26th day.  Trump seized on news of the caravan as another reason to fund his proposed border wall.""A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""Tell Nancy [Pelosi] and Chuck [Schumer] that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!""This caravan is different from the one that traveled to the U.S. in October, reporter Maria Martin tells NPR. ""This particular caravan appears to be composed of disparate migrant groups, each traveling at its own pace.""The first group of several hundred who arrived at the Guatemalan border was held at the border checkpoint of Agua Caliente for several hours as officials checked documentation. Many were then allowed to enter Guatemala, but some unaccompanied minors were returned to Honduras or placed in the care of Guatemalan welfare agencies, Martin reports. ""One caravan member said he wasn't afraid of President Trump and his threat to build a wall,"" Martin adds. ""Many said joining the caravan was their only option, due to a lack of opportunities in Honduras.""Honduran officials have estimated the caravan consists of between 800 and 1,000 people, The New York Times reports. Honduras' National Human Rights Commission says there could be as many as 2,000 migrants in the caravan. Some are traveling by foot, and some hitched rides to the Guatemalan border.""We are going out of necessity, because of the poverty,"" a former police officer, Edilberto Hernandez, told the AP. After losing his job he could find only low-paid construction work, he said. He was traveling with his wife and four children.Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. is ""closely monitoring"" the caravan. ""To be clear — participation in a caravan does not grant you a special status or provide you special treatment,"" she said.The earlier caravan became a pivotal issue in the midterm elections, as Trump used the specter of hordes of criminals crossing the border to energize his base. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials hardened the border in November as they prepared for the first caravan's arrival, installing concertina wire and positioning barricades. U.S. agents fired tear gas at members of that group of migrants, who they said were trying to breach the border. If this caravan reaches the U.S., migrants wishing to seek asylum will join thousands of migrants from October's caravan who are still waiting their turn to apply, The Washington Post reports.""I want to apply for asylum in the U.S., but I would stay in Mexico if I had to,"" 23-year-old Jimmy Senteno, traveling with his 5-year-old daughter, told the Post. Senteno said he hadn't been able to find work in Honduras, and he was afraid to leave his house because of gang violence. So he decided to take his chances with the caravan. ""I know only some in the last caravan made it, but I have to try."""

That has some looking for temporary jobs to pay their bills.In Boise, Idaho, Chris Kirk says he's worked for the federal government for 19 years. He administers contracts for the hundreds of millions of dollars the U.S. Forest Service spends on fighting wildfires. But these days he's on furlough and looking for extra income.His job search was featured on a local television news program. A store owner saw the story and offered him a temporary job.""What I do is basically throw freight around, load boxes, unload boxes, stock shelves and work a cash register,"" Kirk says. It's quite a change from his Forest Service job. Even though he's earning less than a quarter of his federal salary, Kirk says he's thankful for the work and for his new employer's flexibility.""As soon as the government shutdown ends, I have to drop whatever I'm doing and go back to work,"" he says.In Florida, Dorothy Dearborn also administers contracts for the government, but for the space agency NASA.A single mom of three kids, Dearborn says she lives ""paycheck-to-paycheck."" She's using no-interest and low-interest credit cards to get by and says her family has offered help.'We're only looking for people to stay'Finding a temporary job has been difficult, though she did apply to a restaurant. When the restaurant owner learned she'd be going back to NASA after the partial shutdown is over, Dearborn remembers the owner saying, ""That's not going to work for us right now — we are only looking for people who are going to stay.""That's a common problem federal workers say they're encountering. Still a few have found creative ways around this issue.Frank Ruopoli of Charleston, S.C., works as a graphic designer and illustrator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says the 2013 furlough, which lasted 16 days, was hard on his family. So he developed a plan to be prepared for the next partial government shutdown.""What I decided to do is go and get my EMT certificate,"" Ruopoli says. When he's working at NOAA he volunteers as an emergency medical technician with a local rescue squad. But now that he's on furlough he landed a part-time EMT job.""It's a lot of medical transport and what I mean by that is a lot of transporting patients from hospital to hospital,"" Ruopoli says. The job also involves responding to 911 calls and staffing special events.Ruopoli says the new job helped ease the financial burden of this shutdown. Still he's disappointed the country is in this position.""I feel a little betrayed by our politicians. You know they take an oath of office to serve our country and I do the same. I got into this many years ago and I chose to, in a way, serve my country and I expect the same out of my politicians,"" Ruopoli says.He and others interviewed for this story are careful to say their views are their own, not their agencies'. Most also said they were uncomfortable speaking publicly. But given that this is the longest partial shutdown in U.S. history, they hope doing so will encourage the president and Congress to resolve their differences."

Chao says that by mid-December, the FAA had registered nearly 1.3 million drones nationwide and had registered more than 116,000 drone operators.Alphabet, Inc., the parent company of Google, and Amazon.com, Inc., are two of a growing number of companies working to develop prototypes and related infrastructure in hopes of making package delivery by drone a reality.Drones buzzing GatwickBut Chao acknowledges that the rapidly growing drone industry is not without problems and safety concerns. She noted incidents last month in London in which drones sighted buzzing around the airspace near London's Gatwick airport led to the grounding and cancellations of hundreds of commercial airline flights over a three day period, stranding thousands of travelers. Air traffic was also halted into and out of London's larger Heathrow airport for a brief time after drone sightings there.""The department [of Transportation] is keenly aware that there are legitimate public concerns about drones concerning safety, security and privacy,"" she said, adding, ""and recent events overseas have underscored these concerns about the potential of drones to disrupt aviation and the national airspace.""Chao says regulators are developing and drafting regulations to address such incursions, as well as to protect against national security threats and invasions of privacy from drones.Time before rules take effectIt will still be some time before the proposals lifting restrictions on flying drone at night and over people will take effect. The new rules must be first published in the federal registry, which may not happen until after the partial government shutdown ends. That publication would then kick off a 60 public comment period for those wanting to weigh in on the rules.Chao made the comments at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board, which is the world's largest gathering of transportation professionals, bringing together an estimated 13,000 leaders, policymakers, administrators, and researchers from government, industry, and academia."

""Now I'm just a full-time stay at home dad,"" he says.That's the case with many federal child care centers in the Washington D.C. region and with some around the country.While he's been home with his four-year-old twin boys, he and his wife have been footing the child care bill, which adds up to about $2,000 a month; though Lanham says he was recently told that he'd only be charged for the services missed during the government shutdown up until now, not going forward. To him and his wife, the effect is more than dollars and cents. They worry that their boys are missing out on essential time in preschool.And the story isn't any brighter for the child care centers themselves. As they're forced to close their doors, they still need to pay their employees (if they want them to stick around), the rent and all the other costs incurred running a business.When Shanelle Patterson, the director of the child care center at the National Archives and Records Administration, was told to close down, she joined forces with the director of another center, not on government property, about seven miles away in a suburb of Washington D.C.The two directors wanted to consolidate and stay in compliance with state regulations. So, they had to adjust, making sure there were enough teachers and staff for all of the students before moving everyone over.They also had to borrow and buy extra cots for naps — the cots at the National Archives Administration are the property of the federal government.Now there are more than a hundred families among the two centers and the director at the receiving location, Tara Phillips, says their children need to stay close to their regular routines — about 25 percent of the students have special needs. ""So you have to be very careful with the environment, the furniture, the lighting, the people, the noise level,"" Phillips says.There has been more food to cook in the kitchens and more dietary restrictions to keep track of. They've had to start using a public park down the street because the center's playground was too small for all the extra kids.For the most part, Phillips says, they're collaborating and cooperating, which is what preschool is all about."

Officials are warning of downed trees, power outages and impacts on transportation.The Mid-Atlantic has seen about half a foot of snow and can expect another 7 to 8 inches, in addition to freezing rain and sleet, according to David Roth, a forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center. He attributes the extended intensity of the storm to its shape.""It's elongated, that can lead to longer duration events,"" Roth tells NPR. ""D.C. will end up having at least a day and a half [of snow] ... we don't have that many snow events that last that long.""Missouri and Kansas took the brunt of the storm on Friday and Saturday, while snow also fell steadily across Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Tens of thousands of households across the Midwest lost power, according to PowerOutage.US.St. Louis registered just over a foot of snow, and the city of Columbia saw more than 2 feet of precipitation, according to the National Weather Service.The storm froze bridges, knocked down trees and stranded drivers on blocked highways, including I-65 in Indiana and I-44 in Missouri. Officials across the region urged travelers to stay off the roads, warning of delays up to eight hours.Troopers in Missouri responded to nearly 4,000 calls for service and rescued 1,790 stranded motorists, as of Saturday afternoon. There were four fatalities and 57 injuries across the state during the storm.Deann M. Phillips, 53, and Olivia Phillips, 14, died near Clinton, Mo., after losing control on the snow-covered roadway and travelling into the path of a Freightliner truck, according to highway patrol.Another Missouri driver, Hope Wilson, 32, died after sliding sideways across US-24 and hitting a car moving in the opposite direction.In Kansas, a collision of semitrailers caused the death of a 41-year-old driver from Mexico, The Associated Press reports. On the Kansas Turnpike, a 62-year-old man died after his pickup truck skidded and crashed into a concrete barrier, according to highway patrol.On Saturday, Kansas and Missouri officials took to social media to ask residents to watch the weekend's football attraction – the Kansas City Chiefs hosting the Indianapolis Colts – from home.In a lighter storm-related moment, the Chiefs released a video of quarterback Patrick Mahomes strolling through the snow at Arrowhead Stadium. The team commented on Twitter, ""There's snow time like Showtime!"" Crews worked for hours to clear the field of snow of its coat of snow before the NFL divisional playoff game.The storm disrupted air travelers as well as those on the road.

In Columbia, Mo., an American Airlines flight slid off the runway, one Twitter user reported. Further east, snow and freezing rain in western and central North Carolina triggered some 98,000 power outages, according to a news release from Gov. Roy Cooper's office.

President Trump's unexpected announcement last month that troops would leave the country has fueled fears that a power vacuum could strengthen ISIS and cede influence in the region to Iran and Russia. It also provoked concerns about the safety of Kurdish forces who fought ISIS alongside the U.S. in Syria but are considered terrorists by Turkey and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""We recognize the Turkish people's right and President Erdogan's to defend their country from terrorists,"" Pompeo said Saturday, according to NPR's Michele Kelemen, who is traveling with the secretary. ""We also know that those who aren't terrorists, those who were fighting alongside of us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" Pompeo said. ""We are confident we can achieve an outcome that achieves both of those.""Erdogan has said his military is prepared to attack swaths of Syria under the control of the Kurdish People's Protection Units. In a televised speech in December, he said Turkey's army would be ready ""neutralize terrorist organizations"" in upcoming months, according to the Financial Times.When Pompeo said earlier this month that the U.S. wants to ensure ""the Turks don't slaughter the Kurds,"" Turkey denounced Pompeo, saying he exhibited ""a worrying lack of information."" Erdogan also canceled a meeting with Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton.No U.S. personnel have left Syria yet, according to a Pentagon spokesman. A separate spokesman for the anti-ISIS coalition declined to discuss timelines, locations and troop movements, as NPR's Bill Chappell reported. More than 2,000 U.S. troops are serving in Syria. Their exit has not just alarmed the nation's Kurds, but even Christians in the country are afraid of what could happen after the U.S. troops leave, says Bassam Ishak, president of the Syriac National Council of Syria and a U.S. representative of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed Kurdish group.Kurds and Christians in the northeast region ""have tried to put together this pluralistic model which is based on secularism,"" he told NPR.""We stand to lose our way of life, we also stand to lose our property and our livelihood,"" said Ishak. ""We will be like second-class citizens at best, if we survive as Syriac Christians and Kurds.""Pompeo told reporters that he spoke with Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, on Saturday. He said many details around the troop withdrawal still need to be ironed out, but that he was optimistic a ""good outcome"" could be reached between Turkey and Kurdish groups in Syria.Just because a ""couple thousand uniform personnel"" will be leaving Syria, Pompeo said, doesn't mean that U.S. interests have changed.Nor will it stop the United States from trying to get ""every Iranian boot out of Syria,"" Pompeo said. He described a ""big and growing"" coalition to exert pressure on Iran.Special representative for Syria Jim Jeffrey, a former U.S. envoy to Turkey and Iraq, is expected to return to Turkey to continue discussions, Pompeo added.Trump's decision to call back U.S. troops in Syria, who were first deployed in 2015, was followed a day later by the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who wrote a letter to the president saying he had the right to have a secretary of defense ""whose views are better aligned with yours."" The president's announcement also accelerated the resignation of Brett McGurk, the special envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS.Turkey's president wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Trump ""made the right call.""Pompeo also spoke about the partial government shutdown, which has become the nation's longest. ""Morale is good"" among diplomats, he said. ""They understand that there are squabbles in Washington, but their mission remains, their duties continue and they're executing them.""The secretary, who began his trip in Amman, Jordan, on Tuesday, is expected to visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait before returning to Washington."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/12/684468202/on-the-navajo-nation-5-000-workers-dependent-on-a-federal-paycheck","With the partial federal government shutdown dragging on, Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye says Congress should exempt tribes from feeling the effects. Historically, treaties with the U.S. government have guaranteed the Navajo and many other tribes federal financial assistance for health, education and economic development. So the shutdown is having an outsized impact.   On the Navajo Nation, half of the tribe is unemployed. But at least 5,000 tribal members rely on paychecks from the federal government. Missing one, which happened for the first time on Friday, can have painful ripple effects. Community leader Angela Cody said one paycheck often has to feed the immediate family as well as the extended family.""People are worried about their next mortgage payment, their car payments,"" Cody said. ""At the family level there's a lot of stress, finance [sic] stress. As a whole we are dependent on these employees and federal monies every day in some way.""Even if they aren't getting paid, many have to work and so they rely on the federally-funded preschool program, Head Start, to care for their young kids. But the tribe's Head Start program is already shrinking. They lost ten centers last year because there were no buses available to shuttle kids from across the rural reservation to classes.  Now, the program doesn't have the enrollment numbers it needs to stay open. ""I have 12 now,"" Head Start teacher Jensen said. ""We're supposed to have 15. We can't seem to get enough children because of the distance."" Many federal offices across the Navajo Nation are closed because of the shutdown. The federal money Head Start relies on to run the program has been slow to arrive. ""We don't have enough cleaning supplies,"" Jensen said. ""It's a long process to get those kinds of things and so a lot of times we're buying our own supplies to get the kids hands clean.""To make matters worse, unplowed roads made it near impossible for parents to drive their kids to Head Start since the shutdown began. During snowstorms in recent weeks, only half of the Bureau of Indian Affairs crews who help the tribe maintain the roads showed up to clear snow. And those who are working aren't getting paid. There are 1,600 of paved roads and almost 6,000 miles of dirt roads on the Navajo Nation.Head Start teacher Shanelle Yazzie said she could barely get to work.""The only roads being plowed over the last two weeks were the main interstate,"" Yazzie said. ""We don't really travel on that so. The only way you can get by was probably on a four by four and not many people have that out here.""If a dirt road isn't maintained during a snowstorm, a couple things can happen. The snow can melt and make the road impassable or the snow piles up. Either way you're stuck. Navajo president Russell Begaye said many Navajo live without running water and electricity, so they have to haul water to drink and wood to stay warm. And they have to eat. ""Getting out to buy groceries, or maybe there's an emergency where they have to transport a family member to a hospital, maybe to refill their medication or to refill their oxygen tank — so it's a life or death situation in many instances,"" Begaye said.Begaye said if the shutdown continues it's only going to get worse, as the National Weather Service predicts more snow next week."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/12/684459574/shutdown-hampers-wildfire-preparedness-and-training-across-the-country","In Tennessee, a wildland fire training academy was canceled. In California and the southeast U.S., forest cleanup and fuel mitigation projects, intended to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire, are being postponed. In Montana, a workshop designed to help forest managers better prepare communities for fire risk has been scuttled.As the partial government shutdown stretches into its third week, becoming the longest shutdown in U.S. history, hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain furloughed. That includes thousands of people at the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management, who would otherwise be preparing for the upcoming fire season or working on projects to reduce wildfire risk. That lost time is raising concerns from fire officials around the country.""We're fortunate in that fire potential and the fire danger is relatively low across the country at this point,"" said Dan Smith, the fire director for the National Association of State Foresters and a board member for the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. ""But this is the time of year where we make plans and work out processes for the coming year."" With few federal workers left on the job, much of that important planning, training and contracting, he said, is being cancelled or postponed. So too are fuels mitigation projects - prescribed fires or thinning operations - that fire ecologists and forest managers say are vital to reducing the threat of massive, deadly wildfires that have become all too common in many parts of the country.  ""This is the prime time of year for a lot of acreage being burned, especially in the southeast,"" said Jim Karels, the director of the Florida Forest Service, a state agency that has continued to do its own prescribed fires. ""[Federal agencies] are missing quite a few good burning days and a lot of opportunities to reduce fuel."" That's also the case in California, which is still recovering from the most destructive and deadly fire season in its history.President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized California for its forest management policies, tweeting about it again this week and threatening to cut off emergency funds to the state.  Last month he also issued an Executive Order calling for more ""active management"" of forests and other federal lands to reduce wildfire risk.But more than half of the forests in California are under federal control, where prescribed fire - widely viewed as one of the most useful forest management tools - is no longer happening. Forest managers have already lost out on at least 14 good days for burning, the California Tahoe Conservancy told Capital Public Radio. ""Every week is critical,"" said Patrick Wright, the executive director of the conservation group. ""Hundreds, if not thousands, of acres could be affected if the shutdown continues for an extended period. There's the potential for missing an entire field season.""Asked how many fuels mitigation projects like prescribed fire or thinning efforts have been affected by the ongoing shutdown, John Haynes, deputy director of communications at the U.S. Forest Service, wrote in an email: ""We are unable to speculate on specific impacts such as those you are asking about while the government is ongoing and ever-changing.""Training opportunities for state, federal and local firefighters are also being put off. The Tennessee-Kentucky Wildland Fire Academy,  a 25-course, two-week training event, was canceled earlier this month. Tim Phelps, the Forestry Communications and Outreach Leader at the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, said that roughly two-thirds of the academy's attendees and many of its presenters were federal employees. ""That limits much-needed training, everything from basic firefighting to more advanced courses,"" he said. ""We're scrambling to figure out how to now get our state folks the training that they need."" Phelps and other state land offices said that this shouldn't immediately affect their ability to respond to wildfire. State and local firefighting agencies put out the majority of the nation's wildfires and can find other ways to get critical training. It could be a setback, though, for individuals who are looking for specific qualifications for the upcoming fire season, and it could disrupt the larger flow of the country's fire management structure.          ""Some of the training sessions that are being canceled feed people into our incident management teams, and our incident management teams have some critical shortages in them. So it just puts us behind in that process of developing a pipeline of succession,"" Michael DeGrosky, chief of the Fire Protection Bureau at Montana's Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, told Montana Public Radio. A three-day workshop in Montana that aimed to improve the way fire and natural-resource managers work with communities to build wildfire resilience was also canceled due to the ongoing shutdown.While the workshop's cancellation won't impact the immediate preparedness of firefighters in that state or others, Philip Higuera, an assistant professor at the University of Montana and one of the workshop's organizers, said it's a setback.  ""This is an example of how the shutdown has more far-reaching consequences than we - citizens, scientists, or politicians - initially anticipate,"" he said."

The agency has announced it is taking what it calls the ""extraordinary step"" of using money from entrance fees to pay for cleanup.But, despite the shutdown, the Trump administration is continuing work on one of Interior's biggest, most controversial priorities: opening up more Arctic lands in Alaska to oil drilling. The Bureau of Land Management, an agency under the Interior, has gone ahead with a series of public meetings on its effort to expand oil development in the 22-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. E-mails obtained by Alaska Public Media show that on January 3 — two weeks into the shutdown — a BLM employee was contacting Alaska community leaders to schedule meetings related to oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Congress legalized drilling in the refuge just over one year ago, after decades of opposition from conservation groups. When contacted last week by Alaska Public Media, the employee's email account sent an automatic reply: ""Due to the lapse in funding of the federal government budget, I am out of the office. I am not authorized to work during this time, but will respond to your email when I return to the office.""Following public outcry and a letter from a Democratic congressman after Alaska Public Media's report, the Bureau of Land Management this week announced it is postponing the Arctic Refuge-related meetings.The letter came from the new chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, a Democrat who strongly opposes to oil development in the Refuge.""The work for gas and oil continues, despite the shutdown, despite fact that people are not being paid, despite the fact that our parks are suffering,"" Grijalva said in an interview.In his letter, Grijalva wrote that he thinks holding meetings to advance oil development with limited public communication during the shutdown raises transparency issues.Moreover, Grijalva is demanding more details on how Interior is paying for the work. He thinks the agency may be violating a federal law that limits government spending before Congress appropriates funding.Others are asking the same question.""The administration seems to be in a grey area, legally,"" said Matt Lee-Ashley, who served as deputy chief of staff at Interior under the Obama administration and is now with the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""At least in the past administration, the lawyers in the Department of Interior were crystal-clear that civil servants weren't to be doing activities where there was no clear appropriation from Congress, and made clear there were criminal penalties associated with that.""Interior officials declined to be interviewed for this story. But in a letter responding to Grijalva sent Thursday, Brian Steed, Interior's deputy director for policy and programs, wrote that the agency consulted with its solicitor's office and determined the work was legal using money from a previous fiscal year, ""as long as a limited number of staff were involved.""""The planning process for both of these efforts are critical to the state of Alaska and the nation,"" Steed wrote.Grijalva's colleagues in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee say they support Interior's actions. That committee is chaired by Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who championed the legislation that opened a part of the Arctic Refuge for oil development known as the 1002 Area. ""One of Interior's essential missions is producing energy for the good of the country,"" a spokeswoman for the committee said in a statement. ""What they're doing to advance development in the NPR-A and 1002 Area is fully legal, a top priority, and we strongly support it.""But Interior's continuation with the public planning process to advance oil development in Alaska during the shutdown has led to confusion.Suzanne Little, an officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts who serves on an advisory council for the Bureau of Land Management, had been planning to fly to two Arctic communities last week to attend the scheduled public meetings about the National Petroleum Reserve. But with the shutdown, she wasn't sure if the meetings were still happening. After repeatedly trying to reach her contact at the agency, she cancelled her plane tickets.Hours later, Interior sent an email saying they were going forward, after all.Little was able to reschedule her flight and made the meetings. But, she said, ""it was very frustrating that there was nobody to answer phones in the office, yet the meetings were going to continue."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684459830/federal-employees-deserve-better-workers-rally-as-shutdown-frustration-builds","As federal workers miss their first paychecks since the partial government shutdown began three weeks ago, frustration, anxiety and anger are rising. Across the country this week, federal workers and industry leaders are starting to organize and rally to demand an end to the partial government shutdown. ""Trump, open the government — today,"" chanted the hundreds of federal employees and aviation industry executives gathered on the Capitol lawn in Washington, D.C., Thursday.Rallies also took place Thursday in Dallas, Covington, Ky., Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Chicago and St. Louis. More rallies are happening Friday and this weekend in Columbus, Ohio, Boston and, for the second day in a row, in the nation's capital.The shutdown is affecting some 800,000 employees. An estimated 420,000 are working without pay and about 380,000 are on furlough and staying home, also without pay, according to Senate Appropriations Committee. The crowd roared and cheered holding signs that read ""We Want to Work"" and ""Congress Do Your Job So We Can Do Ours."" Many showed up with their children despite the blustery weather.One furloughed rally attendee had a baby strapped to her back, with a sign that read ""Let My Mommy Work"" taped to the carrier.  David Baker, 35, was among those chanting loudly. He's an air traffic controller in Norfolk, Va., and came to the rally to tell Congress and the White House to end the shutdown. ""It's extremely disappointing to know that our leaders can't get something done,"" he said.Baker and his wife have two boys — ages eight and three. He says every day that goes by, his family feels a heavy financial burden as bills roll in. ""It's unacceptable,"" he says. ""We've spent the last week calling our mortgage company, our car loan company, calling credit cards and our day care provider saying 'we don't know if we are going to make this month's payment."" It's hard, he adds, to prioritize whether to go to the grocery store or pay your mortgage. He takes a deep breath and adds, ""federal employees deserve better."" Baker is one of many employees worried about the financial impact of the shutdown. Christina Lewis, a single mother who works as an air traffic controller, said she just had her cell phone shut off. Other workers said they're  tapping into savings to pay their mortgage and recurring bills. This shutdown may become the longest one in U.S. history.Sara Nelson, international president for the Association of Flight Attendants, represents 50,000 employees. She's concerned about flight attendants' security, safety and their economic stability. When the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration are not operating at full capacity, she says, ""we are less safe and we are less secure. Safety and security is not negotiable."" Nelson believes the push for border security, which has stalled congressional negotiations, is important. But, she adds, ""you cannot expect a workforce to come to work and do their job when they have to be concerned about the safety and security of their own families.""Mike Perrone, president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, also feels that if the shutdown persists air safety will eventually become compromised. He represents aviation safety inspectors, flight inspection pilots and others working to keep the system safe and running. He said with inspectors not working, a layer of safety is missing. ""They are not inspecting airplanes, they are not inspecting the pilots."" Perrone said the system is not unsafe right now, but worries about what will happen as time goes on. At the Washington, D.C., rally, Pete Bunce, the president of the General Aviation Manufacturing Association says workers stand to lose even more as time goes on. ""As the shutdown continues, it is having tremendous impact that it will ultimately result in our having to lay off employees,"" he says.Bunce said that to be able to build and deliver aircraft, his industry needs FAA inspectors to be able to get the safety oversight approvals that make the U.S. aviation system safe. ""That's not happening right now,"" he said. ""If the shutdown continues, it is going to have impact in the billions of dollars to our industry."" Hafsa Quraishi is an intern on NPR's National Desk."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684414651/thousands-face-threat-of-eviction-after-hud-contracts-expire-due-to-shutdown","With the partial government shutdown on the verge of becoming the longest in U.S. history, many housing advocates fear thousands of low-income Americans are at risk of being evicted. More than 1,000 government-backed housing contracts have already expired and potentially more will do so in the coming weeks.Since the shutdown began last month, approximately 1,150 federal rental assistance contracts have not been renewed due to funding lapses at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.These lapses impact Project-Based Rental Assistance agreements between private property owners and the federal government. These landlords are contracted to house low and very low-income residents. The property owner charges tenants modest rents and HUD kicks in subsidies to make up the difference.While the expired contracts so far only account for about 5 percent of HUD's project-based contracts, it is causing concern that more of the 1.2 million low income families housed in these multifamily properties will be in danger of losing homes as the shutdown lingers.In a letter to landlords earlier this month, first reported by the Washington Post, HUD urged property owners to dip into their reserve accounts ""to cover funding shortfalls"" as a way to try to keep tenants in place.The National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, mapped the expired and soon to be expired HUD contracts to highlight the impact the shutdown is having on low income renters.""Funding these contracts is necessary to keep about 150, 000 deeply poor, mostly seniors and people with disabilities safely and affordably housed,"" said Diane Yentel, President and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.Yentel worries that, with President Trump and Congressional Democrats at an impasse over border wall funding, the government will not reopen anytime soon. And that may force property owners to make business decisions that could adversely impact tenants.""Eventually these owners will have to resort to either significant rent hikes or evictions of these lowest-income renters,"" Yentel said.Eric Johnson is the executive director of the Oakland Housing Authority which manages approximately 550 project-based properties on behalf of HUD.Two properties he oversees, one in San Jose and another in Sacramento, have around 75 housing units between them. Johnson said neither of the properties received their January payments from HUD.""So they're functioning right now without really having any income from the program to support their efforts."" Johnson said.He said those property owners, like many other across the country, will not be able to operate indefinitely from their reserves. He fears a prolonged shutdown is not good for the strength of the housing market overall.""I'm more concerned about them ending up going into foreclosure and bankruptcy on these properties than I am really about them evicting residents,"" Johnson said.Mary Cunningham is the vice president for Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank. She said the lapse in funding may deter other would-be tenants from entering into a contract with HUD in the future.""I think this shutdown sends a very dangerous message to landlords, which is the government doesn't pay its bills,"" Cunningham said.Officials said HUD always repays landlords and that the department has had ""no tenant evictions as a result of an interruption in housing assistance payments.""But these are uncharted times.On Saturday, the shutdown becomes the longest in U.S. history. And in the coming weeks some 500 HUD more contracts expire at the end of the month. Another 550 expire by the end of February."

If no deal is struck by midnight Friday, this partial shutdown will be the longest ever. From late 1995 to early 1996, the government was shut down for 21 days. Friday is the 21st day of this current shutdown. Neither side appears ready to budge, and this poll and others make Democrats feel they have the upper hand. And they have reason to feel that way — about 7 in 10 in the NPR/Ipsos Poll also say the government shutdown is going to hurt the country, that it will hurt the economy and that Congress should pass a bill to reopen the government now while budget talks continue. Just 3 in 10 believe the government should remain closed until there is funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Don't see the graphic above? Click here A Reuters/Ipsos Poll out Tuesday found that 51 percent of Americans said President Trump ""deserves most of the blame,"" up 4 points from late December 2018 around when the shutdown began. A YouGov Poll out this week found 50 percent also blamed Trump, also up 4 points from late December.The NPR/Ipsos Poll also found that Trump's Oval Office address Tuesday had little effect. Just 10 percent of Americans said the president's speech brought the country closer to ending the government shutdown. (Nearly 4 in 10 said they did not watch or even follow the address.)And not many, if anyone, beyond his base say his speech convinced them that there is a ""crisis"" at the Southern U.S. border. Just 38 percent of Americans overall said his speech convinced them of a crisis at the border, and only about a third said his speech convinced them there is a need for a wall along the border. Independents are not with the president on either of those critical points. By a 23-point margin, 50 percent to 27 percent, independents said they disagreed that the president's speech convinced them of a need for a wall, and by 45 percent to 32 percent, independents said the president's speech did not convince them of a crisis at the border. Fifty-three percent of independents said it's never OK to shut down the government, as did 50 percent of Democrats. Just 25 percent of Republicans, though, said the same.About two-thirds of Republicans said the president's speech helped convince them there's a crisis at the border and a need for a wall.As Trump looks toward re-election, his base has been solidly behind him. Immigration and the wall have been animating issues that have helped galvanize that support. Democrats, though, believe that while the president may have run and won, in part, on his hard-line immigration stance, it was also litigated during the 2018 midterm elections — when Democrats took back the House.One reason the shutdown could drag on is that few people say they are directly affected by the shutdown: But that doesn't mean Americans aren't sympathetic to federal workers — 56 percent don't think federal workers should be working without pay to keep government services running, and 83 percent think they should get back pay for the time they do work. Two-thirds even think federal contractors should get back pay. (Trump said on Friday that he would sign a bill passed by Congress to give back pay to federal workers once the shutdown ends.)What's more, when asked what they think about the shutdown, the most prevalent answers were that it was unfair for workers, that it was wrong and that too many were working without pay.Not helping matters for either side is that the leaders in this showdown are not viewed favorably: The survey was conducted by Ipsos Jan. 9-10 with interviews of 1,003 adults online. It has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684037990/border-patrol-makes-its-case-for-an-expanded-border-barrier","Senior Border Patrol officials are taking up President Trump's call for more miles of border barrier, pushing back against congressional Democrats who say additional fencing is unnecessary.During a ride-along with the Border Patrol on Wednesday in its San Diego sector, agents made it clear that the fence deters illegal crossers.""I started in the San Diego sector in 1992 and it didn't matter how many agents we lined up,"" said Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott. ""We could not make a measurable impact on the flow [of undocumented immigrants] across the border. It wasn't until we installed barriers along the border that gave us the upper hand that we started to get control.""Forty-six of the 60 miles of border in the San Diego sector are currently protected by some type of barrier. Scott says in the places where he has two levels of fencing he achieves 90 percent operational control.Scott was interviewed in a clearing at the base of the San Ysidro Mountains, a rugged sierra in southern San Diego County. For years, agents have considered the harsh terrain here to be a natural deterrent to illegal crossers. It is mainly Bureau of Land Management land with rocky inclines covered in cactus and juniper.Even though the traffic here is at relatively low levels, the San Diego sector is now seeking 5 miles of additional fencing across this mountainous ground to stop the illegal movement of humans and drugs.""Every night people come through this canyon,"" said Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Michael Scappechio. ""If we put in a border barrier, we can utilize the [agent] manpower elsewhere.""He added that a steel fence is a smarter border defense than having agents in ATVs or on foot chasing people crossing illegally through remote and rocky ravines, which is dangerous for the pursuer and the pursued.Replacing and installing new fencingCurrently, according to the spokesperson for the CBP's San Diego sector, they're  spending $10.5 million a mile to replace 14 miles of old fencing with 18-foot-tall, state-of-the-art, steel bollard barrier between San Diego County and Tijuana. Trump has asked for an additional $5.7 billion for 234 miles of new steel slat fencing in sections along the entire U.S.-Mexico boundary. That works out to $24.4 million a mile. Critics have demanded to know why Trump's wall is so much more expensive than current fence construction.A senior official with Customs and Border Protection told NPR that the added expense comes from building access roads, installing sensors and acquiring private land — which accounts for most of the borderland in Texas.While Trump argued on Tuesday night in a prime-time address to the nation that a border wall was critical to border security, Democrats took issue. ""In no way did the president's speech last night make a persuasive or even a new case for an exorbitantly expensive border wall,"" argued Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Asked what he would tell opponents to Trump's wall, Scott said sector chiefs like him have actually been asking for more tactical barriers for years, ""and all of a sudden it got unbelievably political overnight.""A veteran Border Patrol agent in the San Diego sector, who asked not to be named, said he and other agents are in favor of more miles of robust fencing. ""Natural barriers don't work anymore. [Illegal crossers] come right through mountains and deserts now."" He added, ""But holding agents and federal employees hostage over this fence is crazy."" He spoke on the day his CBP paycheck should have been deposited in his bank account but was not owing to the government shutdown. Some Border Patrol agents say privately that the administration is putting too much emphasis on the wall and it needs to keep a more holistic vision of border security that includes technology such as remote mounted cameras, sensors, lights and tethered spy blimps, as well as manpower.Migrants wait in TijuanaAcross the border in Tijuana, the number of Central American migrants who arrived in a caravan in November has dropped from 8,000 to 2,000. Those remaining are waiting for their turn to ask U.S. officials for asylum or contemplating brincando el muro — jumping the fence — to surrender to agents. Scott said his agents have arrested more than 2,500 migrants from the group who crossed the border illegally, pushing aside or climbing over old sections of sheet metal fencing.Critics have lambasted San Diego agents for firing tear gas at groups of migrants who attempted to breach the border barrier in two separate incidents in the past few weeks. Photographers captured images of mothers and children running from clouds of gas.Scott said his agents were being pelted with rocks from the south side of the border. ""My agents have a right to protect themselves and will continue to do so,"" he said. ""When they are assaulted, they will respond in the safest manner they can.""Both incidents are under investigation by CBP's Use of Force Review Board.Since the last tear-gassing on Jan. 1, caravan migrants are deciding not to cross illegally in big groups in front of news cameras, said Soraya Vazquez Pesqueira, a Tijuana attorney and immigrant activist. ""They've seen that there is a violent response from the U.S. authorities. Now if they cross illegally, they do so individually or in small groups, that don't call attention to themselves. They're more careful.""U.S. border officials allow about 40 to 60 Central Americans from the caravan into the San Ysidro Port of Entry each day. Those who seek asylum are usually released with an electronic ankle monitor and given a date to appear before an immigration judge. Those who are simply looking for work, which Scott says accounts for the majority of Hondurans he sees, are detained and deported.Remain in MexicoOn Dec. 20, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced a ""historic measure"" that would require all asylum-seekers at the Southern border to return to Mexico and wait there while their cases are resolved. The dramatic policy announcement was the administration's attempt to cease the ""catch and release"" of migrants who come to the U.S. border seeking protection.A senior administration official familiar with border security negotiations, who asked not to be named, told NPR the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy has been suspended for the time being, because of ""diplomatic complexities."" Mexican officials have expressed concern that their northern border cities cannot accommodate thousands of additional poor migrants waiting around for months while their cases wend their way through backlogged U.S. immigration courts.A spokesman for Mexico's foreign minister told NPR's Carrie Kahn that he does not have any information about a suspension of the program nor any comment."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/683920624/once-a-fence-later-slats-almost-always-a-wall-trumps-border-wall-contradictions","Politicians often have to change course when their campaign promises run up against reality. But when President Trump ran for office, and throughout his presidency, an explicit part of his pitch was that he wasn't like all the other politicians. Trump's ""great wall"" was a big concrete symbol of that.Except that now it isn't even concrete. In recent weeks, he has been saying it will be made of ""beautiful"" steel slats. The way Trump has described the wall has changed a lot over time, to the point of contradiction. That includes how the wall will be paid for.The president is now in a battle with congressional Democrats to approve $5.7 billion in funding for a physical barrier, placing the wall at the center of a lengthy government shutdown that Trump is struggling to find his way out of.In April 2014, when businessman Donald Trump was toying with running for president, he told an audience in New Hampshire that he would ""build a border fence like you have never seen before.""That summer, a couple of Trump's advisers came up with the idea of calling it a ""wall"" as a way of signaling Trump would be an immigration hard-liner.""And what better way than to have his brand incorporated by Donald Trump saying, 'Yeah, I'm going to build a wall. Nobody builds like Trump'?"" said former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg.The advisers wanted to ensure that every time he gave one of his wide-ranging, largely unscripted speeches, Trump would hit the theme of being tough on immigration. ""Build the wall"" — like ""Make America Great Again"" — was easy to remember and would fit well in the ""Trump variety show,"" as Nunberg described Trump's rally speeches.""It was fun. It was cool. It was novel,"" said Nunberg.Nunberg wants to be clear: Trump rejected plenty of their ideas. But he went all-in on the wall.In August 2014, Trump sent his first tweet about building a wall. Fittingly, it was in all caps.A few months later, he tweeted again, adding a little more detail. The wall would be ""massive,"" and the funding would come, indirectly, from Mexico.Trump officially launched his campaign in June 2015, with the wall as a centerpiece.""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively,"" Trump said in the gilded Trump Tower in New York. ""I will build a great, great wall on our Southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.""It didn't take long for crowds at his rallies to chant, ""Build that wall, build that wall!"" Sometimes he'd add a question about who was going to pay for it. And arenas full of supporters would respond: ""Mexico!""Early on, when Trump described the wall, he talked about concrete. He mocked those who said it would be hard or impractical. Here are some examples:After Trump became president, though, a dose of reality met his concrete wall. Trump's description of the material started to change. He began referencing a barrier made of steel, rather than concrete. In part, he argued, so that border agents could see through the barrier.""One of the things that's come up pretty strongly is we want to have vision through the wall, because you want to see what's on the other side of the wall,"" Trump said in an interview on Fox News on Nov. 2, 2017. ""You know, you think we're going to build a nice, simple concrete wall, but it's not that simple.""A series of tall, steel bollards (posts) is technically more like a fence than a wall. Still, Trump kept calling it a wall and kept leading chants at his rallies all through 2018.But now, with Democrats refusing to fund the president's wall, he's insisting: ""We are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats.""A day before the shutdown went into effect, the president even went so far as to tweet a clip-art-style rendering he said was a ""design"" of the steel slat barrier.Again and again, Trump said during the presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, one way or another. Now the government is partially shut down with Trump refusing to sign legislation to reopen it until Congress provides funding to build the wall (or steel slat barrier).""Obviously, I never said this. And I never meant they are going to write out a check. I said they're going to pay for it. They are,"" Trump told reporters on his way to visit the border in Texas on Thursday.How would Mexico pay for it? During his campaign, Trump said the U.S. would compel Mexico to pay for it by restricting the flow of remittances, money sent to family members in Mexico by those living and working in the U.S.""It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,"" read a campaign information sheet. (There were other ideas, too.)Recently, Trump has said the wall would be paid for indirectly through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which hasn't yet been ratified, and which economists say is unlikely to dramatically increase U.S. economic growth.Steel slats. Steel barrier. Concrete. Does the difference matter to the people who elected Trump to build a wall?""No, it doesn't matter,"" said Nunberg, the early Trump campaign adviser. ""What matters is that there's something built that is not like anything that is built before. That is bigger. Grander.""Nunberg doesn't claim to speak for all Trump voters. He's looked at recent polling and focus groups and says the wall is still key.""Trump supporters define success on the border as building the wall, and he has to build the wall or get the wall started,"" Nunberg said.Trump's political future may well depend on it.Even Trump said as much.""If I did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me are my senators,"" Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. ""They'd be angry at me. The second ones would be the House. And the third ones would be, frankly, my base and a lot of Republicans out there, and a lot of Democrats that want to see border security."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2019/01/10/684195972/with-trump-at-the-border-a-look-back-at-u-s-immigration-policy","President Trump traveled to a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, today, continuing on his campaign to drum up support for a $5.7 billion border wall. The visit came after weeks of Congressional debate about border security that has resulted in a partial government shutdown.In his address from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump described a ""humanitarian and security crisis at our Southern border,"" and focused on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.But as NPR has previously reported, studies show that undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.This fight over the border wall is just one part of the Trump administration's hardline stance on immigration. He's ended DACA, and pushed to make it harder for people to apply for asylum or to get greencards. He also tried to terminate the Temporary Protected Status program, which was designed to help people affected by environmental disasters or armed conflicts.So we're revisiting this interview with Hiroshi Motomura, an expert on refugee and immigration law who teaches at UCLA Law School. The subject of immigration isn't merely academic for him. He comes from a family with mixed immigration statuses (he himself was declared ""stateless"" at one point,) and has spent decades researching, and living, the shifting fortunes of immigrants and their families.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.What did growing up in a mixed status family look like for you?My father was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Japan. So he was a U.S. citizen by birth. My mother was born in Japan, so she has Japanese citizenship by birth. I was born in Japan. My family brought me to this country when I was 3 years old under a loophole, at a time when the laws were expressly, explicitly racially discriminatory.My brother is six years younger than me, and he was born in the United States, so he had citizenship. So in my own family, my father's a U.S. citizen but really felt Japanese, my mother was a Japanese citizen who felt Japanese, I grew up in this country feeling very American but finding out as a young teenager that I had no citizenship at all.I'll never forget the time my mother and brother and I went to visit relatives in Japan [when I was a young teen.] I had to travel on a document that can be given to refugees. I was a stateless person living in the United States.So it's a lot of details, but I think it shows that in one family, we often have a people separated into different legal statuses by the accident of their birth. And yet functionally, in terms of how they relate to American society, even living in the same household, they're either identical, or separated only by generations.Supporters of immigrants' rights have criticized President Trump for saying he wants to limit family-based immigration. These critics have compared his policy proposals with parts of the Immigration Act of 1924, which had a national origins quota, or the Chinese Exclusion Act. Is that a fair assessment?There's a couple ways to think about the legislative proposals coming out of the White House. We've had a system for many years that has put a high value on family unity. So the proposals would seriously cut back on that.What does that actually mean? Since 1965, we have family-based immigration playing a central role, as it always has, but a central role in a non-discriminatory system — at least as far as the legal categories are concerned. That's meant that we've really diversified who can come to this country.So now, the administration is trying to cut that back. One way to think about that is to look at the consequences: This would really make it hard to immigrate from Latin America. You'd have cutbacks in immigration from Latin America, you'd have cutbacks from Asia. The proposals to cut back on the diversity lottery would cut off a significant amount of immigration from Africa. So at one level it looks like it's very neutral. But the fact is, in historical terms, it's really a rollback to the period from the 1920s until 1965.How important is family-based immigration for the people who come to this country?It's really been a consistent strand in American immigration history that families are the vehicle for integrating Americans into American society, and helping immigrants be productive members of American society. It's not enough to come to this country with a diploma. It's not enough to come with a particular skill set. You have to have people help you become part of American society. And many of the ""immigrant success stories"" we have are people who came with relatively few resources, or not necessarily stereotypically high education levels, but [succeeded] because there was a family standing behind them.There are a lot of misconceptions about U.S. citizens sponsoring family members. Can you help explain the process?In many mixed families, you have a younger child who is a U.S. citizen. And the rules say that when that citizen child turns 21, then the citizen child can sponsor or petition for their parents. But it's not as straightforward as all that. It's true that when the parents have the child turn 21, the child can file paperwork and the parents qualify to get into a category that allows them to get legal status. But there are a couple complications. One is that the sponsor needs to guarantee the financial support of himself and the parents.The other thing is that just because you get into a line, it doesn't mean you can get legal status. The system is actually incredibly complicated, and there's talk about, Why don't you stand in line? And yet, we have situations where even people who qualify for a status find the going very difficult.Looking at the system as a whole, we have an emphasis on employment-based immigration that pretty much requires that you have a college degree. And yet the economy seems to have a very great need for people who don't have a college degree, though many of them are actually very highly-skilled. And one of the reasons that in many of these families, the parents come without legal status is because the system has been set up in such a way that we, for several generations now, have tolerated, and even acquiesced, and to some extent invited people to come outside the law. Occasionally it becomes politically expedient to enforce the law harshly, and we express some shock that people are in the country working illegally.And yet, that's the way the system has run for at least 50 years, and to some extent the last hundred years. Especially regarding workers from Latin America who have been essential to many industries, but for whom there's no actual line to stand in.Historically, how has the United States treated immigrants?I think the arc of American history has been one of generosity toward immigrants, punctuated with periods of retrogression, downright repression. That's been the flow.And we see this actually in the fact that the people who are kind of being hard-line against immigration now are often the very people who would've been discriminated against in an earlier age.So one can look at this as hypocrisy, or irony, but the fact of the matter is, it's also a sign that this country moves forward. And the people we discriminated against in an earlier generation, my God, they've become so American that they can actually discriminate against others.How do you feel about United States Citizenship and Immigration Services taking the line ""nation of immigrants"" out of its mission statement in [February 2018]?Well, I think it's very troubling. The reality is, the United States is, and will continue to be, a nation of immigrants. I'm really focusing not on the possibility that one administration or one agency can change the nature of this country or the character of this country. But I'm focusing on what that means. And I think that it really means that the government is not really taking seriously the types of contributions that immigrants have made to this country. And I think the government is really adopting the posture of, You can only come to this country if you're going to jump through a lot of hoops. You're going to pay a lot of money. And it's going to be based on what you can do for us now. As in tomorrow. Or even today.But I think many of the contributions that immigrants have made to this country have not been very obvious on Day 1. This is the many stories we have of people who came to this country either penniless or at least under modest circumstances, and really contributed and created jobs and created entire industries. And I think a lot of what I see in the removal of ""nation of immigrants"" is, are we not understanding the history of this country? We're being extremely short-sighted about what has made this country great.A previous version of this story ran on February 28, 2018."

As he left the White House on Thursday morning, Trump said he has the ""absolute right"" to declare a national emergency in order to construct a border wall but said he prefers to continue efforts to make a deal with Congress. However, he said, ""If we don't make a deal, I think it would be very surprising to me"" to not declare an emergency.Such a declaration would almost certainly be fought in court.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sidestepped a question about the issue Thursday, telling reporters, ""If and when the president does that, you'll find out how we will react.""She predicted that if the president did take that step, he would have to answer to his own party for ""usurping"" power.On Thursday, Trump again said Republicans are unified in support of him on the wall, saying he hasn't ""ever seen unity like this in the Republican Party.""However, several Republican senators have expressed concern over the effects of the continued partial government shutdown, now in its 20th day, and a handful of Republicans voted with Democrats in efforts to reopen the government in the House.Trump also disputed characterizations of Wednesday's meeting with Democratic leaders, from which Trump abruptly walked out. On Thursday morning, he told reporters that ""I didn't pound the table. I didn't raise my voice, that is a lie,"" adding, ""I don't have temper tantrums. I really don't.""In her news conference, Pelosi suggested that Wednesday's White House meeting with Hill leaders was never about a serious negotiation. ""I think the meeting was a setup so he could walk out,"" she said.Recounting an exchange during the meeting, she said, ""I said to him: You are moving the goal posts so many times they are out of the stadium.""She said the president keeps changing his demands: ""I don't even know if the president wants the wall."" Democratic congressional leaders have refused to go along with Trump's demand for border wall funding, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has refused to take up Democratic measures to fund government agencies that have run out of appropriations.Some 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without paychecks because of the standoff. Many will be missing their first paychecks on Friday. The FBI Agents Association, whose members are among those working without pay, sent a petition to the White House and congressional leaders warning of the effects of the shutdown on agents and their work. It says that FBI agents could face difficulty in obtaining or renewing security clearances if they miss bill payments and that ""pay uncertainty undermines the FBI's ability to recruit and retain high-caliber professionals.""Trump also said that despite his repeated campaign promises to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it, he didn't mean that literally.""When I said Mexico would pay for a wall in front of thousands and thousands of people,"" Trump said, ""obviously I never meant Mexico would write a check.""But a March 2016 memo from the Trump campaign to the The Washington Post said, ""It's an easy decision for Mexico. Make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year."" Trump also announced on Twitter that he has canceled a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, later this month for the World Economic Forum, blaming Democrats' ""intransigence"" on border security.It's unclear what could break the impasse, as the White House has not outlined any Democratic priorities it is willing to offer in exchange for wall funding. Vice President Pence told reporters Thursday that the president was not interested in offering concessions on DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allows some people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children to be shielded from deportation. Legal challenges to the Obama-era program are playing out in the courts, and Pence said the president prefers to let the Supreme Court weigh in on the matter first.Pence also defended the president's right to use emergency powers to sidestep Congress to build a wall without lawmakers' consent. Trump believes he ""has an absolute right"" to declare a national emergency, although he offered no timeline for when the president might consider invoking those powers.The vice president also said the administration would not agree to sign any of the seven outstanding funding bills to reopen government, even though six of the seven bills have nothing to do with the border fight and have left hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay. ""Nothing is going to move until we reach an agreement,"" he said, adding that there could be no agreement without a border wall. ""No wall, no deal."" Other attempts to forge a solution have also failed. A small group of Senate Republicans, led by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., launched their own talks to end the shutdown on Wednesday after the failed White House meeting. They huddled with moderate Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to vet their options before talking to McConnell and Pence on Thursday. But by the end of the day, Graham was already declaring defeat.""We're stuck,"" Graham said. ""I don't know what else to do.""In a statement Thursday evening, Graham urged Trump to invoke emergency powers, adding: ""I hope it works.""Collins said the talks ran into difficulties when it became clear that Trump and Pelosi are still ""dug in."" ""It is very difficult when we are dealing with people who do not want to budge at all in their positions,"" Collins said. ""And that's the president and Speaker Pelosi.""At the roundtable discussion in McAllen, Trump heard from relatives of law enforcement officers who were killed by immigrants who were in the country illegally. With weapons, cash and drugs seized at the border on display in front of him, Trump said news reports, which have called the situation at the border a manufactured crisis, are wrong. ""What's manufactured,"" he said, ""is the word 'manufactured.' ""He said Democrats were in ""an indefensible position"" and are all ""looking at 2020.""Trump also addressed other criticism. ""They say a wall is medieval. Well, so is a wheel,"" he stated. ""A wheel is older than a wall.""Fact check: False. The wall predates the wheel by some 4,500 years.NPR's Domenico Montanaro, Deirdre Walsh, Susan Davis and Kelsey Snell contributed to this story."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683716451/with-key-government-agencies-shut-down-science-sputters","Big, important scientific breakthroughs are built of small, incremental experiments. And the partial government shutdown is already interfering with some of that research.  Scientists often depend on the government for grant funding, expertise and — in some cases — even regulatory approval. With the shutdown, some researchers are missing those key elements of scientific collaboration. Here's how some scientists say the shutdown is affecting their work.Ari Friedlaender, a marine biologist with University of California, Santa Cruz, writes, ""Because of the shutdown we were not able to get our permits completed and signed so we are hamstrung from collecting some critical data and deploying tags on whales to study their behavior and population structure.""The research, he says, involves placing motion-sensing tags on humpback whales in the Antarctic ""that measure their underwater behavior and feeding rates and allow us to understand how these animals behave and are affected by environmental change and how these changes might put them into competition with other krill predators like penguins in certain areas."" Friedlaender says he was hoping to get the permits before heading out into the field. ""Since [humpback] whales are federally protected, we require a handful of permits to do research with them and with the shut down the folks in the permit office simply couldn't get things done for us."" Now, he says, he can't communicate with people at the National Science Foundation he needs to. ""We have people in the field that can't do what we intended to do,"" he says. ""Very sad and debilitating feeling for sure.""Update, 4:45 p.m., ET: Since publication, Friedlaender has received word through an independent contractor that his whale research permits have been approved and his team can resume their work immediately. ""I already called the field teams and passed on the good news"" he says. He's especially grateful to the contractors who helped with permitting. It shows, he says, ""with enough people working hard among the chaos that things are getting done.""Tuesday Simmons, a graduate student in microbiology at the University of California, Berkeley, writes, ""I'm a grad student at Berkeley, but my PI [principal investigator] works for the USDA (like several PIs in my department). While the grad students continue to work, it is difficult for us without our advisers here."" She says this affects her in two primary ways. ""I am trying to complete a manuscript with my adviser and I need to meet with him to discuss figures and text edits,"" Simmons says. And she says she is ""trying to plan a new experiment where I'm adding synthetic microbial communities to sorghum plants, and I need to iron out the details with him before starting the experiment."" Simmons points out that it's hard to hit the pause button on plant research.  ""The plants continue to grow and need care (such as water and maintained growth chambers). During this time, many plants are dying, time points for experiments aren't being collected, and plants are maturing without people to collect their seeds. This can set experiments back weeks, months or, in some cases, up to a year. Honestly, the labs with grad students are the lucky ones, because we're allowed in to take care of plants.""Andrew Leifer, a physicist at Princeton, says, ""I'm a newer assistant professor and I've been trying hard to land my first federal grant, which is crucial for funding my research into how the neurons in a worm's brain generate its behavior.""In mid-December, he was on the cusp of hearing whether he was about to receive a grant from the NSF. He says they were going to let him know in the new year.  ""And then the shutdown happened and so for the past three weeks I have been anxiously waiting to hear if my research will get funded,"" Leifer says. ""It is my understanding that NSF employees are barred from even checking their email and are not allowed to discuss any NSF related business. So I will just wait. But not knowing impedes my ability to plan or to hire people, or even knowing whether I should be trying to recruit additional grad students. Admittedly, this is minor in the scheme of things, but I think it illustrates just how pervasive the negative consequences of the shutdown are for science, and it will only get worse with time.""Alison Stimpert, a marine biologist with California State University, writes, ""Even though I am continuing to work, many of my collaborators (USGS, NOAA) are furloughed and projects we are working on together cannot move forward."" She says that means ""project planning meetings are being delayed, as well as permit applications for upcoming work.""  Stimpert studies bioacoustics — ""acoustic behavior and effects of noise on marine species,"" she explains — in waters off of California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Alaska and Antarctica. She says that in some cases, the shutdown means she may have to reorganize some travel or wait to start a phase of research until collaborators can work. In other areas, it might have more serious implications: ""We might miss an opportunity to deploy an instrument, which makes us miss collecting an entire season of data."" And Stimpert says that if she or her collaborators have future federal funding delays, it could mean that ""I can't purchase an instrument that I need, but might (and I am not alone in this) mean my other funding runs out and I can no longer fund my position, making me lose my benefits.""Christopher Horvat, a climate scientist at Brown University, tells NPR, ""I'm a postdoc, and while I am in a lucky position to have a reasonably-paying fellowship, the loss of support sucks away my ability to continue research."" His funding comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via a contractor, and NOAA is closed during the shutdown.""Already, the high relative cost of travel for research my means I must float significant amounts of money relative to my salary on credit cards,"" he says. ""With the shutdown, reimbursements for research and travel expenditures are not being paid.""Horvat researches the Arctic climate system --""aspects of its sea ice, ocean and ecology emerging as a result of the last century of rapid change, like massive under-ice phytoplankton blooms or rapid sea ice breakup events. I also do kayak-based field research in the high Arctic where we use drones to map changes to the sea ice in Arctic waterways.""He says his employer has provided two options: ""(1) be furloughed, or (2) have subsequent pay periods at half our typical rates, with the hope that at the conclusion of the shutdown we will get back pay accounting for the drop in pay. ""As a contractor, in the case of a furlough I would not be paid for the time I did not work and so I would likely go on unemployment. I do not know how long option (2) will last, but I assume it is for at least the next few weeks before a forced furlough happens. While earning half rates seems like the best option, unemployment would pay a similar wage and have more certainty, while prolonging my appointment."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/683662691/where-does-illegal-immigration-mostly-occur-heres-what-the-data-tell-us","Most undocumented immigrants didn't enter this country through Tijuana, where news cameras have captured images of thousands of immigrants seeking refuge during recent months. And they didn't enter near the border town of McAllen, Texas, which the president visited Thursday during the 20th day of a partial government shutdown fought over constructing additional barriers on the Southern border.When it comes to people in the country without proper documentation, the majority of them didn't cross the Mexican border at all. Most of them came to the United States legally — but then don't leave.About 700,000 travelers to the United States overstayed their visas in fiscal 2017, the most recent year for which the Department of Homeland Security has published figures. DHS estimated that, as of Sept. 30, 2017, the end of that fiscal year, more than 600,000 of those travelers were still in the U.S. During that same year, there were just 300,000 apprehensions along the Southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection — the lowest number since 1971. Don't see the graphic above? Click here.Visa overstays have outnumbered people who enter the country illegally at the Southern border every year since 2007, according to a report by the Center for Migration Studies. The report's authors estimate that the number of total visa overstays was 600,000 more than the total number of border crossers and that in 2014, visa overstays accounted for two-thirds of all new undocumented immigrants. The Southern borderImmigrants traveling through Mexico, of course, take up much of the public's attention on the issue of illegal immigration. And they do account for almost all people apprehended by CBP, which includes the Border Patrol. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement largely works in the interior of the country.)Those caught by the U.S. government can apply for asylum if they can claim a credible fear that their lives would be in danger by returning to their home countries; some immigrants, in fact, turn themselves in to federal agents to do so. Apprehensions of people attempting to cross the border illegally, however, far outnumber the number of people requesting asylum at the border.The agency catches the highest number of undocumented migrants in the Rio Grande Valley sector of south Texas. This includes McAllen, where the president visited on Thursday.In fiscal 2018, CBP apprehended 162,000 people in the Rio Grande Valley. None of the eight other Border Patrol sectors on the Southern border had even half of that activity.Don't see the graphic above? Click here.But another area saw apprehensions quickly rise during recent months: the El Paso sector. In the last fiscal year, 8 percent of all apprehensions came from this area, which consists of New Mexico and a small portion of West Texas, including the city of El Paso. But in October and November of 2018 — as apprehensions in general ticked up — that area's share doubled. The majority of that growth in the El Paso area has been from apprehensions of what CBP calls ""family units."" During those two months, the agency reported that almost three-quarters of all people caught there were traveling with family members.""What we've been seeing over the past few months is a dramatic increase in families and kids,"" Andrew Meehan, CBP's assistant commissioner for public affairs, told NPR. ""You have Border Patrol stations that are largely at capacity and are not equipped to handle the large surge of families and kids that have approached our border.""Don't see the graphic above? Click here.It is unclear how many of these migrants applied for asylum after arriving in the U.S. — but the total number of asylum cases has been increasing as well.""A growing percentage of border crossers in recent years have originated in the Northern Triangle states of Central America,"" wrote Robert Warren and Donald Kerwin of the Center for Migration Studies. ""These migrants are fleeing pervasive violence, persecution and poverty, and a large number do not seek to evade arrest, but present themselves to border officials and request political asylum. Many are de facto refugees, not illegal border crossers,"" the authors wrote.In 2017, the Border Patrol employed more than 19,000 agents, almost double the number in fiscal 2003. And the agency's budget grew from $263 million in 1990 to more $3.8 billion in 2016, according to the American Immigration Council. The budget for Customs and Border Protection — which includes the Border Patrol — has grown from $5.9 billion in 2003 to $13.2 billion in 2016.At the same time, apprehensions at the Southern border have declined — from a high of more than 1.6 million in 2000 to just over 300,000 in 2017. Does the wall deter crossings?Despite consistently high apprehensions in sectors that do contain fencing, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said at the White House on Wednesday that ""everywhere we put up a wall, illegal immigration has been reduced 90 to 95 percent."" Yet, CBP data shows that the number of people that agents have caught has decreased across the board — not just in areas where the government constructed barriers. Both the El Paso and Rio Grande sectors have physical barriers in place to prevent illegal crossings into the United States. Pedestrian fencing stretches to both sides of the city of El Paso in West Texas, with vehicle barriers along much of the rest of the New Mexico border. In south Texas, pedestrian fencing dots the area around McAllen and expands most of the way from there to the Gulf of Mexico.  The Tucson sector, which covers most of Arizona and is almost completely blocked by vehicle and pedestrian fencing, has seen a recent increase in apprehensions. In fiscal 2018, CBP caught about 52,000 people there, including an estimated 5,000 unaccompanied minors.The sector of the Southwestern border with the fewest apprehensions, on the other hand, has almost no fencing. The Big Bend sector, starting in West Texas and extending about halfway down the state, is the largest individual sector guarded by CBP. The rough terrain of the mountain ranges and the Chihuahuan Desert make it a difficult place to cross. In fiscal 2018, CBP apprehended just 8,000 people there. Joel Rose contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/10/677745758/hurdles-remain-as-the-final-countdown-begins-for-the-2020-census","Updated Jan. 18 at 6:12 p.m. ETThe last stretch before the start of the 2020 census is upon us.The once-a-decade, national head count is scheduled to kick off next January. Census workers start in the village of Toksook Bay and other parts of rural Alaska when the ground there is frozen enough for door-to-door visits. Then, beginning in March 2020, the U.S. government's most expansive peacetime operation rolls out to households in the rest of the country.The data collected will be used for a major reset in political power and federal funding through 2030. Each state's share of representatives in Congress, as well as votes in the Electoral College, will be determined for the next decade by the new population counts. Those counts are also used to distribute more than $880 billion a year in federal funds for Medicare, schools and other public services, according to the latest estimate by The George Washington Institute of Public Policy.But before the government can carry out its constitutional mandate to count every person living in the country, it has plenty of hurdles to clear in 2019. Here are five of the most pressing questions surrounding the upcoming census.1. Will there be enough money for the census?The Census Bureau is closed because of the government shutdown, but work for the 2020 census is continuing for now thanks to carryover funding from the 2018 omnibus spending bill President Trump signed in March. The bureau estimates that funding can last at least through March or into April with ""no change to the schedule, cost, or scale"" of the 2020 head count, according to a statement from the bureau's public information office.In case the shutdown lasts longer — as Trump has threatened — the Census Bureau has started looking into ways to ""extend the length of the funds without notable programmatic slowdowns,"" the agency's statement says.Next year's head count is expected to be the most expensive in U.S. history. The Census Bureau estimates it will cost a total of $15.6 billion. Spending for the census is already ramping up as the bureau begins opening temporary local offices around the country this month and prepares to launch a national advertising campaign in January 2020.Last year, Congress significantly boosted funding for the agency, reversing years of lawmakers not matching the funding levels agency officials said they would need. Past funding uncertainty has forced the bureau to cancel some field tests for the census, including ones designed to work out the logistics of counting rural areas and collecting Spanish-language responses.Now, census advocates are watching to see if the census gets caught in a prolonged funding stalemate with the partial federal government shutdown – a scenario that could impact the hiring of census workers, advertising plans and IT systems preparations for the first U.S. census to allow all households to respond online.2. What will happen to plans to add a citizenship question?The Trump administration is fighting seven lawsuits over a hotly contested question it added to the 2020 census last year – ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""While the administration insists the Justice Department wants responses to the question to help protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities, more than two dozen states and cities, plus other critics, worry the question will discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the census.In the two lead lawsuits in New York, a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to stop its plan to add the question.The legal battle is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court this year. Whether the question stays or goes has to be finalized by June, the Census Bureau says, so that printing the paper questionnaires can be completed without disrupting the tight deadlines leading up to 2020.As the issue winds its way through the courts, some Democrats in Congress are exploring other ways to stop the administration's plans. One possibility is including language in a spending bill that would defund the question.""Whether through the appropriations process, the courts, or elsewhere, we must act to make sure an untested citizenship question is not on the 2020 Census,"" says Democratic Rep. José Serrano of New York — who now chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the census — in a written statement.Another front to watch is the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Its newly-named chair, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, says he plans to investigate why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, approved adding the question.""Secretary Ross told Congress it was all the Justice Department's idea when evidence indicates he orchestrated the whole thing,"" Cummings says in a written statement. ""We will get to the bottom of this issue.""Testimony by Ross at a congressional hearing, as well as any internal documents lawmakers uncover, could be used against the Trump administration in the citizenship question lawsuits. ""We'll be watching closely and listening intently to any subsequent representations that Ross makes to the public,"" says Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is representing plaintiffs in one of the California-based lawsuits.So far, Ross has avoided having to sit for questioning under oath by the plaintiffs' attorneys. The Supreme Court was planning to weigh in on whether Ross can be deposed for the lawsuits, but the justices cancelled oral arguments after the ruling by the federal judge in New York neutralized the issue.If the citizenship question does stay on the 2020 census forms, the responses collected could dramatically reshape the political maps of some states and local communities. According to a Federal Register notice submitted by the Commerce Department in December, the Census Bureau is planning to ask state and local officials in charge of redistricting whether they want citizenship data from the 2020 census. That data, if it becomes available, could be used to redraw voting districts based on the number of U.S. citizens rather than on all residents regardless of citizenship.3. Is the online U.S. census prepared for cybersecurity threats?To cut down on costs and keep up with the digital age we're living in, the Census Bureau is preparing to allow all households to submit their 2020 census responses through the internet. The new convenience, however, has raised questions about whether the Census Bureau is prepared for the potential risk to people's privacy.""Because the 2020 Census involves collecting personal information from over a hundred million households across the country, it will be important that the Bureau addresses system security weaknesses in a timely manner and ensures that risks are at an acceptable level before systems are deployed,"" investigators at the Government Accountability Office wrote in a recent report.Last June, the Census Bureau identified close to 3,100 security weaknesses in the IT systems for the 2020 census, according to the report.The bureau is preparing for potential problem scenarios, including denial-of-service attacks that crash the online questionnaire, fake websites impersonating the Census Bureau, and hacking of phones, laptops and other electronic devices used by the bureau's employees. Officials, however, say they're not planning to go into the details with the public.""We have not shared our plans for cybersecurity with the public intentionally to not give the opposing team, adversaries wanting to discredit the federal government, an advantage,"" the Census Bureau's chief information officer, Kevin Smith, wrote in a blog post in August.4. Can the Census Bureau hire enough census workers?For the last census in 2010, the U.S. government hired about 635,000 temporary workers to collect responses in person from households that did not complete or mail back a census form. Help will be wanted again in 2020, but the low unemployment rate is putting pressure on the Census Bureau's recruiting efforts.Using iPhones to enter and submit people's information online is expected to help census workers be more productive in the field. Still, the bureau is planning to launch an advertising campaign targeting not only unemployed workers but also those who are already working and have evenings and weekends free.""If you're paying any attention to the news, teachers are complaining about needing to make more money,"" Albert Fontenot, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, said during a public meeting in October. ""Teachers love to do the census. It's a great opportunity for them to partake in democracy and be able to tell their students about what they do.""5. Will the census undercount communities of color and other hard-to-count populations?The Census Bureau is charged with counting every person living in the U.S. every 10 years. But some populations have been more difficult to tally up accurately than others.In 2010, the bureau over-counted white people who did not identify as Hispanic, while net undercounting close to 2.1 percent of black residents and 1.5 percent of Latino residents — or more than 1.5 million people in total — according to estimates from a Census Bureau study.The bureau is trying to overcome this challenge of reaching ""hard-to-count"" groups, in part, by increasing the number of languages that responses can be submitted in and starting to hire workers to coordinate outreach efforts with local organizations earlier than it did for the 2010 census.Still, the NAACP is leading a lawsuit alleging that the Census Bureau's ""deficient"" preparations for 2020 risk a ""massive undercount"" of communities of color, according to its complaint. The Trump administration has asked a federal judge in Maryland to dismiss the case.Critics of the citizenship question are concerned that asking about U.S. citizenship status will jeopardize the accuracy of the information collected, especially data about many hard-to-count populations.Beginning in June, the bureau is planning to conduct the first-ever field test of a 2020 census form with the citizenship question. Results, officials say, will inform decisions on whether to hire more census workers and adapt the 2020 census marketing campaign due to any negative response to the question.Some census advocates are worried that a citizenship question would deter community groups from helping to promote the census.""The @uscensusbureau should be praying for these [citizenship question] lawsuits to succeed. They cannot expect that the 'trusted messengers' like @NALEO will do their job for them!"" wrote Arturo Vargas, the CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, in a tweet in September.Last November, an email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits alarmed some community groups preparing to drum up public interest in the census.Federal law prohibits the release of an individual's census responses until 72 years after the data are collected. But concerns about confidentiality surfaced after the internal email revealed a Justice Department discussion about the possibility of ""renewed debate"" over whether the Patriot Act, passed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, could force individuals' confidential census responses to be released earlier."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683519210/air-travelers-and-workers-may-feel-government-shutdown-effects","Jacinda says she has ""no idea"" what her family will do if the government shutdown continues past January. Her husband's last paycheck was Dec. 28 and, like many federal workers, he's unlikely to get his next one at the end of this week. He may not get the one after that, due at the end of January, either. ""Our rent is due, the electric bill is due, our cellphones are now past due,"" she says.Her husband is a TSA officer in Portland, Ore., but he's not speaking publicly because the Transportation Security Administration forbids personnel to do so. ""We are a paycheck-to-paycheck family,"" Jacinda, 36, says. We're not using her last name because she fears he could be fired.Jacinda says she has paid some of her rent — less than half — so she can save what she can for food and gas. After all, she says, ""my husband has to drive to work every day.""The government shutdown is increasingly straining employees who are essential to keeping the nation's aviation system safe and running. Many at the TSA, such as Jacinda's family, don't have savings to fall back on and wonder how they'll make ends meet if they don't get paychecks or backpay soon.Jacinda, who wrote into NPR, says the shutdown is putting a lot of pressure on her family. Her husband has to go to work and he's not getting a paycheck, ""which is ridiculous,"" she says. Even more ridiculous, Jacinda says, is that he came home the other day with instructions on how to file for unemployment while he's still working 40 hours a week.Her husband's salary recently was bumped up to $40,000 a year, Jacinda says. ""We are not getting rich, but we could at least feel secure."" The couple has two kids — a 6-month-old girl and a boy who will soon be 4 years old. They were planning to buy a few presents and decorations to celebrate her son's birthday at the end of the month, but they can't do that now.She says three years ago, her husband's TSA job helped the family ""claw out of poverty,"" and she now fears the shutdown will set them back. ""I feel this sneaking anxiety that it all can be gone,"" she says. Her biggest concern is losing her home. ""I'm scared and I'm trying to be OK,"" she says as she fights back tears. ""I can't be sad every day for my kids and I can't be stressed out because it affects how I parent.""Christine Vitel is a single mom who has worked for the TSA at Chicago's O'Hare airport for more than 16 years. With a son in college, she says she's trying to figure out how she will pay his tuition. On top of that, she just bought a house. ""I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage,"" she says.Vitel says she worked very hard to improve her credit so she could buy the house but now fears losing it.""I'm going to either lose [my house] or my credit rating is going to go way down and my interest rate is going to go up,"" she says.""A lot of the officers, they live paycheck to paycheck,"" says Janis Casey, president of the Chicago local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSA employees. She notes that they are among the lowest-paid federal government employees, averaging about $36,000 to $43,000 per year, with starting pay only in the mid-20s.Air travel as a whole also is feeling the pinch of the partial government shutdown. New aircraft are not being inspected and are not being certified to fly. Security screeners — such as Jacinda's husband and Vitel — and other employees deemed essential are working but are not being paid. And for these federal workers and their families, the situation could get dire rather quickly.It's not much better for higher-paid essential government workers either, such as air traffic controllers.""It's a very high-stress job, and you need to be on your game at all times.""A toll on workers' psycheMick Devine is with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association in Boston.  He says the shutdown is forcing controllers to make tough financial decisions and it weighs on them heavily. ""There is a concern that as this goes on, the human factors aspect of the shutdown will take a toll on the psyche and concentration level of our members,"" he says. He adds that they do the best job that they can each and every day.Another concern is that nearly 20 percent of the FAA's 10,000 air traffic controllers are eligible to retire, and union leaders say some might do that rather than continue to work during the shutdown.There also are concerns that many of the nation's 51,000 TSA employees will eventually quit and find work elsewhere rather than continue to work without pay. Already, a greater number than usual are calling in sick.And only some FAA safety inspectors are working.Capt. Dennis Tajer, a pilot for American Airlines and a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, says many planes are not being inspected and pilot training is not being certified.  ""We're starting to see the beginning tremors of a situation that will only get worse over time,"" he says. Right now he says air travel is able to maintain a margin of safety and security, ""but every day another player is pulled off the field and it comes some point where the game cannot be played properly.""At O'Hare, air travelers such as Erica Westgard of Indialantic, Fla., have expressed concerns.""If TSA is affected and lines do get longer, work could get sloppier,"" she says, ""and that's always a concern for safety.""But Ray Ortiz, who just arrived on a business trip from New York, says he hasn't seen any ill effects from the shutdown yet.""I actually showed up early because I thought the wait times might be very long, but it was actually really short today,"" he says.Nonetheless, Ortiz worries that if the shutdown continues, there could be a tipping point where safety and security could be compromised.""We have enough things to worry about when we're traveling, and to fear for our security, or even worse, our lives,"" he says. ""That puts us in a predicament that I don't think any of us want to be in.""On week three of the shutdown, Jacinda is angry. ""It's not fair that our livelihood is on the line"" because President Trump wants to make a point, she says. ""You shouldn't play with people's lives,"" she says. And the president's address to the nation on Tuesday evening to make his case for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico only made her angrier, she says. ""I don't remember agreeing to sign my family up to be part of the sacrifice he's willing to make for his cause,"" she says. All she wants, she says, is for her husband to get paid, ""so we can take care of our family."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683474397/7-takeaways-from-president-trumps-oval-office-address","President Trump delivered the first Oval Office address of his presidency Tuesday night — and it came in the midst of a protracted partial government shutdown.There were a lot of questions going into the address, but there were at least as many afterward — especially, and most importantly: What now?So what did we learn from the president's address and the rare Democratic response? Here are seven insights:1. We are no closer to the shutdown being overTrump tried to insist that he had already compromised with Democrats, saying he had moved from a concrete wall to barrier made of steel slats. But Democrats see that as no compromise. Remarkably, he neither offered anything else (like, say, bringing some clarity to the situation of the so-called DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children) nor leveled any threat, like that he could declare a national emergency.Not offering a compromise or leveling a threat is particularly curious given the point of Oval Office addresses during a tragedy or a ""crisis"" is to affect some sort of outcome. Congressional leaders are again set to return to the White House on Wednesday for resumed negotiations, but don't expect much to come of that. The president on Thursday is headed to the Southern border, where he's expected to continue making the case for a physical barrier.2. Trump's dark worldview holdsThe president's convention acceptance speech (""the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation"") and his inauguration speech (""American carnage"") were dark visions of the country. And, once again, when speaking to the whole country in a big moment, the president laid out a dark vision.""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?"" Trump said, pushing for increased border security funding. Trump's view of immigration and immigrants as causing exceptional crime and violence is echoed in conservative media, but is not borne out by facts or data.3. The president's real audience: wavering congressional RepublicansWhile Trump was trying to say he speaks for everyone, his real audience may have been congressional Republicans who are starting to feel the political pressure as the partial shutdown drags on. Three Senate Republicans have said they want the government back open, and Vice President Pence was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday meeting with House Republicans.4. Instead of being empathetic to federal workers, he insisted this is what they wantIf the partial shutdown continues through the end of the week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going to miss their first paycheck since the stalemate began in late December. So, the pain is going to be felt more strongly soon.But Trump did not speak directly to those workers or show any degree of empathy for them. Instead, he argued, ""This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need.""5. Trump did OK with the ""optics,"" but that's not the most important thingStyle is always the thing a lot of people talk about first when looking at a presidential address. And there are few people who don't like the president who will believe he did a good job in any way.But there were a lot of questions about how this president would do in an Oval Office address, a venue a lot of past presidents have struggled in. Trump was able to make and read his argument without much of a hitch, though it was a very dark speech. (In a tweet late Tuesday, the president seemed to almost congratulate himself, saying to his millions of followers: ""Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!"") But appearances matter far less than the substance, and Tuesday night's address seemed to move the substantive debate — over a Southern border wall and border security more broadly — forward very little.6. Democrats are focused on ending the shutdown, while Trump is focused on the wallIt's rare that the opposition party would deliver a response to an Oval Office address. That's usually left to State of the Union addresses. But Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., were allotted time after the president spoke. They noted that they are in favor of border security, but they made it clear that they're focused on ending the partial shutdown.""The fact is,"" Pelosi said, ""President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation – many of them veterans."" Schumer ended the address imploring Trump to ""end this shutdown now.""7. Is a national emergency declaration the only way out? It's unclear what happens next, with Trump and Democrats living in different universes when it comes to immigration and border security. The president opted not to threaten or declare a national emergency Tuesday night, but could it — with all of its risks – be the only play the president has left?That would entail him signing legislation to fund the Cabinet departments and agencies that are closed and it would give him the chance to tell his base that at least he fought as hard as he could to get Congress to act. Of course, such a declaration would end up being challenged in the courts and may be why the president chose not to go there Tuesday.NPR's Mara Liasson contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683205814/fact-check-trumps-oval-office-pitch-for-a-border-wall","President Trump used his first prime-time address from the Oval Office to make the case for his controversial border wall. The president's demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding — and Democrats' opposition — has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government.Here we check some of the arguments made by the president and top Democrats in their response.Claim 1: Humanitarian and security crisis""There is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our Southern border.""Fact check: Illegal border crossings in the most recent fiscal year (ending in September 2018) were actually lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and much lower than at their peak around 2000. The number of unauthorized border crossers is also dwarfed by the number of people who overstay their visas. But there has been a spike in crossings in the past few months, topping 60,000 in both October and November. And while illegal crossings are still well below the levels of a generation ago, the makeup of the traffic has changed. There are now many more children and families from Central America, who present different challenges than single adults from Mexico.Many of the Central American migrants are seeking asylum, citing a fear of violence or persecution back home. While the majority of these asylum claims are ultimately rejected, assessing them can take months or years. In the past, asylum-seekers were typically released into the U.S. during this period, a practice the Trump administration criticizes as ""catch and release."" The administration wants to detain migrants while their asylum claims are adjudicated. This has led to overcrowded detention centers. And under a court order, young migrants generally cannot be detained for more than about 20 days. (The administration tried to get around that last year with its ill-fated and short-lived family separation policy, to allow indefinite detention of adults while children were turned over to the Health and Human Services Department or resettled with family members.) Importantly, most asylum-seekers turn themselves in to U.S. authorities, which they could do with or without a border wall.Claim 2: Driving down jobs and wages""All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.""Fact check: The effect of illegal immigration on wages has been studied extensively, and conclusions vary quite a bit. Because of the underground nature of the problem, hard evidence can be hard to come by. Some evidence exists that because illegal immigrants tend to be low-skilled, they compete with native-born workers and can lower wages for those at the bottom of the income scale. But they can also reduce the cost of production in some industries, which can mean lower prices for Americans as a whole. Indeed, many employers complain that in today's tight labor market, the shortage of immigrant labor is driving up their costs. As for the president's claim that illegal immigrants drain public resources, many studies have concluded that while illegal immigrants may drive up the cost of government services in some places, they also make up for it by paying taxes.Claim 3: ICE arrests""In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged [with] or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country."" Fact check: The president is right about the total number of arrests of immigrants with criminal records that ICE has arrested over the past two years. But that number alone is misleading, because many of those of immigrants have very likely committed immigration-related offenses rather than violent crimes as the president is suggesting.Trump has frequently pointed to sympathetic crime victims to justify his crackdown on illegal immigration. But experts say the president's rhetoric overstates the threat posed by immigrants, who tend to commit crime at lower rates than people who are born in the United States — including murder and other violent crimes.Claim 4: Illegal drugs""Our Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs. ... My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem.""Fact check: According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs imported to the U.S. from Mexico are smuggled through legal ports of entry. Only a small fraction comes through parts of the border that would be covered by a wall.Claim 5: Wall paid for by Mexico""The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.""The president is referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was signed by the leaders of the three countries on Nov. 30, 2018. In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the new pact would usher in huge economic benefits, essentially making up for the cost of the wall. The problem with that is twofold: First, the agreement has to be approved by Congress, and that's not a sure thing, so presumptions about how much money it will bring in are premature. Second, many economists say the new agreement is at best a modest reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement and are skeptical about its economic benefits. Typical was Phil Levy of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, who wrote that ""there is very little in the USMCA to suggest it will create an economic growth spurt in the United States.""Claim 6: $5.7 billion request""Law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security."" Fact check: The administration's latest request — presented to lawmakers over the weekend — seeks $5.7 billion for 234 miles of ""new physical barrier,"" which works out to about $24 million per mile. That's a shift from December, when Homeland Security said it wanted $5.7 billion to secure 215 miles of border but only 100 miles of that was expected to be a new barrier. The rest would go to restoring existing walls and fences. The switch from concrete to steel was not made at the request of Democrats.In addition, the administration is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars for additional border guards, immigration judges, detention beds and ""to ensure the well-being of those taken into custody.""Claim: Democrats and the president want border securitySenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: ""Make no mistake. Democrats and the president both want stronger border security. However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.""Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned the president's proposed border wall as costly, ineffective and immoral. ""We're not doing a wall,"" Pelosi said. ""A wall is an immorality between countries."" Though, as the president noted, congressional Democrats including Schumer have at times supported border barriers in the past. Nearly 700 miles of wall and fencing have already been built along the U.S. border with Mexico since 2006. Some have argued that where walls make sense, they have already been built and where they haven't been built, they don't make sense. Each party is seeking to blame the other for the partial government shutdown. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos Poll, 51 percent blame the president, an increase of 4 points from a similar poll just before Christmas. The same poll found only about 4 in 10 Americans support the idea of additional fencing along the border, and support has fallen since 2015. Among Republicans, however, support for the wall is stronger, with 77 percent supporting additional fencing and 54 percent approving of a shutdown as a means to that end."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683003723/watch-live-trump-gives-first-oval-office-speech-as-partial-shutdown-continues","Updated at 11:27 p.m. ETPresident Trump made his case to the American people Tuesday night for why a massive wall along the Mexican border is necessary, using his first Oval Office address to outline his conditions for ending the 18-day-and-counting partial government shutdown. ""This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,"" Trump said, explaining why his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall and for additional border security measures is necessary. ""The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. ... The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government,"" the president said. Trump's address Tuesday night seemed, at least in part, a way to reassure nervous Republicans about the political cost of the shutdown, some of whom may be wavering as more impacts from the partial closure of the government ripple across the country. Trump and Vice President Pence will meet with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, and on Thursday Trump will visit the border to continue his media blitz. But in the nearly three-week-long shutdown, there still is no clear path to a resolution anytime soon, as both Trump and Democratic congressional leaders in their rebuttal offered nothing new beyond the arguments they've been making since last month.Unlike at his campaign rallies, Trump didn't begin his Oval Office address with his push for a wall. Instead, he first outlined what he says is an urgent need to address a growing number of migrants trying to cross the border and to address drugs coming across illegally. ""Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system,"" Trump said. Trump also claimed that the ""Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs"" and that it was necessary to ""stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers."" However, an NPR fact check found that according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry and only a small fraction comes through parts of the Southern border that would be impacted by a wall. Trump also tried to make an emotional plea, pointing as he often has to crimes and slayings committed by undocumented immigrants as another reason stricter border security is necessary. ""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?"" Trump asked, framing his argument as ""a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.""However, studies show undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.  The Trump administration has tried to establish a link between terrorism and the situation at the Southern border, and on Tuesday night Trump said a ""barrier is absolutely critical to national security."" But he and his allies have often exaggerated the threat or simply used inaccurate or misleading statistics to do so. While there has been a spike in Southern border crossings in the past few months — largely children and families fleeing violence in Central America — overall illegal crossings are lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and far lower than their peak around 2000. Trump also tried to make the argument that the wall would be paid for, indirectly, by Mexico thanks to a new trade deal he has negotiated to replace NAFTA. However, that new deal has not been ratified by Congress, and as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported, there's no guarantee the economic gains could pay for the wall and the White House has not explained its math to back up that claim. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also claimed last week that Customs and Border Protection picked up almost 4,000 suspected terrorists along the Southern border, but NBC News found those stops have largely been made at airports. During the first half of fiscal year 2018, CBP stopped just six immigrants at ports of entry on the Southern border who were on a federal terrorist watchlist, NBC also found. Trump asked for more funding for ""cutting age technology,"" more Border Patrol agents (who are currently working but not being paid since the Department of Homeland Security is subject to the partial shutdown) and for more immigration judges. The president also claimed that ""at the request of Democrats"" any wall would be a steel barrier. However, that has not been a condition from Democrats. Rather, after long pushing for a concrete wall, Trump recently shifted to talking about using steel slats to build a barrier on the Southern border, hoping that might convince some Democrats, but it has not. Democrats have remained in staunch opposition to any contingencies on reopening the government, arguing their victories in the midterm elections and public polling have shown the country doesn't want a wall. In their response following Trump's address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump of trying to ""manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration."" ""The fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation — many of them veterans,"" Pelosi said. ""He promised to keep government shut down for 'months or years' — no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.""Pelosi also pushed back on Trump's claims, saying that ""the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge — a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.""Trump has said he won't sign any bill to reopen the government, about a quarter of which was shuttered on Dec. 22, unless Congress acquiesces to his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall — Trump's central campaign promise that received raucous applause at his rallies, albeit with the caveat that Mexico would pay for the barrier. Last month, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security and would gladly ""take the mantle."" However, since the partial shutdown became a reality, he has tried to shift the blame to Democrats. Tuesday night Schumer challenged Trump to reopen the government while continuing to negotiate on border security. ""We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy,"" the Senate minority leader said. ""We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.""Last week, House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate won't take it up — even though the Senate passed identical legislation last month before Trump reasserted his desire for billions in funding for a border wall. In a statement after the address, McConnell remained firmly behind Trump and sought to foist blame back on Democrats.""The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president,"" the Senate majority leader said. ""For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2019/01/08/683352340/the-ethical-calculus-behind-nprs-decision-to-air-a-presidential-speech","A listener wrote: ""What ethical calculus has been used to decide that NPR will broadcast POTUS live?""He was referring to President Trump's Oval Office address tonight, his first from that venue. It is expected to be on the topic of immigration and his demand, as part of the negotiations to end the partial government shutdown, for funding for some kind of barrier on the southwest border.The email was one of many my office received asking that NPR not broadcast the speech live, or that NPR do simultaneous fact-checking. The latter is not possible on the radio, of course, without talking over the president (it is possible online). But NPR plans to provide context before the speech and fact-checking afterwards. It also plans to broadcast live the Democratic response.For those who haven't followed the intense debate on the topic since the speech was announced Monday: The argument is essentially that broadcast (and cable) news organizations should abandon established protocol of covering presidential Oval Office speeches live because this particular president has a well-documented pattern of saying things that simply aren't true, including in making his case for his border wall. By carrying the speech live, the argument goes, NPR is giving the president a platform to spread misinformation in hopes of swaying public opinion and thus forcing Democrats in Congress to accept the wall funding. .There is recent precedent for some broadcasters to turn down a president's request for airtime: CBS, ABC and NBC did not carry President Obama's 2014 address on immigration. NPR carried that speech live, both on the air and online. I asked the newsroom about the decision to air tonight's speech.Terence Samuel, deputy managing editor, told me, ""The debate inside the newsroom pretty much echoed the debate outside the newsroom,"" as to whether NPR would be inappropriately handing over its platform.But, he said, ""to the extent that somebody telling lies will completely throw us off our game and we don't know how to responsibly cover this event, that is not a clear-eyed view of what we do and how we do it.""NPR, Samuel said, spends ""a lot of time making sure that people know the truth as best as we understand it, and fact-checking the president day in and day out has become a common feature. Because of the way he functions that has become an important feature."" Donald Trump ""did not invent the presidential untruth,"" he said, although ""we might be talking about a matter of volume or scale.""The idea that NPR should not air the speech live because of the past pattern, Samuel added, is ""making a calculation ahead of time about what the president is going to say,"" as well as ""pretending that we are not able to do a good job of telling our listeners what's true and what's not true, and also, making an assumption of what the listeners bring to the conversation.""That last part resonates with me. Yes, NPR could decide to cover the speech as it does many other statements from the president, that is, after the fact. It would first hear what he says and then report it, with all the context and fact checking needed. But I'm uncomfortable with the notion that underpins some of the emails I've gotten on this issue. The argument essentially is that some news consumers are not very bright and will believe anything they are told, even mistruths coming from a president known for them. News consumers — certainly in their role as voters — have a responsibility to arm themselves with the facts. One of journalism's key roles is to provide those facts, as NPR does. Constant untruths do add to the noise and make ferreting out facts harder. But this situation is in some ways an argument over form: Can a listener hear something from a politician and figure out whether it is true or false by continuing to take in reporting and analysis after the fact? I think most of them can. Of course, not every presidential announcement is the same. NPR largely does not air presidential campaign rallies live. But context is important. As Samuel told me, ""in the middle of a government shutdown over immigration, the key protagonist in the debate says he wants to speak to the American people. I don't understand the world in which we do not allow the public to hear the president in his words."" He added, ""He's the president of the United States, he has a platform and NPR didn't do that.""But NPR's imperative remains the same, he said: ""Keep chasing the truth and share it with listeners. It's not hard to cut through the arguments [over whether to air the speech live or not] and do the work.""I agree. NPR listeners are smart and if the after-the-fact reporting is as rigorous as Samuel says it will be, they will come away with accurate facts with which to make up their own minds about this issue."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/683275888/democrats-set-to-counter-trump-after-oval-office-address","Updated at 10:38 p.m. ETDemocrats again rejected President Trump's demand for a wall on the Southern border following an Oval Office address Tuesday night in which Trump insisted the wall is the only solution to an influx of migration from Mexico and Central America.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called Trump's decision to shut down the government over the wall ""just plain wrong"" in a televised response to the president's address. The speeches were part of an aggressive public relations campaign to win public support in the standoff over the 18-day partial government shutdown. Both speeches hewed closely to a set of familiar demands and talking points that have dominated the debate over the wall since before the shutdown began in late December. Trump insisted a wall is the only solution and Democrats refused to approve funding to build it. Schumer and Pelosi also repeated their request that the government be reopened now and immigration and border security legislation be negotiated later.""There is an obvious solution,"" Schumer said. ""Separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation — supported by Democrats and Republicans — to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.""But Trump had already flatly rejected that idea in the speech that preceded their remarks.""The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security,"" Trump said. ""The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.""Trump called his request for a wall a humanitarian necessity, arguing the wall would block criminals and other bad actors from entering the country. ""This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice,"" Trump said. ""This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.""But Pelosi and Schumer said they are willing to support increased border security that does not involve a physical barrier on the Southern border.""We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values: We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry,"" Pelosi said. ""We can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.""Negotiations over the spending impasse are expected to continue Wednesday when top Senate and House Democratic and Republican leaders are set to meet at the White House to discuss the shutdown, according to multiple congressional sources. Trump and Vice President Pence are also set to speak with Senate Republicans on Wednesday.The administration effort to rally Republicans began Tuesday night when Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and officials from the Office of Management and Budget briefed House Republicans. They discussed the security situation at the border and the administration's plans for handling the ongoing partial shutdown.The White House representatives assured Republicans that national parks will remain open and food stamps will continue to be paid through at least February via the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, according to several members who attended the meeting.Longtime Trump supporter Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said Pence in particular reassured members that the administration and Senate Republicans are committed to pursuing the border wall and encouraged them to stick together.""Sometimes you need the coach to come rah-rah the team in the locker room,"" Collins said. ""He did that very thoughtfully with facts.""House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., later told reporters that administration officials did not address the possibility that Trump might declare a state of emergency to build the wall without congressional approval. Trump's wall has transcended typical Washington bickering over policy goals to become a political battle over the central ideologies of both parties. Democrats insist the wall is immoral, and Trump says it is imperative.""Democrats and an increasing number of Republicans in Congress have repeatedly urged the President and Leader McConnell to end the Trump Shutdown and re-open the government while Congress debates the President's expensive and ineffective wall,"" Schumer and Pelosi said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Unfortunately, President Trump keeps rejecting the bipartisan House-passed bills.""Republican congressional leaders have largely backed Trump in his push for the wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., dismissed Democrats Tuesday, blaming them for refusing to budge on the wall. ""Walls and barriers are not immoral. How silly,"" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""It is just political spite.""But Democrats say the stalemate over Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build the wall worsened over the weekend after the White House issued an updated list of demands that include 234 miles of new steel wall.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said a new batch of polls shows voters back Democrats or want a compromise now. He said the White House ignored those statistics when issuing the updated request. ""There was a very negative reaction by the American public,"" Hoyer said. ""[The administration] escalated their demands, not compromised their demands.""""McConnell has the ability to put these bills on the floor and say to the president of the United States, 'We're an independent branch; we're not the president's handmaids,' "" Hoyer added. ""We ought to pass bills that we believe are good policy.""Democrats are also working to sway some moderate and skeptical Republicans to abandon Trump on the wall. Last week, seven House Republicans voted with Democrats on a package of bills to reopen the government without an immediate resolution on the wall. Hoyer said he believes even more Republicans could join them later this week when Democrats begin holding votes on individual spending bills that were written last year by GOP committees.""These are bills that the Republican Senate passed 92-6,"" Hoyer said. ""There's an opportunity for every American to see who wants government open, and our responsibility is not to do what the president of the United States tells us to do."""

""We are looking at it very strongly,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday. ""We're looking at a national emergency, because we have a national emergency.""The president does have broad powers to act in a crisis situation, but those powers are not unlimited. And critics say Trump should be careful about invoking them in this instance. Here are five facts about Trump's emergency powers and the border wall.1. What are a president's emergency powers?There are dozens of laws that give the president special powers to act in an emergency. For example, in an emergency, the president is allowed to divert money to military construction projects, which could conceivably include the border wall.""Declaring the emergency is pretty easy,"" said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. ""There aren't a lot of legal limits on his ability to do that, frankly, even if there isn't a real emergency happening.""2. What say does Congress have?In the mid-1970s, Congress passed a law designed to provide some check on the president's power while also preserving flexibility to act in an emergency. The National Emergencies Act requires the president to notify Congress when an emergency is declared and to list the powers that are being invoked. The law requires the administration to provide regular updates to Congress, and allows lawmakers to terminate an emergency if both House and Senate vote to do so.3. Would congressional critics have recourse if Trump invoked emergency powers?Congress could reject the president's emergency declaration with a vote in both the House and Senate. But the Republican-controlled Senate seems unlikely to take that step. Instead, critics would very likely pursue a legal challenge.""I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, 'Where's the emergency?' "" Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told ABC.Goitein also cautioned that a resort to emergency powers in the current situation — in the midst of a standoff with lawmakers that has produced a partial government shutdown — could be considered an abuse of the president's power.""Emergency powers are intended to be used for emergencies, not to settle political disputes or to shortcut the political process,"" Goitein said.4. What is the emergency? The president has described the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border as both a humanitarian and national security crisis.""We have criminals coming in,"" Trump said Sunday. ""We have human traffickers coming in. We have drugs pouring in. We have things happening that you don't want to even know about.""The administration has also raised the specter of terrorists crossing the border, although many of these claims are overblown.What has happened on the border in recent months is a surge of Central American families seeking asylum. U.S. law and and court orders make it difficult to quickly deport these families or detain them for an extended period while their asylum claims are adjudicated.5. Would a wall help?Trump has insisted since the 2016 campaign that a physical barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico is the solution to what he sees as a crisis.""Walls work,"" the president wrote in a letter to lawmakers last week. ""That's why rich, powerful, and successful people build them around their homes. All Americans deserve the same protection.""Critics say the president's faith in a wall is misplaced.""It's a spectacularly bad idea, a complete waste of money,"" Smith told NPR. ""The only emergency we have on the border right now is people seeking asylum. And people seeking asylum are not trying to sneak in. They're turning themselves in and asking for a hearing.""NPR's Tamara Keith contributed to this report."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/07/682806059/white-house-adds-to-list-of-border-demands-as-shutdown-continues","Updated at 10:15 p.m. ETThe White House is planning a media blitz as President Trump pushes for a wall along the Southern border, which congressional Democrats have repeatedly rebuffed. This week's events involving the president come as a partial shutdown of the federal government drags into its third week with no apparent end in sight to the impasse.  Trump tweeted he will ""Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border"" on Tuesday night. It will be his first Oval Office address as president. The president is asking the television networks for 7-8 minutes of airtime, White House deputy chief of staff Bill Shine told NPR. After CNN and other outlets reported that all the major broadcast and cable networks will carry the Trump Oval Office address, the two leading Democrats on Capitol Hill demanded airtime to respond. ""Now that the television networks have decided to air the President's address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also announced Monday that Trump will travel to the border on Thursday ""to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis."" A wall on the Southern border with Mexico was Trump's hallmark campaign promise, and he is under pressure from his base and conservative commentators to deliver. But unable to obtain the funding he desired for it under a GOP-controlled Congress for the past two years, Trump last month said he would not sign any spending measure that did not contain sufficient funding for its construction. As a result of the standoff, about a quarter of the government shut down on Dec. 22. In 2019, the president is now hitting even more resistance from the newly installed Democratic House after a bruising midterm election cycle where Democrats won 40 House seats. It's an argument Trump and his allies have struggled to make since before they took office, but now they will try to use his bully pulpit to move public opinion. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll last month found that Americans — by a 21-point margin, 57 percent to 36 percent — wanted Trump to compromise on the wall instead of shutting down the government. Over two-thirds also said a wall shouldn't be an immediate priority for Congress.Weekend talks between Vice President Pence and congressional staffers to resolve the shutdown stalemate produced no breakthrough. Although Trump characterized the talks as ""productive,"" Democrats said there was no progress.Pence told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump was ""considering"" declaring a national emergency — the option is being ""looked at and examined"" — which could allow him to begin construction of the wall.Over the weekend, the White House did formalize its request for $5.7 billion to fund the border wall — a number Pence said Monday Trump will not retreat from. In a letter to lawmakers, the administration said that sum would pay for 234 miles of new barrier, at a cost of roughly $24 million per mile. The material used would now be steel, not concrete. The administration is also seeking hundreds of millions of dollars for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, detention beds, drug detection equipment and to address what it calls ""urgent humanitarian needs.""Pence argued that this approach represented a compromise on the White House's part, to go beyond just a wall and fund things Democrats want too. And he pushed back on criticism that this was just a way to appeal to Trump's ""base."" ""This isn't about [the] base. This is about the American people. This is about human trafficking; this is about a humanitarian crisis; this is about the flow of illegal drugs, illegal immigrants and the president's determination to address that issue with action and with resources,"" Pence said. Congressional Democrats are resisting the president's demand for wall funding. Trump ""is still demanding that American taxpayers pay at least $5.7 billion for his wall, which can't pass either chamber of Congress and of course Mexico is not paying for,"" Pelosi and Schumer also said in their statement Monday night. In an exercise in political messaging, the House is expected to begin voting Tuesday on a series of bills to reopen shuttered government agencies without additional money for a border barrier. Although a handful of Republican senators from swing states have expressed a desire to end the partial shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is adamant that the Senate will not vote on funding bills that don't have support from the president.Meanwhile, Senate Democrats say they will block even bringing up the start of legislative business this week. According to a senior Democratic aide, Schumer has notified the caucus he will vote against proceeding to the first bill of the session because Senate Republicans should instead be bringing up the Democratic-led House-passed bills to reopen the government. Friday is a scheduled payday for federal workers. If the impasse is not resolved by then, some 800,000 federal employees will miss being paid for the first time during the shutdown.If the standoff continues into the weekend, it will be the longest shutdown in recent history. It also has the potential to impact February food stamp benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Tax refund checks might have been disrupted too, but the White House said Monday the IRS will issue refunds during the shutdown.NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow and NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/06/681982396/a-guide-to-whos-who-in-house-leadership-for-the-116th-congress","The 116th Congress officially convened on Thursday with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years. And with Democrats' newfound power and Republicans' first time in the minority in nearly a decade, both parties saw a shuffle in their leadership teams.The Democratic leadership is a diverse slate, representing the record number of women and minorities their new caucus brings to Capitol Hill — Nancy Pelosi is resuming her place as the first female House speaker in history, with four other top positions either being filled by a woman or person of color.Republicans, however, have a leadership slate made up almost entirely of white males.Here's who you need to know in House leadership for both parties in the new Congress:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Pelosi made history as the first woman speaker ever when she took the gavel in 2007. Now, she retakes it again 12 years later, also making her the first speaker to reclaim the position in more than six decades.The San Francisco lawmaker has had her detractors, and many incoming freshmen in swing district campaigned on new leadership. On Thursday, fifteen in her caucus either voted for someone else or simply voted present. Still, those defections were much fewer than the 78-year-old feared last fall, showcasing her deal-making prowess that even many Republicans privately praise her for.She'll have to manage a caucus with diverging opinions and a vocal progressive wing, and have to grapple with a Republican Senate — something she didn't have to contend with during her first tenure. And, of course, plenty of clashes with President Trump also likely await. First on the agenda: trying to find an end to the partial government shutdown, with Pelosi pledging not to budge on funding for the wall on the southern border with Mexico that Trump says is a requirement before he will sign spending measures that would end the shutdown.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.The 79-year-old Hoyer also resumed the same post he had during Democrats' last turn in the majority, moving up from serving as minority whip for the past eight years.Pelosi and Hoyer have a had a long, sometimes testy, relationship. She hails from the legendary Maryland D'Alesandro political family, but that hasn't always endeared the two to each other, though they've denied any friction in recent years. Pelosi first beat Hoyer for whip in 2001 and she backed a challenger to Hoyer for majority leader when Democrats last took control in 2006.As The New York Times, recently wrote, the ""Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex"" as they're back in power together. But Hoyer has been a political survivor. He's the longest-serving current Democrat in the House, first elected in 1981. Hoyer is also the only white male in the top ranks of Democratic leadership.House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.The 78-year-old Clyburn is the highest-ranking African-American lawmaker in Congress. He served as whip when Democrats had the majority from 2007 until 2011, and then served as assistant House Democratic leader while Democrats were in the minority — a post Pelosi created especially for him when Hoyer and Clyburn were competing against each other after the 2010 elections. When Democrats were last in the majority, Clyburn served as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.It wasn't lost on many Democrats this year, though, that the trio at the top of the leadership ranks are all in their late seventies. And there's a proposal Pelsoi has backed to change that, term-limiting the top three spots to bring change over the next few years.Assistant Speaker, Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M.Lujan was awarded this No. 4 post after leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the past two cycles, resulting in a 40-seat gain in November and Democrats flipping control of the chamber. The position makes the 46-year-old the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, and part of a new generation of potential Democratic leaders once the top three leaders eventually step aside.Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.Jeffries narrowly defeated California Rep. Barbara Lee in caucus elections in November to claim the No. 5 leadership post. Some of Lee's allies claimed sexism and ageism in the vote, and criticized Jeffries as too centrist. Still, the victory set up the 48-year-old New York lawmaker, once called ""Brooklyn's Barack Obama,"" as a possible speaker of the House one day, which would make him the first black Speaker in history if that happens. And his addition means there's another African-American in Democratic leadership.Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos, D-Ill.Bustos has the tough task of protecting Democrats' newfound majority, but she brings credentials to the table unlike the others atop leadership — she represents a somewhat rural Illinois district that Trump narrowly carried, not unlike many of the seats Democrats will have to defend in 2020. A political protege of Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the centrist lawmaker even got four votes for speaker from incoming moderate Democratic freshmen.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.The 53-year-old California lawmaker would have far preferred the title of ""Speaker"" following Paul Ryan's retirement, but now he will have to learn how to maneuver being in the minority for the first time in eight years. McCarthy defeated House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio to win the top GOP post, and he should still expect to try to contend with a vocal conservative minority within the caucus — issues that plagued both of his predecessors. He's endeared himself to Trump (reportedly even keeping his favorite Starburst flavors on hand), and McCarthy's relationship with the president will be worth watching as Trump tries to win re-election and Republicans try to win back control of the House.House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.Scalise keeps the same role he's held since 2014, albeit this time for the minority party. The 53-year-old Louisiana lawmaker survived a near-fatal shooting attempt in June 2017 after a man opened fire during a congressional baseball game practice, and had continued rehabilitation. ""I had miracles. I had angels,"" he would later tell Politico about the assassination attempt. Scalise unanimously won the whip spot again when Republicans held leadership elections in November.Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.The 52-year-old Wyoming lawmaker assumes the No. 3 House GOP leadership post more than three decades after it was once held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. She's the highest-ranking woman in GOP leadership, and assumed the position after Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers decided not to seek another term in the party's leadership ranks. The political scion was first elected in 2016 and didn't make much noise during her first term, but now she could become one of the GOP's most visible faces, especially as Republicans try to counter a large number of new freshmen women Democrats.National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer, R-Minn.Emmer has to try to find a way to win back the 18 seats Republicans need to regain control of the House in 2020. He takes the position after serving as a deputy NRCC chair during the 2018 cycle. There could be divergent views within the caucus on how to do that, though. He's already gotten in a flap with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who said she'd help more GOP women win in primaries next year. After Emmer said it would be a ""mistake"" for Stefanik to try to intervene in primaries, she hit back, saying ""I wasn't asking for permission.""Also on the GOP leadership team are Republican Conference Secretary Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer, R-Ala."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/05/682374202/an-eerie-silence-where-federal-land-agency-workers-are-furloughed","The government shutdown has forced the partial or complete closure of some of the nation's most popular national parks and has furloughed thousands of federal land agency workers. This means all kinds of under-the-radar, yet critical, work has mostly stopped — from timber sales to wildfire prevention projects to the general upkeep and enforcement of laws on millions of acres of U.S. public lands. ""It's an eerie silence,"" says John Wentworth, a town councilman in Mammoth Lakes, Calif. ""The folks that are responsible for stewarding, maintaining and watching out for one of the great legacies of the United States are absent; they're gone."" Wentworth's town is completely surrounded — and largely dependent on — U.S. public lands, not the least of which its ski resort which operates on a U.S. Forest Service lease. The shutdown has coincided with one of his town's busiest seasons. Suddenly there's no one staffing area visitor centers or popular trailheads for snowshoeing, snowmobiling. There's no one to interact with visitors, enforce the rules and just manage the land.""It's kind of scary,"" Wentworth says. ""We don't know what to tell our visitors; we don't know how to be good hosts and stewards of these public lands because the federal presence is not there.""Wentworth's anxiety is familiar to communities across the West that promote themselves as gateways to massive amounts of U.S. public land. Much of that land is open to the public and to everything from natural resource extraction to outdoor recreation. The latter contributes billions to the U.S. economy, according to several recent studies.  So when your landlord is suddenly unreachable, almost everything is thrown into limbo. About half of all of California is federal land. Next door in Nevada it's more like 80 percent.""Sure, there are lots of citizens out there that will pick up trash, but the larger landscape planning issues, they're not being addressed,"" says Jaina Moan of the Nature Conservancy's Nevada chapter.In recent years, groups like the Nature Conservancy have played a big role in  large collaborative conservation and other development projects on federal land, such as programs that help improve rangeland for ranchers and reduce wildfire risk in national forests.   Moan's group can keep working on the side, but they can't access certain lands or the federal scientists who work on them. And big collaborative meetings about these projects are postponed indefinitely.  ""Like most of America, we hope that Congress and the president can resolve this soon because we need those government partnerships to work so that we can make sure that the conservation of our lands and waters can continue,"" Moan says. Westerners have been watching for years as funding for federal lands agencies and infrastructure has generally been on the decline. John Wentworth of the Mammoth Lakes town council says local governments like his have been trying to plan around this new reality, launching collaborative partnerships to pool resources and get some of the work done that was traditionally the federal government's responsibility.   ""So that if these spasms that come out of Washington due to unprecedented, existential, partisan craziness, we will have partnerships and working relationships in place to be able to mitigate these effects,"" he said.This summer, his town is partnering with the Forest Service to remove trash and staff area trailheads. But this latest shutdown, Wentworth says, happened so quick there was no time for even short term contingency plans."

Many federal employees working there are not on the job because of the shutdown. Calls to many of those federal offices, such as the Bureau of Land Management, result in outgoing voicemail messages that explain the office is closed because of ""the lapse in appropriations."" Nearby businesses sufferDown the street from the building complex, Nick Andurlakis has been running Nick's Cafe for 32 years. It's unabashedly Elvis-themed. The walls are adorned with photos of the King and album covers from his many hits. According to Andurlakis, the cafe's signature ""Fool's Gold"" sandwich was ordered and loved by the Elvis himself. Andurlakis normally sells a dozen of the peanut butter and bacon sandwiches each day, give or take. However, during a recent weekday afternoon, things were pretty quiet. ""I think we've lost, you know, maybe 20 percent of our business, 25 percent of our business,"" he says.He suspects the shutdown is partially responsible for his drop in customers but also says he thinks a lot of regulars could still be out for the holidays.Andurlakis says everybody suffers a little when the government shuts down. Still, he thinks these sorts of things usually happen for a reason, and he supports the push for more border security.""I'm the kind of guy that wants the government to be safe. I can understand where the president's coming from,"" he says, calling the shutdown a little political fistfight. Losing hours, and moraleColorado has more than 50,000 federal employees, many of whom are still on the job. But the state also has large numbers of federal departments affected by the partial shutdown, including about 6,500 workers with the Interior Department, 3,700 employees with the Agriculture Department, and 1,400 workers with the Department of Transportation. Fewer people in office parks means fewer people going out to lunch. Right across the street from the Federal Center in Lakewood, Tokyo Joe's fast food restaurant franchise manager Jolie Voss says 30 to 40 percent of her customer base are federal workers.""You kind of just get used to the same faces,"" Voss says. ""Bob from accounting is going to come in and get his white chicken bowl, so to not see those faces as often, you really notice.""As a franchise manager, she is expected to meet certain sales quotas and says business has been down thousands of dollars per week since the shutdown.""We have to start sending people home earlier, so people are losing hours. We're starting to waste more food product, which means we're spending more money on things we're just not gonna go through and in general just decreases the morale of my store,"" she says.She describes the shutdown as a squabble over petty affairs.The customers who were in the Tokyo Joe's during a recent weekday lunch rush could take solace in getting through the line faster. Jeda McKenney was sitting at a table outside. He's not a federal employee and says he's not paying much attention to the shutdown, though he might ""when stoplights stop working and they don't shovel my snow."" Those aren't federal obligations, but the sentiment reflects those of other Tokyo Joe's customers. They were not noticing effects of the shutdown in their daily lives.Still, the businesses federal workers use certainly are noticing.And while the furloughed workers are likely to get back pay, a sandwich shop is not going to get paid for a sandwich not eaten."

Patrick Riordan said at a news conference that as many as eight people were injured and taken to local hospitals in what he called an ""extensive"" and fiery wreck. At about 3:40 p.m. ET, a semitruck and a car traveling north along Interstate 75 near Gainesville collided, crashed through the center guardrails and smashed into a southbound semitruck and a church van carrying the children. The trucks burst into flames. Another car then slammed into the wreckage.The children ranged in age from 9- to 14-years-old and were traveling from Avoyelles Parish in central Louisiana, according to the highway patrol. In a Facebook post, Kevin Cox of the Louisiana district of the United Pentecostal Church International said the van was carrying members of its Marksville, La., congregation. Nine children were in the van at the time of the accident, as were three adult women. ""One of the ladies is pregnant and 'pretty banged up',"" Cox said. ""But doctors have been able to keep her and her unborn baby stabilized."" Among the children who died was the granddaughter of the congregation's pastor, Eric Descant. His wife was seriously injured in the crash. The four surviving children all sustained injuries but are expected to recover, Cox said. ""It's just beyond belief,"" Marksville Mayor John Lemoine told the Ocala Star-Banner. ""We are a small community with 6,500 people in town. ... It's affected everybody. That is what's so terrible about this."" The drivers of the two semitrucks, both adult males, were also killed. Officials say they don't yet know what caused the wreck and have opened an investigation. The driver of the truck involved in the first part of the accident had received multiple tickets in the past decade, including for speeding and driving an unsafe vehicle, according to the Associated Press.Video from the scene showed bodies and debris strewn across the roadway as thick smoke billowed from the burning wreck.""We kept seeing these little explosions and fire,"" Nicole Towarek, who witnessed the crash, told The Associated Press. ""The heat, it was insane.""Dozens of gallons of spilled diesel fuel fed a giant fire that damaged the roadway itself, according to the AP. Traffic on Friday morning was still backed up for miles, reports Grace King of member station WUFT. Officials announced Saturday that the highway has been repaired and is fully reopened.Riordan said the state highway patrol has notified the National Transportation Safety Board of the accident, although that agency is currently being affected by the prolonged partial government shutdown. NTSB investigators won't be able to start an examination of the crash until the government reopens, King reports.""It's unbelievable. Everybody is in shock,"" Maxine Doughty, a member of the Marksville congregation, told the Star-Banner. ""We had our Last Supper Sunday and the pastor said to live our lives like each day is the last day."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/04/682194516/profane-impeachment-call-from-freshman-democrat-gets-quick-rebuke-from-top-democ","Updated at 3:27 p.m. ETJust hours after Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., cautioned against moving toward impeaching President Trump, a freshman Democrat profanely vowed to remove the president.Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, one of the two women who made history for being sworn in as the first Muslim women in Congress, told supporters Thursday night: ""And when your son looks at you and says, 'Mama, look, you won. Bullies don't win,' and I said, 'Baby, they don't,' because we're gonna go in there, and we're  going to go in there and we're going to impeach the motherf*****.""The comments were captured on camera and quickly exposed the long-simmering debate inside the Democratic Party about the appropriate strategy to manage expectations for how the House will handle impeachment.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who would preside over any impeachment proceedings, was quick to bat down the comments in an interview on CNN on Friday morning. ""I don't like that language,"" Nadler said. ""More to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts and get the facts."" Pelosi also said she didn't like the use of the expletive, saying at a town hall on MSNBC, ""I probably have a generational reaction to it,"" but added, ""I'm not in the censorship business. I don't like that language; I wouldn't use that language, but I wouldn't establish language standards for my colleagues."" The speaker also tried to downplay the incident, saying, ""I don't think it's anything worse than what the president has said"" and ""I don't think we should make a big deal out of it.""Pelosi has repeatedly argued that the position of the caucus is to wait to see what special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation finds about any allegations of illegal behavior by the president.Pelosi, in an interview on NBC's Today show before she took the gavel, emphasized the need for evidence just hours before Tlaib's comments.""We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,"" she said. ""We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we'll just have to see how it comes.""The early fight over the issue illustrates the challenge Pelosi faces as she takes over as the leader of her party. Since Trump took office, there has been a loud and steady drumbeat for impeachment on the left, while those Democrats representing swing districts and states caution that igniting a firestorm over the issue only emboldens the president's base and could backfire heading into the 2020 presidential election.President Trump didn't mention Tlaib by name but questioned any suggestion he should be impeached on Twitter on Friday morning.Later, when asked about Tlaib's comments at a press conference in the Rose Garden, the president said ""You can't impeach somebody who is doing a great job.""He told reporters he didn't know the freshman Democrat, but said her comments were ""disgraceful.""  ""I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family,"" Trump said.The president also said the issue of impeachment came up in the meeting with congressional leaders on the shutdown and Pelosi told him ""we're not looking to impeach you.""House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy also pounced on the issue on Friday, calling on Pelosi as speaker to publicly denounce the language and arguing the remarks signaled Democrats aren't serious about bipartisanship.""How do you work with anybody if this is what they really have planned?"" McCarthy said to reporters at the Capitol, noting that both parties are still trying to find a compromise to end the partial government shutdown.But Tlaib stood her ground, tweeting with the hashtag ""unapologeticallyMe"" that ""I will always speak truth to power.""Pelosi's California colleague, Rep. Brad Sherman, quietly reintroduced the same articles of impeachment he filed in 2017 on the first day Democrats took control of the House. He called for hearings in a written statement, but also noted, ""I understand that a majority of our Democratic Caucus will want to wait until Special Counsel Robert Mueller completes his report, which I would hope will be issued in the next two to three months."""

Or might as well be.This is how elections work in this country — the presidential campaign cycle begins the year before the presidential election, and when it's a potentially large field, it pushes further and further back.And that is what's happening. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, got a lot of attention for her New Year's Eve video announcement that she had launched an exploratory bid for president.She is far from the only one making moves (or getting scrutiny — see Sanders, Bernie). Five candidates have already officially announced at least exploratory bids — Warren; former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro, who is set to formally announce his bid on Jan. 12; ex-Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who announced he was running in 2017; Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur; and Richard Ojeda, who ran for and lost a congressional seat in West Virginia.Billionaires, bewareLots of other candidates are expected to announce shortly, from sitting senators to current and former governors and mayors, as well as even possibly a billionaire or two.And that has Warren riled up.""Is this going to be a Democratic primary that truly is a grassroots movement that is funded by the grassroots, that's done with grassroots volunteers?"" Warren asked on MSNBC Wednesday night. ""Or is this going to be something that's just one more plaything that billionaires can buy?""Sure, President Trump is a billionaire, and an anti-billionaire message is fundamental to Warren's and Sanders' platforms of economic populism, but it's also an implicit shot at former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, the hedge fund manager turned climate change activist turned ""Need to Impeach"" Trump guy.Bloomberg got a big platform Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, where he was able to speak about climate change, an issue that would be fundamental in his possible run for president. He says he is going to decide by February whether he is running.Steyer, meanwhile, is headed to Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire early this year as part of his ""5 Rights"" tour. Warren is headed to Iowa this weekend, and she is showing that if either gets in, the water will be cold.GOP superPAC America Rising is already pointing out that Warren's comments could also be interpreted as a shot at any other Democratic candidate, like Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, potentially open to accepting help from superPACs set up by well-funded donors.(By the way, when a superPAC is sending out opposition research trying to fuel infighting in the opposite party, that smells like campaign season.)Sanders scrutiny comesIn 2016, Sanders benefited from outsider challenger status to Hillary Clinton. Yes, the deck was stacked against him with superdelegates, and, yes, the Democratic National Committee seemed to be limiting his exposure with the number of debates and when they were put on.But he received only the kind of scrutiny allotted to an upstart, maybe-he-can-actually-win challenger. Sure, his plans were analyzed for their price tag, but stories like this didn't really appear. The New York Times reported allegations of sexual harassment against 2016 campaign aides on Wednesday, including from former Sanders Latino outreach strategist Giulianna Di Lauro:Sanders was asked about the allegations Wednesday night on CNN. He apologized ""to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately"" and pledged ""if I run, we will do better the next time.""Asked whether he was aware of these kinds of allegations during his campaign, Sanders said, ""I was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.""In a year with a potentially very crowded field, and Sanders trying to maintain his coalition that is inevitably going to be picked through by lots of new candidates vying for the progressive mantle (See Warren, Elizabeth), stories and responses like this aren't helpful.(Note: Sanders isn't the only one who has had to deal with this. It was also revealed last month that Harris, who was California attorney general, also had a senior staffer at the California Department of Justice reach a $400,000 harassment financial settlement.)Other odds and ends"

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate jumped to 3.9 percent — the highest rate since August — as more people felt confident enough to quit their jobs and look for new ones.Major stock market indexes, which have seen massive swings in recent weeks,  rebounded Friday morning after the labor report was released. And they surged even more after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the central bank was in no hurry to raise interest rates further.""There is no preset path for policy and particularly with the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,"" Powell said at the American Economic Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 746 points, or about 3.3 percent, after plunging 660 points on Thursday.Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Private analysts had projected that jobs would grow by about 180,000 and that unemployment would stay at November's rate of 3.7 percent.Wage growth also picked up. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2 percent over the past 12 months — topping the 3.1 percent increase in November. Average earnings climbed to $27.48 an hour.Several sectors saw a pickup in hiring. Manufacturing jobs grew by 32,000 last month, construction climbed 38,000, retail was up nearly 24,000, health care  rose nearly 58,000, and leisure and hospitality jumped 55,000.In a signal of even more strength, 58,000 more jobs overall were added in the prior two months than previously reported. That boosted  job gains to an average 254,000 per month over the last three months.The markets have been turbulent amid concerns that the U.S. economy will be hurt by weakness in other countries.This week, Apple cut its revenue estimates by billions of dollars, primarily because of weaker-than-expected iPhone sales in China due to that country's economic slowdown. Apple CEO Tim Cook said China's growth was hurt by ""rising trade tensions with the United States.""The ripple effects from slower growth overseas could eventually hurt the U.S. economy, David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told NPR's Scott Horsley.""We're living in a world where if China seriously slows down, that's going to have a big effect on literally more than a hundred different economies,"" Dollar said. ""And then, of course, that affects the whole world.""Apple's downbeat announcement sent its stock plunging 10 percent Thursday, but it was up nearly 2 percent Friday morning. In the U.S., consumers did not hold back this holiday season, with sales up 5.1 percent over last year, according to a Mastercard report.Still, consumer confidence slid in December, the Conference Board said. ""Expectations regarding job prospects and business conditions weakened, but still suggest that the economy will continue expanding at a solid pace in the short-term,"" said Lynn Franco, a senior director at the Conference Board.Other indicators pointed to a slowdown in the manufacturing sector. The ISM manufacturing index fell 5.2 percentage points in December and an index measuring new orders tumbled 11 percentage points.The big unknown is the partial federal government shutdown.Depending on how long it lasts, the shutdown ""could be a big negative"" in next month's jobs report, which will reflect January employment, Kevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to President Trump, said Thursday.

Congressional Democrats oppose the move, and parts of the federal government have been shut down because of the impasse.The Department of Defense has not been affected by the shutdown.Last month Trump tweeted that ""the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall"" after he said that much of it already has been built. The president was referring to several hundred miles of existing fencing along the Southern border.A few days later, Trump repeated his intention to have the Defense Department do the job, saying in another tweet that because of crime and drugs flowing through the border ""the United States Military will build the Wall!""The Department of Homeland Security — which has had to cease some operations, although not border security — made the request for more troops to shore up the border with Mexico.The request will very likely mean the deployment of more forces, including combat engineers and aviation units. There are now some 2,300 active troops on the border and an additional 2,100 National Guard troops.The active-duty deployment was scheduled to be completed at the end of January, while the Guard troops are scheduled to remain until September.A senior military official said the new request could include thousands more troops and that installing the fencing could take months. The Pentagon is now considering which units to send.With the partial government shutdown now in its second week, Trump made a short and unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday to press for border wall funding.""The wall — you can call it a barrier, you can call it whatever you want — but essentially we need protection in our country,"" he said."

He posted a photo of that resignation on Twitter, and an avalanche of criticism soon followed from readers who assailed his penmanship, ethics and industry-friendly track record while managing 500 million acres of public lands.Zinke's letter was barely legible, but he typed out his missive as well: ""It's been a high honor to serve the President and the American People as Interior Secretary. We've restored public lands 'for the benefit & enjoyment of the people,' improved public access & shall never be held hostage again for our energy needs. God bless America & those who defend her.""One commenter on Twitter wondered, ""Only coloring markers and crayons available in this administration?""Maybe, one commenter posed to Zinke, the letter ""was written by the horse you rode in on.""NPR's Nathan Rott reports that the secretary's choice to ride a horse to work reflected how he imagined himself: as a modern incarnation of President Theodore Roosevelt, a conservationist who established the U.S. Forest Service as well as hundreds of national forests and reserves. ""Zinke went the opposite way, reducing protections on millions of acres of land by shrinking national monuments, opening up the coastlines and vast areas of the West to oil and gas leasing,"" Rott reports.Environmentalists groups including Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and the National Resources Defense Council assailed Zinke for his policies, NPR reports.Zinke's letter drew more fire from critics of his approach.""So this was written with the blood of an endangered animal, right?"" one commenter mused.Zinke departed his office under the threat of numerous ethics investigations. NPR reports one case is a real estate deal involving Zinke and the chairman of the oil and gas titan Halliburton. In another case, Zinke is suspected of blocking a proposal from Native American tribes in Connecticut to expand a casino because of political pressure and lobbying from MGM Resorts International. President Trump announced Zinke's resignation by tweet in mid-December. Zinke left office before Democrats were set to take control of the House of Representatives, where they could use their power to launch congressional probes.Oil and gas leaders have hailed Zinke for unlocking possibilities for energy development.At least one Twitter user had words of praise for the departing official: ""Thank you for all the work you have done for the people and for giving those of us on the land a voice! Something we haven't had in a long time!""Asked about Zinke's letter, the Interior Department said it was unable to comment on matters unrelated to the partial government shutdown. Zinke is latest among several Trump appointees who've left amid ethics concerns. This also includes former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.Former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt stepped down in July after questions emerged about his spending on security, travel and a $43,000 soundproof phone booth, NPR reports.Pruitt also spent $1,560 on a dozen customized fountain pens, The Washington Post reported. One reader pointed to that story and asked whether perhaps Zinke used one of those pens. ""It doesn't write worth &$%¥,"" she panned.Trump has not named a permanent replacement for Zinke. NPR reports that the acting secretary, David Bernhardt, is a former lobbyist for the oil industry who has also held several positions at the Department of the Interior. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/03/681827225/senate-sets-mid-january-confirmation-hearings-for-attorney-general-nominee","The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold confirmation hearings for President Trump's pick for attorney general on Jan. 15 and 16.If confirmed, William Barr will replace acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who was appointed after Jeff Sessions was forced out in November.Barr, 68, is a traditional conservative. He previously served as attorney general from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush. Barr has been an outspoken critic of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and a hard-liner on immigration, two positions that put him firmly in line with the White House.Barr supported the original version of Trump's travel ban, NPR's Joel Rose reports. That order limited immigration from Muslim-majority countries. The Supreme Court struck that initial version down, but later approved a narrower measure.Barr has also criticized U.S. asylum policy. NPR reports that in the 1990s, he said, ""If you come into the United States, no matter how clearly frivolous your claim is, and you set foot in the United States, and you're caught, can't put them on a plane and send them away if they say, 'I want to claim asylum.' ""The nominee may diverge with the White House on border security. Two decades ago, Barr dismissed the idea of a border wall, The Associated Press reports. In a 1992 interview with PBS, Barr said, ""I don't think it's necessary. I think that's overkill to put a barrier from one side of the border to the other."" It is unclear whether Barr's views on the border wall have changed since his comments.Trump has demanded $5 billion to fund a border wall; Democrats have refused and the government has been in partial shutdown for 13 days over the standoff.Barr has questioned the integrity of Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections. NPR's Ryan Lucas reports that the nominee raised concerns over political donations made by Mueller's team and has also outlined a broad view of presidential power. ""Democrats are looking for some guarantees from Barr. The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, wants him to commit under oath that he will not impede the Russia investigation and that he will make Mueller's final report available to Congress and to the public,"" Lucas reports.The Mueller investigation was an early and toxic wedge between the White House and Sessions, who recused himself from the probe. His interim successor, Whitaker, has been critical of the investigation as well and has refused calls from Democrats to remove himself from the process.On his Senate questionnaire, Barr notes he has had no unsuccessful nominations for appointed office. Since previously serving as attorney general, he has worked at a Washington, D.C., law firm and at GTE Corp. and its successor, Verizon Communications. He also provided consulting services to BP following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.NPR's Ron Elving says Barr is ""eminently confirmable by the Senate.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the anticipated incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, says Barr is ""a known quantity, a man of the highest integrity and character, and has an impeccable reputation."" Graham pledged to do ""everything in my power"" to confirm the nominee.Some Democrats, including Sen. Mazie Hirono, have voiced questions about Barr's independence. On CNN's New Day, the Hawaii senator said, ""We have a president who just cares about appointing people who are going to do his bidding, and that is not what we need as an attorney general."""

Democratic leaders said they pressed President Trump to accept their proposal to approve measures to fund through the end of the fiscal year those federal agencies that have run out of money and to provide a short-term funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would provide spending authority until early February. The proposal regarding DHS would give the two sides additional time to resolve the border security funding impasse.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans and the White House ""are now feeling the heat"" over the shutdown. ""It is not helping the president, it is not helping the Republicans to be the owners of this shutdown today,"" Schumer said. ""We gave them an opportunity to get out of that and open the government as we debate border security.""Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Democrats ""are asking the president to open up the government.  We are giving him a Republican path to do that — why would he not do that?"" On Twitter Wednesday evening, the president said the day's meeting had been an ""important"" one, adding that ""Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people – this is the first and most important duty of government."" In a second tweet, Trump said he remained "" ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" Before the briefing with Capitol Hill leadership, Trump reiterated his demand for a border wall Wednesday, saying that the border ""is like a sieve"" and that adding drones and technology are not enough.During a Cabinet meeting earlier, Trump said the government ""is in a shutdown because Democrats refuse to fund border security."" But Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have previously supported $1.3 billion for border security, an amount far less than the $5 billion the president has insisted on, and Democrats have refused to accede to Trump's demand for funding specifically for building a border wall.Trump also said Democrats are playing politics with the issue ""because they have an eye on 2020.""And the president repeated his call for a physical wall. ""Everything else is bells and whistles,"" he said.  ""I know more about drones than anybody. I know about every form of safety that you can have. It's all good, but it's just very minor compared to the power of a wall.""Trump said he would keep the government in a partial shutdown ""for as long as it takes,"" adding, ""I think the people of the country think I'm right."" But a NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll taken before the shutdown began had a different finding. By a 21-point margin — 57 percent to 36 percent — Americans think the president should compromise on the wall to avoid a government shutdown.  Other members of the administration chimed in during the Cabinet meeting, with praise for Trump's stance. Vice President Pence said, ""I want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security,"" adding that the administration ""is ready to deal, we have an offer on the table.""That offer, however, reportedly made by Pence to Democrats for $2.5 billion for border security, was publicly rejected by Trump later in the Cabinet meeting, illustrating the difficulties Democrats face in negotiating with the mercurial president. Lending an air of drama, Wednesday's briefing for congressional leaders occurred in the White House Situation Room, which is normally used for military updates. McConnell called it a civil discussion and said, ""We're hopeful in the coming days and weeks we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" an ominous sign for anyone hoping for a quick resolution to the shutdown."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2019/01/01/681361905/federal-workers-burdened-by-shutdown-face-trump-ordered-pay-freeze","President Trump on Friday issued an executive order freezing the salary rates for federal workers. The order wasn't a surprise but for some 800,000 federal employees furloughed during the partial government shutdown or working without pay, it was like rubbing salt into a wound.The president had been telegraphing his plans for a pay freeze for almost a year — first in his annual budget and again last summer in a letter to Congress. Trump pointed to the government's dire fiscal situation. Thanks to tax cuts and increased spending, the deficit has ballooned to more than a trillion dollars this year.Trump's order only applies to civilian workers. Military personnel, who are covered under a separate funding measure, will receive a 2.6 percent raise.Jacqueline Simon of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers union, tells NPR that ""the military deserve their pay increase, and we're strongly in favor of it. And, in fact, for many, many years — decades, even — there was parity between the civilian and the military workforces in terms of their pay adjustments.""For the last two years, though, paychecks for civilian government workers have grown more slowly than those in the military. And the president's pay freeze would widen that gap if it stands.Federal workers shouldn't give up hope — there is a chance they could get a raise. The Senate has already OK'd a pay raise for federal workers of 1.9 percent. And the new Democratic House is expected to follow suit. The president would have to sign the measure.The Washington Post reports: ""Federal employee pay raises are effective at the start of the first full biweekly pay period in the new year, which in this case will start Jan. 6. There will not be much time for enactment of a raise by then, but raises have been paid retroactively — most recently in 2003 and 2004, when agency funding also hadn't been resolved until after the start of the new year. In both cases, a raise had been paid by default in early January but was overridden by a larger one contained in a full-year appropriations bill."""

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as speaker. According to a Democratic leadership aide, the legislation will include the full-year appropriations for six of the seven outstanding funding bills and stop-gap funding until Feb. 8 for the Department of Homeland Security, which is where the fight over President Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding is contained. This is a Democratic proposal, and it is unclear whether it will be taken up by the Senate, where Republicans will expand their majority come Thursday, or if President Trump will support it. Speaker-designate Pelosi has previously stated that the House would take up a bill to reopen government as a first order of business. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will only put a bill on the floor if President Trump will support and sign it. The Senate previously passed a bill to keep the government open without the president's wall funding, before Trump changed his mind and decided not to sign it. The outgoing Republican House majority passed a bill with Trump's wall funds that was not passed by the Senate, where Democratic votes are necessary for such legislation. A proposal was floated on Sunday by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to trade wall funds for legislation addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and Temporary Protected Status, granted to those from a country where it's deemed unsafe to return. The same Democratic aide said in response, ""Unless the president puts a proposal on the table, there's nothing to discuss given how many times the president has changed his position.""Trump spent Monday morning taunting Democrats on Twitter, urging them to ""come back from vacation now"" as he remained at the White House. The president was also on the defensive over comments his outgoing chief of staff John Kelly made over the weekend about the status of plans for a border wall.  ""To be honest, it's not a wall,"" Kelly said in an exit interview with the Los Angeles Times. He added, ""The president still says 'wall' — oftentimes frankly he'll say 'barrier' or 'fencing,' now he's tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.""In response, Trump tweeted, ""An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media."" On Dec. 21, however, the president tweeted out a drawing of a barrier made of steel slats, calling it ""totally effective."" "

Instead, it appears the shutdown could last until 2019.The president has only a few more days to advance any spending agreement with the help of full GOP control in Washington. Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3, giving them significant new leverage over future spending talks. But on Thursday afternoon, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority whip, advised members that no votes were expected in the House this week. Scalise also told lawmakers that while the House awaits Senate action on a spending bill, he will aim to provide members with 24 hours' notice before any expected votes in the House. Representatives are likely to be waiting until next week as the Senate is not scheduled to be back in session until Jan. 2.The House and Senate briefly opened for business Thursday afternoon, but the momentary sessions were hardly a sign of behind-the-scenes negotiation. The halls of Congress have been nearly empty in recent days, save for a skeleton crew of staff and lawmakers. Democrats say they are all waiting for Trump to abandon his demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico.Trump is showing no signs of backing down. ""The President has made clear that any bill to fund the government must adequately fund border security to stop the flow of illegal drugs, criminals, MS-13 gang members, child smugglers and human traffickers into our communities – and protect the American people,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon. Sanders continued: ""The Administration understands this crisis and made a reasonable, common-sense solution to Democrats five days ago - we've not received a single response.  The President and his team stayed in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities, and re-open the government.  The Democrats decided to go home. The only rational conclusion is that the Democrat party is openly choosing to keep our government closed to protect illegal immigrants rather than the American people. The President does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our county's safety and security."" And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the likely next House speaker, showed no sign of backing down either. ""Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security – but not the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall,"" a spokesman for Pelosi said in a dueling statement Thursday afternoon. ""With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans."" On Twitter Trump also sought to blame Democrats for the shutdown.Trump has refused to sign any spending bill that does not include money for the border wall. Senate leaders have repeatedly said that money for the wall cannot be approved in the Senate, where Democrats have sufficient votes to block the legislation.So far, neither side has been willing to negotiate, leaving roughly 25 percent of the government without funding. Democrats say they have been willing to negotiate with the White House on more money for border security, but they do not trust that Trump will accept any agreement.Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have said they are getting conflicting guidance from White House aides.""Different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,"" the two leading Democrats said in a statement released on Christmas Eve. ""The president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.""But Trump insists Democrats are to blame, despite an earlier statement that he would personally take credit for a shutdown if one were to occur. In another tweet, he went on to claim without evidence that most of the workers who are being harmed by loss of wages in the shutdown vote for Democrats.Meanwhile federal workers are beginning to cope with the fallout. The Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, has posted guidance for workers on how to talk to creditors about diminished cash flow during a shutdown. Roughly 800,000 workers across the country will be impacted by the shutdown. The OPM estimates that 85 percent of federal workers, not including military personnel and postal employees, live and work outside of the Washington, D.C., area. Some will be furloughed, others will be asked to work without pay until the government reopens. Congress usually provides for federal employees to be repaid for lost wages during a shutdown but that does not extend to contract workers like many security guards and janitors."

This was sensitive.The president would be going to Iraq, leaving late Christmas night. I would be one of 13 pool journalists along for the surprise trip. For security reasons, it had to stay quiet. I could tell only my husband and one editor. And only in person, not over the phone, text or email. The secrecy around it was similar to how previous White House staffs had handled surprise trips by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to Iraq and Afghanistan. President Trump had been hinting for some time that he would make a visit to a combat zone. He had taken heat for making it so far into his presidency without visiting troops deployed in Afghanistan or in the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He had told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that he would go but ""had an unbelievable busy schedule,"" generating even more controversy. So it wasn't entirely a surprise that he would make a trip around the holidays.But then Trump announced he was pulling all American forces out of Syria and ordering the military to cut the number of troops in Afghanistan in half. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigned in protest. And there was the government shutdown.It seemed like an inopportune time to make such a trip. Or maybe it was the perfect time.I went home and told my husband we'd have to postpone our family vacation for a day. Oh, and I was going to Iraq and leaving him with our two kids, 6 years and 8 months old. And he couldn't tell anyone what was going on. My editor and I met at a cafe near my house. When she sat down, I passed her my notebook with the few details I had written out. We couldn't risk someone overhearing our conversation.Then we went into planning mode.How would we get everything out to all the other radio outlets and get the news onto NPR? What happens if there is no cellular data service? The next day was Christmas Eve and I went to NPR's booth in the basement of the White House just like normal. At one point I was talking to an editor who didn't know about the secret trip about coverage on Christmas Day and whether I'd get called in. He said, ""It doesn't look like he's going to Afghanistan.""Nope. I didn't say a thing.Christmas Day I was on the UpFirst podcast at 5 a.m., but after that it was quiet.We met up with our friends and their kids to see the new Spider-Man movie. I was tired and on edge, worried about the trip (as much about getting the foreign policy right and not screwing up my pool duties as about my safety) and desperate to tell this very close friend what was going on. But I couldn't let on. Later I texted with my parents and brother and couldn't tell them either.At some point I got an email from Sanders with the details. Meet at 9:30 p.m. at Joint Base Andrews, the military facility outside Washington, D.C., where Air Force One is based. We entered through an unlit gate you'd never know was there unless you were looking for it.As a White House reporter, I've flown on Air Force One more times than I can remember (though that probably just says something about my memory) and it was never like this. Normally, the iconic blue and white jumbo jet sits on the tarmac awaiting the president's arrival on Marine One, with TV cameras rolling. This time we boarded inside a massive, pristine hangar. The president left the White House in secret. Air Force One would take off just after midnight, in darkness, shades drawn so no one would see it and spill the news.The flight was long and uneventful. Near the end, an Air Force steward came through and asked us to make sure to leave our shades down. The lights were turned off too.When we got off the plane at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq it was pitch black outside, and we walked to a building on a dirt path lit by green and purple glow sticks.Trump marveled at the security around his arrival in Iraq.Asked if he had any concerns about making the trip, Trump said, ""Yeah, I had concern, but my bigger concern was maybe [for] the people that were with me.""He even thanked the press pool for coming along, out of character for a president who instinctively refers to reporters as fake news. ""You knew where you were going, and we appreciate your coming with us, very much so,"" Trump said. ""That takes courage also. We very much appreciate you coming with us.""The traveling press agreed to keep information about the trip embargoed until just before the president's visit was over, because of security concerns. Our cellphones were all scrambled anyway, so we had little choice. But it started to get out.Amateur flight trackers noticed the unusual plane model leaving the D.C. area, a VC-25, the specially modified Boeing 747 that serves the president. Someone tweeted a photo that appeared to show Air Force One flying over the U.K. Back in Washington, it was noted that the president himself was unusually silent on Twitter.In Iraq, Trump met with military leaders, including the commander of Operation Inherent Resolve. He softened his message that ISIS had been ""defeated,"" saying service members were responsible for the ""near elimination of the ISIS territorial caliphate"" and that in that meeting he had come up with a great plan for victory, details to be revealed later. He defended his decision to pull all troops out of Syria against the advice of ""the generals."" He talked down years-long U.S. military entanglements, saying now that he is president, ""we're not the suckers of the world."" He and first lady Melania Trump visited a festively decorated dining hall where service members sat around waiting for a special guest. They gave a standing ovation when they walked through the door. Trump signed autographs (including on a few well-worn ""Make America Great Again"" hats service members brought along), took selfies and made sure the press heard from a soldier who said he had re-enlisted in the Army because of Trump. And, as he often does, Trump broke with norms. In a speech that would traditionally solely offer holiday greetings and gratitude for service members' sacrifice, Trump added a dig at Democrats in Washington over the stalemate on border wall funding that has led to the partial government shutdown. When the president finished his remarks to troops, we were finally allowed to report the news. But Wi-Fi and cellular data still weren't working. Sanders got out a tweet before the press corps had strong enough Internet access to file our reports. Rushing back to Air Force One, I called my editor and dictated a brief pool report, which was distributed to the rest of the radio networks. The secret trip wasn't a secret anymore.Moments later, Air Force One departed three hours after it had arrived, still in darkness, shades drawn.Sanders told us the president was pleasantly surprised that none of the reporters traveling with him leaked news of the trip."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/26/680119113/after-big-losses-investors-keep-a-look-out-for-santa-claus-rally","Updated at 5:24 p.m. ETThe stock market came roaring back Wednesday with a rally that pushed up the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 1,000 points. It is the largest single-day point gain in the history of the Dow. In percentage terms, that's a gain of nearly 5 percent. The S&P 500 was up by a similar amount and the Nasdaq composite index was up even more — 5.8 percent.To be exact, the Dow gained 1086.25 points Wednesday. But even with that gain, it is still down 7.4 percent on the year. The S&P 500's year-to-date loss is a smidgen higher.Until Wednesday, the holiday season had been a big disappointment for investors and traders, with most of the losses coming in the previous four trading days.Tumbling over turmoilMarkets had reacted negatively to several events coming out of the nation's capital: the partial government shutdown, the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and what was widely seen as a bungled response to the market turmoil by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. After meeting with the CEOs of the six largest U.S. banks, Mnuchin tweeted that banks had ""ample liquidity"" to meet the needs of borrowers. But instead of being reassured by the comments, markets continued to tumble. When asked Tuesday if he had confidence in Mnuchin, President Trump said he did: ""Very talented, very smart person.""On Wednesday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that Trump was happy with Mnuchin's performance and told an NBC reporter that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's job is ""100 percent"" safe. The comments appeared to work together to play an important role in a ""relief rally"" of epic proportions.But concerns about a slowing global economy and the protracted trade dispute with China have not gone away, and they are likely to put pressure on the market again in coming days.A dreadful Christmas EveThe final week of 2018 trading didn't get off to a good start. On Monday, the Dow logged a nearly 3 percent loss — breaking a 100-year-old record for the worst showing on Christmas Eve.Stock markets in Asia were mixed on Wednesday. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index was up less than 1 percent, while markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were down less than half a percent.European markets were also mixed, with Frankfurt's DAX showing a small gain, while the FTSE 100 (London) and the CAC 40 (Paris) moved lower.If Wednesday's gains do not hold and slip away in the next three trading days, U.S. stocks could still have their worst December ever.The words ""bear market"" have recently been on the lips of more than a few traders and analysts. A bear market is a drop of 20 percent from a peak. At the start of Wednesday's trading, all the major indexes were in or close to a bear market. But the rally provided some relief. And for now, the bear is in hibernation.As for a Santa Claus rally, at least one market observer is trying to manage his expectations.""Year-end trading can be slow, as window-dressing can easily take over trades,"" Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices told The Washington Post. ""At this point the best gift Saint Nick can give us is a stable market. Gains would be a nice extra, but less volatility would help support confidence in the market, and permit longer-term investment decisions — by investors and corporate planners.""."

They raised their right hands and swore to defend the Constitution.Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, has a picture from that day blown up and framed on her office wall. There are familiar faces from the early days of the Trump White House: Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Hope Hicks, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Tom Bossert and Don McGahn. They are all gone now, along with many others who took the oath that day.""In the photo are 7 or 8 different faces of assistants to the president who have moved on or are no longer here,"" she said. ""They were either fired or forced out or resigned voluntarily. And I've had the picture up basically from Day One, but as each one left, it became a running joke of those remained.""Former White House counsel Don McGahn was the last one to go, and he wrote Conway a note telling her she could take the picture down. But she isn't sure she will.""It's a good reminder of where we started and where we are and the durability and toughness and longevity that some of us have,"" she said with pride.The Trump White House has set records for staff turnover. But rather than close out the year remembering those who are gone, we decided to take a look at those who survived. Conway is one of the survivors. Others who started in the initial days and are still there include presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. They were there in the photo on Conway's wall, but because of the angle it was shot from, they were obscured from view by the lectern.Press secretary Sarah Sanders, social media director Dan Scavino and Johnny DeStefano, who started as personnel director and now wears several hats, are all survivors as well.All in the familyMiller, Sanders and Conway are unbroken threads from the campaign. Scavino, the social media director, goes back even further. He worked as a caddie at one of Donald Trump's golf courses when he was a teenager. Now he sits in the tiny office just feet from the Oval Office where trusted aide and former communications director Hope Hicks used to sit.""He occupies such a unique role and such a trusted role,"" said Conway. ""He really is the man behind the mission — the mission of this president to communicate directly with America.""Or as former campaign adviser Barry Bennett put it: ""They share thumbs. They complete each other's tweets.""Scavino may be like family. But Kushner actually is family, married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka (who didn't get a formal White House job and title until March 2017). Kushner just helped push through criminal justice legislation, was part of negotiations on the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada and most recently was seen up on Capitol Hill trying to negotiate a solution to the partial government shutdown.""Jared has a very quiet demeanor that belies an incredibly strong will and robust intellect,"" Conway said.For a while, there was speculation that Kushner and Ivanka Trump might give up on Washington, but now insiders are saying they are in it for the long haul.""You can lose your title, but you're never going to lose being the daughter or the son-in-law,"" said Bennett.""Keeps his head down""Johnny DeStefano is a White House aide you've probably never heard of, and that likely has something to do with his staying power.""He keeps his head down and stays out of the constant internecine combat in the press that seems to be a feature of the Trump administration,"" said Michael Steel, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies who worked with DeStefano in former House Speaker John Boehner's office.DeStefano is an experienced Washington hand, which sets him apart from many in the Trump White House, who came from the business world and lacked government experience.""He is a smart guy who is going to do his work and has no interest in being on cable news, has no interest in reading his name in the newspaper,"" said Steel. ""He is a serious and hardworking public servant. That shouldn't be a distinguishing feature, but in this administration, it seems to be.""Aides with staying powerDon't see the graphic above? Click here.What do all these aides have in common?""Endurance,"" said Marc Lotter, with a laugh.Lotter was Vice President Pence's press secretary early in the administration. He's now part of the 2020 campaign advisory committee. And he's only sort of joking about the endurance thing.""[President Trump] wants his staff people debating. He wants to see the bad side arguments from one side and the good on the other,"" said Lotter. ""And he's going to pit them against each other. But when he makes the decision, your job is to go out and execute.""Which is to say: The survivors have a high tolerance for conflict and, in the end, will do or say what Trump asks — something outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ultimately wasn't willing to do.Conway says she has advised colleagues that if working in Trump's White House is more of a burden than a blessing, they should move on.Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who started as a deputy and was elevated in one of the earlier staff shake-ups, offered that a key to longevity is loving Trump and his agenda.""The people that are here really believe in what we are doing and believe that we're making a difference and we're proud of the work that we do every day,"" she said in an answer that is exactly what you would expect the president's top spokesperson to say.In the process of reporting this story, a question arose: Would it be out of date before being published? Would there be another visitor to the busy White House departures lounge?""Not that I know of,"" said Sanders. ""Certainly don't think so and don't hope so.""It's looks as if she was right."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/25/680087478/ice-continues-to-release-hundreds-of-asylum-seekers-into-public-park-in-el-paso","For the third day in a row, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials released hundreds of migrant asylum-seekers at a park near a bus station in downtown El Paso. The comparisons to Mary and Joseph wandering the roads of Bethlehem seeking shelter are unavoidable for dozens of volunteers who have stepped in to help. Especially on Christmas Day.""I kept having the phrase go through my head last night, 'There's no room at the inn, we've got to make some,'"" Kathryn Schmidt, a social worker who co-founded the Borderland Rainbow Center, an LGBTQ community center, told NPR.""I grew up Catholic... So it seemed like a no-brainer. There are people who are hungry, who don't have a place to stay....and it's Christmas,"" Schmidt added.Beginning on Sunday and continuing into Christmas Eve, ICE dropped off approximately 400 migrants near the Greyhound bus terminal with no apparent plan in place for the men, women and children.Typically, ICE coordinates with local shelters whenever the agency's processing centers are over capacity. But this time ICE failed to contact them in advance, and has continued to bus the mostly Central American immigrants to the public park, leaving them completely reliant on generous strangers who have been showing up in droves to distribute food, water and blankets as temperatures drop into the 40s.But by Christmas afternoon, when 134 immigrants were released by federal agents, ICE had resumed communications with local aid organizations who are now transporting the migrants to nearby shelters.It is unclear why ICE stopped coordination efforts with shelter groups and immigrant advocates. Officials could not respond to NPR's requests for comment due to the government shut down.An automatic email response from the agency explained, ""All of ICE's public affairs officers are out of the office for the duration of the government shutdown. We are unable to respond to media queries during this period because we are prohibited by law from working.""Dylan Corbett, who heads a local aid group called Hope Border Institute, told NPR that one of the ICE authorities present at the scene said 'I have a heavy heart, I'm a human being, but I'm following orders.' ""Also on Tuesday, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala became the second child this month to die while in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The boy, whose name has not been released, died shortly after midnight at a hospital in Alamogordo, N.M.Rep. Beto O'Rourke, (D-Texas), told CNN that ICE was expected to drop off another 200 on Wednesday bringing the total number over four days up to 800.The migrants who are released must appear before a severely backlogged immigration court at a future date. In the meantime, some are traveling to meet relatives elsewhere in the country.Dawn Vigil, a teacher at the University of Texas at El Paso, helped transport migrants from shelters back to the bus station. She described what it was like to encounter the families face-to-face: ""Heart-wrenching and heartwarming at the same time.""""You see it on social media, you can read about it...but actually being witness is incredibly powerful,"" Vigil told NPR, adding, ""That made me just full of love."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/25/680077240/president-trump-to-7-year-old-are-you-still-a-believer-in-santa","Updated at 1 a.m. Dec. 26The setting was perfect. The fire was beautifully ablaze, the trees enormously enormous, as the first couple sat beside dainty telephone tables ready to delight young callers in search of Santa.But what happened next could be considered less than perfect — especially for a young girl named Collman or her family, who might have had some explaining to do after the brief phone call.Collman and the president had been connected through NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which on Christmas Eve is tasked with tracking Santa's movements as he delivers gifts around the world. (It is still operating despite the partial government shutdown.)Since 1955, because of a serendipitous error, NORAD has kept tabs on the big guy in red. And in recent years, some children calling the where's-Santa-now hotline have been treated to a one-on-one conversation with the first lady or leader of the free world, who usually dispenses good cheer and happy holiday wishes.The president's delight in speaking extemporaneously is well-known, but it seems to go best when it's in front of large crowds of adult supporters.A few seconds into the chat with Collman, Trump asked: ""You doing well in school? ... What are you going to do for Christmas? ... Are you still a believer in Santa?""Naturally, the incident was captured on video as well as the moment that followed:""Because at 7 it's marginal, right?"" Trump asked the child.It's unclear how Collman responded or if she knows the meaning of the word marginal. The girl's side of the conversation was muted. But Trump appeared unfazed by the possibility he might have just told a child that Santa Claus doesn't exist.After a brief pause, Trump chuckled for a second and said, ""Well, you just enjoy yourself.""A 2011 survey by The Associated Press found average Americans say they continued to believe in Santa until they were nearly 9 years old.And as far as parenting tips on how to initiate what could be difficult conversations with children about Santa, the Tooth Fairy or the Easter Bunny, there's little evidence that they should be introduced by the president.By the end of the phone call, Trump had returned to more traditional conversational fare, telling Collman, ""Well, honey, happy Christmas."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/22/679509532/trump-administration-warns-palestinian-aid-recipients-that-funds-may-soon-be-cut","The Trump administration has slashed more than half a billion dollars in aid to the Palestinians this year. Now, the United States says it may cut more money for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The U.S. Agency for International Development told grant recipients by email Saturday to start planning for the possibility that their funding could end by January 31, due to a new U.S. anti-terrorism law that could compel the Palestinian Authority to compensate American victims of terror attacks in exchange for U.S. assistance — a step Palestinian authorities are considered unlikely to agree to.One U.S.-funded aid group, Anera, said such a funding cut would block at least two planned infrastructure projects to provide clean water to homes in Gaza, which faces a water crisis, as well as a playground for Gaza youth. ""It could mean the U.S. is taking itself out of a constructive development role,"" said Sean Carroll, president of Anera.A U.S. official said the USAID funding cut was not final, and aid money could continue if Congress passes an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act after the government shutdown. A Senate aide said there was bipartisan interest in Congress to find a fix to allow funding to continue. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were unauthorized to brief the media on the matter.The anti-terrorism law could also put an end to U.S. funding to Palestinian Authority security forces, which coordinate with Israel to maintain security in the West Bank. An official in Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' office told NPR he believed the U.S. would find a way not to cut security funds.In recent months, the U.S. has slashed $300 million for Palestinian refugees and more than $200 million for humanitarian assistance, economic projects, medical aid and peace-building activities for Palestinians. The cuts were made, in part, to pressure Palestinian leaders to cooperate with U.S. efforts to broker a peace deal with Israel. Palestinian leaders have not resumed ties with the Trump administration since it recognized Jerusalem last December as Israel's capital, a city where Palestinians also have claims. Administration officials say they will unveil a peace plan soon.U.S.-funded aid groups say they had been expecting possible funding cuts. Kids4Peace, a group that runs joint programs for Israeli and Palestinian high school students in Jerusalem, said it has raised money from other sources to ensure its programs can continue without U.S. help. The group said it is a finalist for receiving a $1.5 million USAID grant next year, but fears the grant may now be cut.""Because of USAID, Kids4Peace has doubled in size, professionalized operations, and launched a new youth-led social action program that is creating peace in Jerusalem from the ground up,"" said Fr. Josh Thomas, executive director of Kids4Peace International.  ""Without continued funding, we will have to turn away hundreds of Muslim, Jewish and Christian families who want a nonviolent, pro-peace youth program for their kids.""Dave Harden, who oversaw U.S. aid to Palestinians under the Obama administration and now directs the Georgetown Strategy Group, criticized the possible funding cuts.""This is another example of the Administration vacating political space, putting at grave risk of any hope for stability, and ceding influence to our adversaries,"" Harden said."

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/22/679424044/government-shuts-down-ahead-of-holiday-over-stalemate-on-border-wall-funding","Updated at 3:45 p.m. ETThe partial shutdown of the federal government that began just after midnight Saturday won't be ending anytime soon. The Senate has adjourned with no business in the chamber anticipated before Thursday afternoon and, maybe not even then, if congressional leaders and President Trump can't reach an agreement over the president's demand for $5 billion in funding for his border wall. The House and Senate convened at noon Saturday, but no votes were scheduled and many lawmakers have already left town. House GOP leaders have advised lawmakers that they will be given 24 hours' notice of any planned vote.In remarks on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put the burden on Trump to cut a deal with House and Senate Democratic leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. ""When those negotiations produce a solution that is acceptable to all of those parties, it will receive a vote here on the Senate floor,"" McConnell said.Trump announced on Twitter that he would be holding a lunch meeting in the White House residence with a ""large group"" to discuss border security. That group included conservative members of Congress, no Democrats. Separately, Schumer met with Vice President Pence. Not long after the lunch ended, McConnell announced the Senate was going home. ""Senators will be notified when a vote is scheduled. In the meantime, negotiations will continue,"" he said. It is the third time this year that the federal government has been shuttered, even if only briefly. A government shutdown is typically an unlikely occurrence and had been virtually unheard of under unified party control, underscoring the dysfunction that has become normal in Washington even with a GOP-controlled Congress and White House through year's end. But with Democrats set to control the House of Representatives come January, Trump saw the chance of receiving the funding he desired for his signature campaign issue about to vanish. Under pressure from his base and conservative commentators, he insisted that more than $5 billion in funding for his border wall be included in any spending measure passed to keep all of the government operating. He seemed to be flexible on the materials that would be used for the wall, as he has reportedly talked about steel slats and even tweeted a cartoon-like rendering of such an idea, but billions in spending to build some type of barrier along the southwestern border remains a requirement. That remained the Trump administration position on Saturday afternoon, with the demand being $5 billion in funding for a physical barrier. But an administration official, who declined to go on the record while briefing reporters, said this was an area of negotiation and that it doesn't have to be made of concrete. ""[President Trump] is talking about a 20- to 30-foot steel slat barrier,"" the official said. ""That's important. That said, we are also trying to get other border security priorities accomplished as well and so it is part of the negotiations that are taking place.""On Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill that would have funded the government through early February and it looked as if a shutdown would be avoided. But that deal fell apart on Thursday, when Trump indicated he wouldn't sign that bill after all. The House then passed legislation that included the money Trump wants for the border wall, but the House bill doesn't have the votes to pass in the Senate. McConnell said Friday night that the Senate wouldn't take any more futile votes until a deal all sides could support was reached. Vice President Pence, who had to break a tie on a procedural vote in the Senate on Friday evening, budget chief and incoming White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner met with both Republican and Democratic party leaders throughout the day and into the evening. Three-quarters of the government is not affected, because budget bills funding those operations had already been approved. But the remaining 25 percent subject to the shutdown includes Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation departments. Even among those affected, some personnel are deemed essential and will be expected to report to work without pay, for now. That includes FBI officers,  Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration agents — during one of the busiest travel periods of the year. In the past, however, Congress has approved back pay for furloughed federal workers. The political finger-pointing over who was to blame started well ahead of final negotiations. Trump tweeted Friday morning that ""The Democrats now own the shutdown!"" However, in an Oval Office meeting last week with House Minority Leader Pelosi, the likely next speaker of the House, and Senate Minority Leader Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over the wall. ""I'll be the one to shut it down. I will take the mantle. And I will shut it down for border security,"" Trump said then. Trump had been slated to depart Friday for a 16-day holiday vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida but postponed the trip once it was clear the government would shut down. On Friday night, Trump posted a video to Twitter seeming to take yet another position about responsibility for the shutdown vis-à-vis Democrats. ""We're going to have a shutdown. There's nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes. Call it a Democrat shutdown, call it whatever you want, but we need their help to get this approved,"" the president said. ""So Democrats, we have a wonderful list of things we need to keep our country safe. Let's get out, let's work together, let's be bipartisan and let's get it done. The shutdown will hopefully not last long."" Democrats, however, framed the situation far differently. On Thursday, Schumer said Trump's ""temper tantrum will shut down the government, but it will not get him his wall."" And Thursday night, Pelosi said on Twitter that ""Democrats are for real border security solutions. Not for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on an immoral, ineffective & expensive wall."""

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,"" he wrote.""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""This week Trump made two major decisions that overruled the advice of his defense secretary — withdrawing all U.S. troops from Syria and ordering a reduction of the U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan by approximately half.Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane, a close friend of Mattis' who had recommended him to Trump for the job of defense secretary, told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly on All Things Considered he believed those moves may have been the impetus for Mattis' decision to depart the administration in February of next year.Retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto, ""The kind of leadership that causes a dedicated patriot like Jim Mattis to leave should give pause to every American.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was frank in his statement, indicating he agrees with many of Mattis' criticisms of Trump's foreign policy:Other senators sounded a similar refrain. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted that Mattis' letter ""makes it abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances & empower our adversaries,"" but he hopes Trump can be persuaded to do otherwise.""This is a sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the president needs to hear,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic. ""Mattis rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home. Isolationism is a weak strategy that will harm Americans and America's allies. Radical Islamic jihadists are still at war with us, and no ISIS is not gone.""Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, tweeted that Mattis' departure was because Trump was ignoring ""sound military advice.""Democrats sounded even more alarmed. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, tweeted the defense secretary's resignation was ""scary"" and added that ""Mattis has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.""Speaking to reporters about the looming possibility of a partial government shutdown, Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York also expressed anxiety over Mattis' departure.""I'm shaken by the news because of the patriot that Secretary Mattis is. I think everybody in the country should read his letter of resignation,"" Pelosi said, waving the document. She said she has concerns about ""what it means to our country, for the message it sends to our troops and for the indication of what his view is of the commander-in-chief.""Schumer echoed her remarks, saying ""everything that indicates stability, everything that indicates strength, everything that indicates knowledge is leaving this administration,"" and pointing to the upcoming departure of White House chief of staff John Kelly, another retired Marine Corps general, and the resignation of former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, a retired Army lieutenant general who departed earlier this year.Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said ""Mattis is a true patriot who leads by example and served with great fidelity and dedication to our men and women in uniform. He served as a stabilizing force in a chaotic Administration that seems to be unravelling....President Trump is leading the country in the wrong direction and Secretary Mattis isn't willing to go along with it.""Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that ""Mattis' letter of resignation is the plea of a patriot put in an untenable position"" and that his exit ""is deeply alarming – almost our worst nightmare. He leaves a chasm of leadership that could be destabilizing to national security policies and morale."" He called Mattis ""a model of patriotism and public service"" in ""an administration filled with self-enriching and self-aggrandizing grifters.""Former Vice President Joe Biden, who's weighing a 2020 White House bid to challenge Trump, tweeted that while he has disagreed at times with Mattis, ""we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer,"" which he said the Trump administration has ""abandoned."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/20/678602214/senate-approves-temporary-funding-bill-house-likely-to-act-today-avoiding-shutdo","Updated at 10:48 p.m. ETThe House passed a short-term funding bill Thursday night that includes the money for additional border security President Trump wants — but the measure is unlikely to pass the Senate, raising the likelihood of a partial government shutdown that would begin Friday night at midnight. Trump signaled earlier Thursday that he would not sign a temporary funding measure from Congress that doesn't include funding that could be used to pay for his trademark border wall, torpedoing the bill the Senate passed earlier this week without any wall funding that would have kept the government funded through early February. ""I've made my position very clear — any measure to fund the government has to include border security. Not for political purposes but for our country, for the safety of our community,"" Trump reiterated ahead of a signing ceremony for the farm bill, adding that ""a nation without borders is a nation not at all.""Efforts to avoid a partial shutdown were thrown into chaos earlier in the day by the president. The House looked ready to pass the Senate's short-term spending bill, trying to avoid a messy fight just ahead of Christmas and as many lawmakers were eager to get home. But then House GOP leaders went to the White House and emerged saying that Trump had said he wouldn't sign the measure. Now, Trump finds himself in a standoff with Congress over his signature campaign promise — which he repeatedly said throughout the presidential race that Mexico would pay for. House GOP leaders, in their last few days wielding the majority, acquiesced to the president and put the new measure, which included $5.7 billion to fund Trump's border wall and $7.8 billion for disaster relief, to a vote. Democratic congressional leaders had argued last week such a bill couldn't pass in the House, but it did by a vote of 217-185. Eight Republicans opposed the bill. However, the House bill is expected to be dead on arrival in the Senate, where Republicans have only a two-seat majority and any legislation needs 60 votes to move forward. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office said the Senate would begin consideration of the House version on Friday, which would require consent for expedited consideration — something Democrats could block. Trump is scheduled to depart Friday for a 16-day vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, but a senior White House official said he will not go if there is a shutdown.In his remarks prior to the House vote Thursday night, Trump had not specified a dollar figure he wanted and had suggested that the money could be used to build ""steel slats"" rather than a traditional wall to give lawmakers ""a bit of an out."" That distinction was not likely to sway any Democrats or moderate Republicans who oppose approving new money for any kind of physical barrier on the border.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., likely to be the next House speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said GOP leaders told them Trump had pledged on Wednesday to support the continuing resolution to keep the government open, but they argued before the House vote that the president had been swayed instead by conservative pundits on Fox News and elsewhere to be obstinate instead. ""President Trump is throwing a temper tantrum and creating a Trump shutdown of the government,"" said Schumer. ""The president is doing everything he can to shut down the government,"" Pelosi added. In a tweet and a video posted online Thursday evening, the president said, ""Border security must become a #1 priority!"" and accused Democrats of putting politics before country.  Republican leaders introduced legislation late Thursday afternoon that included roughly $5 billion in border wall funding and $8 billion in disaster aid. The decision to package it all together was a last-minute reversal from a plan outlined by Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican leader.Scalise originally told Republicans that lawmakers would have a chance to vote on the border wall and disaster funding as a separate amendment. Instead of rejecting the package, the House sent a new bill to the Senate, where Democrats are certain to block it.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued this statement after the meeting with House GOP leaders:Plans for a speedy vote on a short-term spending bill crumbled earlier Thursday ahead of Friday night's deadline as some House Republicans threatened to pull their support for any spending measure that did not include additional border security money. House GOP leaders struggled to persuade members to support a bill to extend current spending levels through Feb. 8. Many are concerned that Republicans will not have another chance to fulfill Trump's demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico. The Senate approved a spending measure Wednesday night that did not satisfy Trump on the issue of border security.Conservatives such as Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., said voting on the short-term spending bill without border wall money amounts to a surrender on one of Trump's signature campaign promises. Brooks said he is confident that the House could uphold a veto — if a spending bill does pass and Trump refuses to sign it. But Brooks, like most Republicans, said they have no clear sign from Trump about what he is willing to support.""That is the $5 billion question,"" Brooks said. ""I wish we had clarity on that; that would help us decide what to do.""Trump tweeted Thursday morning that Democrats know ""Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security"" and are ""putting politics over Country"" by refusing to fund the wall. He also threatened ""not to sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security."" In a tweet later in the morning, Trump said he was ""promised the Wall and Border Security"" by congressional leadership when he signed a spending package last year and that ""it didn't happen!"" Frustration with the spending bill extends beyond a core group of conservatives who typically oppose spending bills. Some reliable leadership allies, such as Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., also expressed concerns about the spending bill.""This is a different circumstance. We're about to lose the majority and we've made promises that haven't been kept,"" Womack said. ""If we aren't willing to fight now on the way out of the majority, then when are we willing to fight?"" Republican leaders had hoped to easily approve a spending measure to avoid a last-minute panic over spending. Funding for about a quarter of the government will run out at midnight on Friday, and the government will be forced to partially close unless a spending measure is agreed to.Support among House Republicans began to crack Wednesday night before the Senate vote even occurred.Members of the House Freedom Caucus, some of the most conservative members of Congress, railed against the wall-less spending plan in a string of speeches on the House floor. The group's chairman, North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows, urged Trump to veto the spending measure, saying, ""We're going to back you up. If you veto this bill, we'll be there."" The frustration grew Thursday morning during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. Members emerged confused about the plan for the spending bill, telling reporters that the entire plan for a vote expected later in the day was up in the air. Ryan stepped out of a closed-door meeting of GOP House members to take a phone call from the president. As that call stretched on, leadership members decided to cancel a regularly scheduled press briefing ahead of the White House meeting.The spending measure, also known as a continuing resolution, would fund nine Cabinet-level departments and several independent agencies through Feb. 8, when Congress would again be forced to confront the issue. But Democrats, who will control the House in the next Congress, have adamantly refused to provide money for a wall.In a speech Wednesday, McConnell said he was ""sorry that my Democratic colleagues couldn't put the partisanship aside and show the same good-faith flexibility that the president has shown in order to provide the resources our nation needs to secure the integrity of our borders as well as the safety of American families.""A presidential veto or the failure of the House and the Senate to pass the same bill would mean that hundreds of thousands of federal employees including Border Patrol, FBI and DEA agents and TSA officers would continue to work over the Christmas holiday but without pay, while hundreds of thousands of other federal workers would be furloughed.But Trump was optimistic late Thursday. ""Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall,"" the president tweeted, adding ""So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!"" In a second tweet, Trump sought to put pressure on Democrats including Pelosi. ""Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn't have the votes for Border Security. ...  Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!""  "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/20/678557749/fact-check-border-wall-funding","President Trump launched his campaign in 2015 promising, ""I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."" Before long, supporters were chanting, ""Build the wall!"" and Trump was leading them in a call and response. Who will pay for the wall? Mexico.  He told rally-goers that a lot of politicians said it wouldn't be possible to get Mexico to pay for it. ""It's going to be so easy; it's going to be so easy,"" Trump insisted at the time.   Times have changed. Mexico still hasn't paid for it, and the GOP-controlled Congress is debating yet another short-term government funding bill that doesn't contain the $5 billion in wall money over which Trump threatened a government shutdown just a week ago.  His conservative media allies are rebelling, including Laura Ingraham of Fox News, who tweeted Wednesday, ""It was supposed to be a 'big beautiful wall' with a 'big beautiful door.' Now it's just an open door with no frame. Unreal."" All of this has Trump offering new and increasingly far-fetched explanations for how the wall will be built and how Mexico will pay for it.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump offered a new pitch for how the border wall will get done: ""Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S.,"" he wrote. ""The United States Military will build the Wall!"" Trump talks about the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, like the new trade agreement is already in place. It isn't.   It still has to be ratified by Congress and the legislatures in Mexico and Canada. So, the president's claim that far more money is coming into the U.S. couldn't possibly be true at this point. But will it be true in the future? ""There is no guarantee that on a net basis this trade agreement will produce more economic benefits for the U.S. than NAFTA did in the past,"" said David Gantz, a law professor at the University of Arizona who focuses on trade agreements. ""We don't know yet, and we won't know for several years."" Gantz said when NAFTA was approved, backers oversold the economic benefits to the U.S. And while he argues there are some good improvements and updates in the USMCA, they aren't expected to supercharge economic growth in the U.S. Asked about possible economic growth as a result of the USMCA bringing in more tax revenue, Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, ""We have no guarantee that that would happen including because the USMCA is first of all not all that different from NAFTA."" At the White House press briefing earlier this week, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to explain how the USMCA would pay, even indirectly, for the wall. Here's the exchange:  It's not clear where her math is coming from, though. The White House Council of Economic Advisers hasn't studied the expected economic impacts of the new trade deal yet, and neither has the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which led negotiations. If Trump and Sanders are referring to revenue from tariffs, economist de Bolle points out that wouldn't be coming from Mexico, either.  ""If you are collecting more revenues, it's because you're making your own consumers pay more for something that they were paying less for before,"" she said. ""You're making the Treasury better off at the expense of your own consumers. It's not at the expense of some other country. It's not.""  Trump also claims that ""because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!"" This raises two questions: 1. Does the military have the authority to build the wall? 2. Does it have the money to build the wall? Earlier this month, in an email to NPR's Tom Bowman, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Jamie Davis addressed the question of legal authority: As for the funding, that is a much stickier challenge.  ""This is not going to happen,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who specialized in military budgeting.  Here's why he is making such a bold prediction: ""For the military to build the wall, that would qualify as a military construction project, and there's not any money currently appropriated for this — certainly not $5 billion,"" he said.  So, let's say the president decided the military should take money already set aside for something else and use it to build the wall instead — that would require approval from Congress. Harrison says all the relevant committees in both chambers would have to approve shifting, or ""reprogramming,"" the funds. There are also caps on just how much money can be moved that way.  ""If any one of those committees says no, you can't do it,"" Harrison said.  He has a hard time imagining those committees signing off. ""It would be coming at the expense of other priorities in the military,"" Harrison said. ""Even if they agree with the wall, they would say, 'Hey, don't take our money to pay for it. This money is intended for the military. That's what it was approved for, and that's what we want it to be used for.' "" The process would be the same if the Trump administration wanted to shift funds to the wall from other agencies as well. Congress controls the purse strings.  And that only becomes a harder sell once Democrats take control of the House and the relevant committees in January. "

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/12/11/675425269/trump-to-meet-with-chuck-and-nancy-expectations-are-low","Updated at 5:37 p.m. ETIn a testy Oval Office exchange with the two top congressional Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, President Trump made clear he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government in less than two weeks if he doesn't get funding for his border wall.""I'll be the one to shut it down. I will take the mantle. And I will shut it down for border security,"" Trump told House and Senate Democratic leaders as Vice President Pence sat by stoically.The statement from Trump came in an extraordinary show before the cameras and the press, with minutes of tense back-and-forth with both Pelosi, the likely incoming House speaker, and Schumer, the Senate minority leader.Democratic leaders have made it clear they don't intend to give the president a victory on funding for his signature border wall, and afterward they released a statement reiterating that ""We gave the president two options that would keep the government open. It's his choice to accept one of those options or shut the government down.""Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill at a holiday reception later Tuesday she and Trump had spoken on the phone but there was no response to the earlier offer from her and Schumer. According to an aide, the call was around 4 p.m. and lasted about a minute. Speaking immediately after the meeting, both Schumer and Pelosi thought they had emerged with the upper hand after seemingly baiting Trump into taking the blame if there's a partial shutdown just days before Christmas. ""This Trump shutdown, this temper tantrum he seems to want to throw, will not get him his wall,"" the Senate minority leader told reporters outside the White House. Throughout the meeting, Trump kept insisting that much of the wall has already been built (numerous fact-checkers earlier this year determined it hasn't, which Schumer pointed out) and he has also said that the military can build the rest. In a statement provided to NPR Tuesday evening, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense said ""to date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall."" But ""Congress has provided options under [existing law] that could permit the Department of Defense to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.""  During the 2016 campaign, Trump also kept claiming that Mexico would pay to build the wall, but he has since dropped that talking point. Pelosi insisted during the meeting that the cameras should leave, saying afterward she made such a request because ""we didn't want to contradict the president when he was putting forth figures that have no basis in fact. ... I didn't want to say in front of those people, 'You have no idea what you're talking about.' "" Except by making that comment just after leaving the Oval Office, Pelosi was saying just that. She also kept trying to explain to Trump that there wasn't enough support even in the GOP-controlled House for his border wall, urging him to accept a continuous funding resolution at the current spending levels, or $1.3 billion for a year. But Trump kept interjecting to shift blame, saying a House vote wouldn't matter since he needs to get to 60 votes in the Senate anyway and that would require help from Democrats — a frequent complaint of his.Back on Capitol Hill, Pelosi told fellow Democratic lawmakers in private that she was ""trying to be the mom"" in the room. ""I can't explain it to you. It was so wild. It goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you,"" Pelosi said, according to an aide in the room. ""You can't let him take you down that path. But the fact is we did get him to say, to fully own that the shutdown was his. That was an accomplishment.""In another comment sure to irk the president, Pelosi went even further, saying that Trump's obsession with the border wall is ""like a manhood thing for him.  As if manhood could ever be associated with him.""The tense exchanges underscored the challenges in the coming two years of divided government. Trump diverted from discussing Democrats' takeover of the House, choosing to focus on GOP gains in the Senate — thanks, in large part, to a very Republican-friendly map in the 2018 midterms. ""When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble,"" Schumer jabbed. ""Well, I did,"" Trump retorted. The White House tried to paint a very different picture of the meeting after the fact, with press secretary Sarah Sanders saying in a statement, ""President Trump had a constructive dialogue with Democrat Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi,"" although ""Major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency.""Trump himself told reporters later on Tuesday that ""believe it or not, I think it was a very friendly meeting. ... I've actually liked [Schumer and Pelosi] for a long period of time, and I respect them both"" and that ""when the press left, we had a fairly long meeting and we really discussed a lot of great subjects.""And the president showed no regrets for having said he would own a shutdown if it comes to that. ""If we close down the country I will take it, because we're closing it down for border security, and I think I win that every single time,"" Trump said. Speaking on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., acknowledged it had been a ""spirited meeting"" at the White House, but that ""I'd still like to have a smooth ending here"" and avoid a government shutdown. ""I'm sort of hoping for a Christmas miracle here that we'll have a level of cooperation that we don't normally have in getting bills across the Senate floor,"" McConnell said, pointing to not just the government funding bill but the farm bill and a criminal justice overhaul. Democratic resistance to funding the wall may have prompted Trump's pre-meeting tweetstorm, which over a series of five long tweets seemed to simultaneously concede defeat and declare victory on wall funding.Troops have been stationed along the Southern border with Mexico since just before the midterm elections, and while some are being extended through the end of January, other units have been sent home.""He's talking about reprogramming/transferring funds from other [Department of Defense] programs,"" said Stan Collender, a federal budget expert, when asked if he could explain the Trump tweets. ""That would indeed take away resources from other activities.""Collender said he wasn't sure how much discretion Trump would actually have to do this and said it will ""get the new Democratic House very angry.""Even before the Tuesday morning tweetstorm, in recent days Trump had been far less specific about his demands for border wall funding than he has been in past rounds of budget talks. Sometimes he leaves out specific dollar amounts (though the standing request is $5 billion). And his use of the phrase ""border security"" indicates more than just funding to build the wall.""Congress must fully fund border security in the year-ending funding bill,"" Trump said Friday in a speech at a law enforcement conference. ""We have to — we have to get this done. They're playing games. They're playing political games. I actually think the politics of what they're doing is very bad for them, but we're going to very soon find out. Maybe I'm not right, but usually I'm right.""Democrats, looking at public opinion, may feel they have some leverage in the talks. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll out Tuesday shows that 57 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of independents, want the president to compromise on the border wall to prevent gridlock and not risk a government shutdown. Two-thirds of Republicans, however, want the president to stand his ground. And Trump is often laser-focused on his base.A history of failed meetings with ""Chuck and Nancy""The days of high expectations for White House summits leading to bipartisan breakthroughs were well in the past even before Tuesday's Oval Office throw down.A little more than a year ago, Trump had a couple of meetings with Schumer and Pelosi. He said he had worked out a deal on immigration with ""Chuck and Nancy,"" as he called them.""I think something can happen,"" Trump told reporters. ""We'll see what happens. But something will happen.""Nothing happened. The deal blew up without even an agreement on what the deal was. Can Trump work with a Democratic House next year?The sparring between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer may well be a preview of the next two years of divided government. Both Trump and Pelosi, who is expected to once again become speaker when Democrats take control of the House, have talked about the potential for bipartisan compromise on things like infrastructure and prescription drug prices. But they've also both foreshadowed conflict. Pelosi and Democrats are promising robust investigations of Trump and his administration, and Trump has said that would lead to a ""warlike posture.""""Then at the end of two years, nothing is done,"" Trump predicted. ""Now what's bad for them is being in the majority; I'm just going to blame them.""This leaves many questions: Are Democrats willing or able to compromise with Trump? Is Trump willing to deal? If he is, will congressional Republicans go along? And given the way Trump has changed his mind in the midst of past negotiations, will anyone trust him?Still, allies of the president and Pelosi interviewed for this story say some limited compromise is possible.""I think there's several positions the president has that frankly line up more traditionally with Democrats,"" said Marc Short, former director of legislative affairs for the Trump administration. ""The question I think that is yet to be determined is whether or not Democrats will give their leadership the flexibility to negotiate with the president.""That's one way of pinning blame back on the other party when big things fail to get done. Short also questioned whether Democrats would be willing to give Trump a win as he begins his re-election campaign in earnest.John Lawrence, a former chief of staff to Pelosi, countered that Democrats are likely open and looking to cut some deals.""[Pelosi] is going to be, and I think Democrats in the House are going to be, concerned with proving that they can be trusted that they can govern,"" Lawrence said. Short and Lawrence both see incentives for their respective parties to get something done, while questioning whether those incentives exist for the other side. But first they have to make it to next year. And the budget fight brewing as 2018 closes out could well affect the relationship going forward.

About two-thirds of Republicans say the opposite, and the president has been focused on maintaining his base.Don't see the graphic above? Click hereCongress moved last week to fund the government temporarily until Dec. 21. A major sticking point in funding negotiations is the president's insistence on an additional $5 billion to help fund the building of a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.""The wall is polarized in terms of partisanship,"" said Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll at the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. ""It's an important issue for the president's base. It is something that is not a particular interest or priority for Democrats and independents in the country, but what they all agree on is they don't want to see gridlock, and they don't want to see a government shutdown.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged the president to hold his ground during a Sunday show appearance.""If I were the president, I would dig in and not give in on additional wall funding,"" Graham said Sunday on Fox News. ""I want the whole $5 billion because the caravan is a game-changer."" But not only do most Americans oppose risking a government shutdown over a wall, but more than two-thirds (69 percent) do not believe building a wall should even be an immediate priority for Congress. That includes half who do not believe it should be a priority at all. More than a quarter (28 percent) believe it should be an immediate priority, including 63 percent of Republicans.Immigration is a cultural touchstone issue that Trump used to fuel his campaign. It's an issue that has energized his supporters, highlighted a seemingly unbridgeable schism between the parties and helped move independents largely toward Democrats' positions on the subject.Don't see the graphic above? Click hereTo that point, the poll found that while 53 percent of Americans support President Trump broadly on his handling of protection of U.S. borders, they disagree with him when diving further into the details of immigration policy."" 'If you don't have borders, you don't have a nation' — that has more resonance as an abstract goal,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist institute. ""For the president, it seems to break down with the devil in the details.""Just 44 percent approve of Trump's immigration policy overall, which mirrors his most recent Marist Poll overall job approval rating of 42 percent; 39 percent approve of his handling of the ""migrant caravan,"" a group of Central Americans making their way toward the U.S.; and just 36 percent approve of his handling of immigrants already in the United States illegally and the reunification of immigrant children separated from their parents at the border.On Trump's overall immigration policy, the caravan, immigrants in the U.S. illegally and separated families, about half or more of independents disapproved of the job Trump was doing.The numbers show that how the parties talk about immigration is key to winning over a critical mass, but they also show the risk in the stridency of Trump's message heading into the 2020 presidential election.""There's a risk immigration could be something that becomes one of several very intense issues, which is very double-edged for the president,"" Miringoff said. ""I don't think we have third rails in politics anymore, but we certainly have hot-button issues, and this is one that's fraught with danger for him.""The poll was conducted from Nov. 28-Dec. 4, surveyed 1,075 adults and has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points."
