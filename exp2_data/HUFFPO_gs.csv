The short-term deal came on the 35th day of the shutdown, the longest in United States history, and after over 800,000 federal workers had already missed two paychecks. (Trump promised the affected workers would get back pay ìvery quickly or as soon as possible.)He said he is prepared to shut down the government again if funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period.The U.S. economy may never recover $3 billion lost during the shutdown, according to a report released by the Congressional Budget Office.The political gridlock in Washington, D.C., also affected the countryís many national parks, which were left open during the shutdown.National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration decided to keep them open, leaving them understaffed and vulnerable to misuse for over a month.Just eight rangers were on hand to oversee Joshua Treeís sprawling 790,636 acres during the shutdown.†Spokesman George Land†said in a statement†this month that the park witnessed ìincidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees.îWith the gates open and minimal staffing, some visitors drove their vehicles off roads, graffitied rocks, started illegal campfires and cut down some of the famed trees that lend the park its name.Joshua trees grow just 1/2 to 3 inches a year and usually reach about 5 to 10 feet before they start to produce blossoms, according to the National Park Service. The tallest tree in the park rises to a whopping 40 feet.ìSome researchers think an average lifespan for a Joshua tree is about 150 years, but some of our largest trees may be much older than that,î the†NPS says on its website.John Lauretig, who runs the Friends of Joshua Tree nonprofit, was one of a host of local volunteers who picked up the slack, cleaning overflowing toilets and trash areas and providing other basic maintenance work.†ìThe local community is fed up with our parks being held hostage and the fact that itís open and partially staffed is not good for the park, itís not good for the public and itís not good for the local community here,î Lauretig†said at Saturdayís rally. ìIf the government doesnít fund or staff the parks appropriately, then they should just close the parks to protect the parks and protect the people.îThe NPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Joshua Tree is a place of haunting natural beauty, a place where the American West and its associated longings and fantasies are manifested.But thereís a deceptiveness to the hard, craggy stones, spiky trees and barren-seeming landscape.Casey Schreiner, a journalist who works to educate people on how to responsibly enjoy the West Coastís natural beauty, told The New York Timesí California Today column this month that desert ecosystems are more fragile than they look.Deserts are home to delicate flora dependent on a fine layer of cryptobiotic soil that, as he told the Times, ìcan take literally thousands of years to form and can be crushed with a single footprint.î"

To qualify for the benefits, Meskunas had to demonstrate to the state that sheís actively seeking work.So she applied for two administrative jobs in the private sector. They both pay better than her current position. They might lack job security, but federal government paychecks arenít reliable either these days. †ìIíve been with the government for 10 years, but if Iím offered a decent package, I would seriously consider taking it,î said Meskunas, 56. ìI donít want to go through this again.îFor workers like her, one of the most worrying effects of the record-setting partial government shutdown is the way in which itís making civil service less attractive. President Donald Trumpís demand that Congress provide $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has led to the furlough of 380,000 federal workers, and an additional 420,000 deemed ìexceptedî have been working without pay. The shutdown marked its 31st day Monday, making it at least 10 days longer than the previous record. Nine of 15 agencies and roughly a quarter of government functions are affected by the lapse in funding.If the Trump administration really wants to diminish the federal workforce, a prolonged and painful shutdown could help toward that goal. Whether theyíre longtime civil servants or relatively new to the government workforce, many federal employees feel less secure and less valued each day theyíre locked out of their jobs.The uncertainty could easily lead many of the most productive employees to leave government for other work or could discourage some of the brighter prospects from ever applying. ìWeíre going to see the fallout from this for a while,î Meskunas predicted.Grinding away at federal job security has been a hallmark of the Trump administration. Last year the White House issued a handful of executive orders aimed at weakening collective bargaining rights and making it easier to fire government workers. Key portions of those orders were blocked by a federal judge. The administration has also sought a pay freeze for civilian federal employees, resetting an automatic across-the-board raise to zero, and considered cutting federal worker pensions.Trump called federal employees working without pay ìgreat patriotsî on Sunday. But he also insulted furloughed workers last week, even as many are forced to seek loans from family members or accept food giveaways to feed their children. He retweeted a column from The Daily Caller, attributed to an anonymous Trump official, arguing that the shutdown is a good thing because the majority of federal workers donít do anything.ìWe do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them,î the author wrote. Trump retweeted his son†Donald Trump Jr., who called the article ìworth the read.îTo the unions representing federal employees, it often feels as if the Trump administration is at war with its own workforce. Despite their middle-class wages, federal workers have found themselves lumped in with the Washington ìswampî that needs draining. Never mind that most federal workers donít even live in the D.C. area.ìThey know that this administration is hostile to them and their work,î said Jacque Simon, the political director at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 federal employees. Even so, she said she is not overly worried about workers being discouraged from entering civil service, despite the current uncertainties.ìOne thing Iím continually impressed by is the depth of commitment,î she said. ìA lot of our members are veterans. Thereís a strong public service ethos. And as far as young people coming into government, thereís always going to be people who care about the public good.îThe sense of public service is part of what attracted Rick Fernandes to government work. An Army veteran who served in Iraq, he said he made excellent money selling insurance but decided to seek out a stable federal job instead. He took a vast pay cut when he accepted a position with the Interior Department in Nevada. He figured the job security and sense of purpose could make up for the loss in salary.ìI noticed in the private sector many people were losing their jobs and not necessarily because they were bad employees,î said Fernandes, 33. ìIf you were looking for security and longevity, [the federal government] is probably one of the last institutions for that, other than the military.î After just a year and three months on the job, he has experienced three government shutdowns already. The first, last January, lasted three days, and the second, in February, just a few hours. Like the current one, both of those were due to lapses in government funding. Even though they were short-lived, those shutdowns still diverted federal agencies from their core missions by forcing them to develop contingency plans and prep for furloughs.The current shutdown has made clear to Fernandes that his livelihood will be used as leverage in political fights. Without any savings, he might have to seek a second job in order to be prepared for more shutdowns. ìI was always reassured by more tenured employees that [shutdowns] only last a couple days. Ö I thought a week or so, at most,î he said. ìIt makes me wonder if government service is as resilient as itís believed to be. This shutdown proves itís not as stable as most people think.îAs the shutdown nears the one-month mark, it still isnít obvious how it will come to an end. Trump has offered to restore protections for certain undocumented immigrants and refugees after previously moving to restrict them but is still demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Most Democrats quickly dismissed that offer, insisting that Trump agree to reopen shuttered agencies before bargaining over border security.Meanwhile, furloughed workers like Meskunas are at home tracking the news closely, waiting for any sign of a breakthrough to get them back on the job. At least until the next shutdown, anyway. ìItís wearying,î she said. ìItís like when the sea erodes the beach. You just feel like you lose a little more of yourself every time it happens.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

But he noted that Sundayís absence rate was the highest the agency has seen since the current lapse in appropriations began on Dec. 22.TSA workers are among the 420,000 federal employees working without pay while President Donald Trump is gridlocked with Democrats over funding for his border wall.†Many TSA workers live paycheck to paycheck, earning starting salaries of $25,000 to $30,000 a year, as HuffPostís Nick Robins-Early reported. The last paycheck these critical federal employees received was on Dec. 28, leaving many scrambling to pay bills and seeking short-term loans to make ends meet.ìTo say morale is low is an understatement. People on both sides of the political argument are infuriated at this,î one TSA officer told HuffPost in December. ìWe feel completely and utterly unappreciated.îWorkers will likely receive back pay after the government reopens, but there is still no clear indication of when that will happen. On Monday, Trump offered to trade temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, for the $5.7 billion he has demanded for a border wall <U+2015> a proposal that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) equated to ìhostage taking.î†Despite the high number of unscheduled absences, the TSA said most of the 1.78 million passengers it screened on Sunday experienced waits of less than 30 minutes.

But I donít care,î said†Anpetu Luta Hoksila, who requested he be referred to by his given Indian name so he wouldnít get in trouble at work.†ìGenerally people know, if youíre up to date on current events, that this is fucked up, right?îIHS health care providers all over the country are bracing for their first missed paychecks on Friday <U+2015> and the reality that they have to keep working anyway. Thatís because employees like Anpetu Luta Hoksila are considered ìexcepted,î meaning they wonít get paid during the shutdown, but they are also considered ìessentialî because the care they provide is vital to IHS services.†The agency provides health care to nearly 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through 45 hospitals and nearly 300 clinics in 35 states.HuffPost tried to get an exact number for how many IHS health care providers will stop getting paid this week but are still expected to work. An IHS spokesman, who was working despite being furloughed, said he is trying to track down that information.Itís too early to know how severely the IHS funding freeze will hurt health care services to tribes. But itís already taking a toll. One urban IHS health care provider said morale has plummeted at her clinic in Michigan,†where employees live paycheck to paycheck and are scared. A tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michiganís Upper Peninsula is mulling its own furloughs and pared-back health services. A nonprofit based in Boston and Baltimore that contracts with IHS expects to run out of money this week, and is looking at layoffs and suspended medical and mental health services.That IHS has even stopped sending money to tribes raises serious questions about the U.S. government not meeting its treaty obligations. The federal government is obligated to provide health care services to tribes because of treaties negotiated generations ago in exchange for huge swaths of land. IHS is funded by the Interior appropriations bill, though it is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. As long as IHS funding is cut off, the government appears to be in violation of tribesí treaty rights.ìIn a roundabout way, they can say they are providing care. But the people that provide the health care are not getting paid to do so,î said one nurse practitioner who works at an IHS medical facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely.ìWe have psychologists, psychiatrists, a plethora of people who provide care,î she continued. ìThey can only maintain working without pay for a certain period. People will start dropping out. Theyíre going to have to find another job because they canít pay rent. I have enough for two months. Thatís it.îSeveral of the health care providers who talked to HuffPost said the shutdown marks another chapter in the governmentís abysmal treatment of tribes. Native Americans suffer from many illnesses and diseases at rates several times higher than the overall U.S. population. IHS also has a long history of being underfunded. And the same federal policies that led to the creation of IHS <U+2015> disenfranchising marginalized and indigenous people <U+2015> are driving President Donald Trumpís insistence on building a wall along the border.ìTheyíre depressing our ability to provide health care to indigenous people while also trying to keep indigenous people out,î said Anpetu Luta Hoksila, who is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. ìSo itís like, Iím a brown person trying to serve brown people while weíre also trying to cause harm to other brown people. On a number of levels, itís really fucked up. Thatís the only way I can put it.îDr. James McAuley, the clinical director of Whiteriver Indian Hospital in Arizona, said he expects his staff of about 40 nurses and physicians to work without pay for as long as they can because people in health care ìare generally altruistic.î But he is bracing for low morale and stories of financial hardship. His hospital is on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and serves about 17,000 Native Americans.ìGenerally, the public probably perceives physicians wonít suffer. But we have young people just out of residency, with big student loans <U+2015> theyíll have to make deferrals on those,î said McAuley. ìMore worrisome is what happens with support staff, who are making far less and supporting family members.îìI think our local churches are anticipating a need to step in,î he added.Small tribes in rural areas will be hit the hardest by the IHS funding freeze. Some rely entirely on federal funding for all of their services, and others donít have a single clinic on their reservation. That requires people to commute, sometimes an hour or more, to a remote IHS facility that will now be struggling to operate because of the government shutdown.Monica Brady, the finance director for the Yomba Shoshone Tribe in northern Nevada, said thatís the situation with this tribe. It doesnít have a clinic or generate its own income. Members of the community rely heavily on public transportation to get to their medical appointments.ìThatís my biggest concern: We need these programs back up and running to transport our elders to and from their appointments,î said Brady, who expressed frustration that there hasnít been more news coverage of the shutdownís effects on rural tribes. ìDo people realize that not every reservation in the nation has a casino?îBrady, whose husband is a member of the tribe, was the only person in the tribeís administrative office when HuffPost called. It usually has 22 people in it. But she and all of her colleagues have been furloughed, and many are applying for unemployment.ìWeíre just muddling along until we know what we can do,î she said. ìIím trying to make sure Iím here a few days a week, just to make sure someone is answering any calls.îPaulette Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for governor and two-term state legislator, is a member of the Coeur díAlene tribe in rural Idaho. She said her tribeís health care services are fine for now because it relies less on federal money than some other tribes. But sheís worried about what a prolonged shutdown could mean.ìWe live in health care deserts,î she said. ìIf our health clinics close up shop on reservations in rural communities, it poses a major threat to Native people who have been subject to governmental genocide for generations and are now left with increased demands for urgent and chronic care.îBigger tribes that generate significant money from casinos, like the Cherokee Nation, can pull from their general fund and get by for a longer period. The Cherokee Nation manages its own major hospital and eight health centers, and blends its own money with IHS money.ìFor now, weíre able to protect the Cherokee people,î said Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin. ìNot all tribes in the country are so blessed. We need to remember that. But even as strong as Cherokee Nation is, weíre not invulnerable to the effects of a long-term shutdown.îHoskin lamented that Congress has failed to carry out the most basic responsibilities of government, like balancing a budget and funding the government. Itís bad for the country, No. 1, he said, and itís bad for tribes.Despite Hoskinís reassurances, some of his tribeís members are scared about what the shutdown could mean for ailing family members. Amanda Clinton, his spokeswoman, tweeted that sheís afraid the freeze in IHS funding could affect care for her father, who began undergoing chemo to treat cancer.My dad recently began chemo for lymphoma. We just found out he may also have congestive heart failure. Because @IHSgov is stupidly under @Interior & theyíre #shutdown, can we stop talking about trash at parks & start talking about how ppl like my dad could die if this continues?For the moment, there are no signs of a deal for fully reopening the federal government. Trump and Democratic leaders continue to clash on the presidentís demand for $5.7 billion to build his wall along the Mexican border.In the meantime, for tribal health care providers trying to hang on without pay, it makes an already infuriating situation even worse when the†president claims that affected workers support keeping the government closed until he gets his wall money.ìWhen I hear Trump say something like, ë100 percent of federal workers not receiving a paycheck agree with my stance that we should have a resolution for wall funding,í it really bothers me,î said Anpetu Luta Hoksila. ìBecause here we are, unfunded without a resolution for our budget appropriations for this year, and it kills me to hear that.îìI donít want your fucking wall and I want to get paid for my work,î he added.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Itís estimated that hundreds of thousands if not millions of government-contracted workers were also affected. Though federal employees are expected to receive back pay, contracted employees likely will not.ìUnderlying those effects on the overall economy are much more significant effects on individual businesses and workers,î the CBO report stated. ìAmong those who experienced the largest and most direct negative effects are federal workers who faced delayed compensation and private-sector entities that lost business. Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost income.îNational Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on Monday said he disagrees with the CBOís assessment of the shutdownís economic impacts, though did not provide any specific numbers.ìWe frequently disagree with CBO,î Kudlow said during a White House press briefing. ìWith all respect, theyíre doing the best job they can. I get that. No, I wonít acknowledge any of that right now.îHe added, ìI think you have just a whole bunch of very temporary factors and now that the government has reopened, the switch goes right back on. Thereís certainly no permanent damage to the economy.îPresident Donald Trump on Friday announced a deal with congressional leaders to reopen the government for at least three weeks while lawmakers debate funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have steadfastly refused to support a spending bill that would include $5.7 billion toward the wall, which he repeatedly vowed Mexico would pay for.The government fully reopened again on Monday, though the president has pledged to the shut it down again or declare a national emergency to secure funds for the wall if Democrats donít cave to his demands by Feb. 15.†House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the CBOís report confirmed the shutdown had†ìa debilitating effect on our entire economy.îìIf it were to resume in three weeks, millions of Americans would again share the pain of the 800,000 workers who spent the past month without a paycheck,î he said in a statement Monday. ìThis CBO estimate serves as a stark warning to President Trump on the consequences of using American workers as a bargaining chip.î†Private estimates of the economic impact of a 16-day shutdown in 2013 put the economic damage at $20 billion or more, though that funding lapse affected more agencies.This story has been updated with Kudlowís comments.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The shutdown will have some lasting damage.††For one thing, some federal contract employees wonít get back pay. While Congress routinely approves back pay for federal workers during shutdowns, people who work for companies that provide services <U+2015> such as thousands of janitors and security officers who work in federal buildings <U+2015> donít receive the same consideration.†For another, millions of Americans will have to stretch their food budgets. The federal government ordered states to distribute Februaryís food benefit payments several weeks early because of the shutdown. More than 38 million Americans receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and theyíll now have to wait until March for their next payment. Some beneficiaries may have already spent the February allotment, thinking it was some kind of accidental bonus.†States had to rush to get the money out and didnít have time to focus on informing beneficiaries. Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, said she heard stories about confused SNAP recipients from several organizations in her state.†ìThey thought that because of the shutdown, if they didnít spend them all now the government is going to take them back,î Hamler-Fugitt said.†Hundreds of people in subsidized housing received eviction threats because nobody in the federal government could tell their landlords the program hadnít lapsed.

It was the kind of thing that normally would have been a routine reminder. But this week, it filled her with dread because she doesnít have the money to buy them.†Jojo,†who requested to be referred to just by her nickname because she and her fellow employees were told not to speak to the press,†is one of about 420,000 U.S. federal employees†currently working without pay. Another 380,000 employees are furloughed due to the record-setting partial government shutdown, which started on Dec 22.Jojo is a corrections officer at a federal prison in Texas and is the sole earner of her household. Her husband stays home to care for their two sons, who are 3 and 4. The boys both have autism, are non-verbal and recently aged out of home services.†After missing at least one paycheck, many federal workers canít pay for basics like†food and medication†and are taking desperate measures to get those items. Affording diapers, a costly expense even for families earning paychecks, has become a particularly difficult problem. Going without them isnít an option and there are no federal government programs that offer them.ìI canít not change them. They canít survive like that,î Jojo told HuffPost. ìYou have to take care of the little ones. You donít want to jeopardize their health and wellness.îJojo earns about $2,000 a month, and the family has been living paycheck-to-paycheck since they had children. In addition to their everyday expenses, they pay for special twice-weekly therapy services for their boys. Insurance covers most of the cost, but the family is required to pay $30 for every session. Because Jojoís job doesnít offer paid maternity leave, she had to take a few unpaid weeks off each time, during which she accrued $6,000 in credit card debt that sheís still paying off.Diapers cost her about $120 a month, and Jojo couldnít afford to pay her mortgage or car note bills this month, either.Jojo was relieved to learn from a friend that she could turn to the Texas Diaper Bank to get some help. The San Antonio-based nonprofit is a two-hour drive from her house, but even after accounting for fuel costs, she said making the trek is still financially worthwhile. The group is offering six monthsí worth of diapers and wipes to government employees and contractors affected by the shutdown. Jojo plans to make the drive on Wednesday after she finishes her eight-hour shift at work.While the Texas Diaper Bank currently has the resources to provide extra supplies to government employees who may be seeking help for the first time, demand could very well exceed capacity,†said Ashley Hernandez, program manager at the nonprofit. The group typically supports 20 families a day. On Tuesday alone, after announcing that it was extending help to families affected by the shutdown, the organization gave out diapers to about 25 families, and more calls are coming in. Itís likely that many nonprofits, especially those that provide diapers, simply donít have the resources to meet this kind of additional demand, said Joanne Goldblum, CEO and founder of the National Diaper Bank Network.ìNonprofits donít have more money because thereís a shutdown,î Goldblum said. ìIt impacts and pushes on the resources of organizations that are already straining to meet the needs of people who rely on them on a day-to-day basis.îThe National Diaper Bank Network comprises more than 200 local diaper banks that follow a similar model to that of food banks. The local agencies provide diapers, wipes, feminine hygiene products and services to struggling families. Goldblum said the organization has seen a noticeable uptick in need since the shutdown, particularly among Coast Guard families and communities in the greater Washington, D.C., area, where there are high levels of federal employment. Although the network distributes about 52 million diapers a year, itís still not enough. In Connecticut alone, the diaper bank gives out around 1 million diapers a year, according to Goldblum.Other diaper-specific groups and general nonprofits say theyíre overwhelmed with requests for diapers from federal employees right now.†The Cloth Option, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that just launched at the beginning of this month, provides reusable diapers. Since announcing on Facebook this week that its services are available to federal employees, the group has gotten a steady stream of applications, said Sadie Cora, chair of the groupís board of directors.One application that stuck out to Cora was from a mother who has four children and is pregnant with her fifth. Her husband was furloughed and she said in her request that she was ìscaredî because she had no idea when they were going to see a paycheck again.†ìThis is real for people,î Cora said.†The Massachusetts Military Support Foundation,†which provides aid to military personnel based in Massachusetts, said it can barely keep up with demand. It set up five pop-up pantries for Coast Guard families affected by the shutdown. In Rhode Island and Boston, the group went through three monthsí worth of diapers in two weeks, said Don Cox, the foundationís president. Cox said his organization is spending about six times what it normally spends per week to meet the needs of these military families. While the families are grateful for the help, theyíre also weighed down by stress, Cox said. ìIf you didnít get paid, and you had your Christmas bills, and your car insurance was due and you werenít sure when next paycheck was coming in, how would you feel?î he asked.While these organizations are providing crucial services, many families might not even be aware that theyíre available. Others might not live anywhere near an agency and may be forced to take desperate measures as a result.Teremy Henriquez,†a furloughed federal employee who works for the Department of Agriculture in Puerto Rico,†has a 1-year-old son. Sheís running low on diapers and has been keeping her child home from daycare to more closely monitor how many diapers he goes through and make them last a little longer. Itís a last resort for a lot of struggling families: Rationing diapers can lead to diaper rash and other health risks.Jojo is grateful that her situation hasnít come to that. But she has plenty of other things to worry about right now.†As the bills continue to pile up, sheís considering where she can pick up another job, possibly at a nearby McDonaldís.ìI was raised to go get a good job and support my family, in order to live a happy and healthy life,î Jojo said. ìI went out and got a good job to support my family <U+2015> to allow them to be happy and healthy and not worry. Now, Iím worried.îHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it. If youíre willing to be interviewed, please provide a phone number."

But the president made no mention of it in his State of the Union address Tuesday night.The partial government shutdown lasted 35 days, affecting about 800,000 federal workers <U+2015> in addition to thousands of federal contractors. Government employees missed two paychecks, with many wondering how they would pay for essentials like food, medicine and housing. They looked for new jobs, turned to relatives and friends for temporary loans and went to food pantries.†The shutdown occurred because Trump insisted that Congress give him $5.7 billion to build a wall on the countryís southern border, even though he once promised that Mexico would pay for that barrier. Democrats refused to go along with his demand and said he should simply fund the government and argue about immigration later. He refused.†On Jan. 25, Trump caved and signed a bill funding the government for three weeks. He has insisted that if he doesnít get his money for a wall by Feb. 15, he may declare a national emergency allowing him to build it anyway.†Trump never mentioned what federal workers went through during his speech Tuesday night. He expressed no remorse for the shutdown, and he didnít promise that it wouldnít happen again. The closest he came to referencing the shutdown was in urging Congress to fund the border wall when passing legislation to fund the government beyond Feb. 15.†ìCongress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland and secure our southern border,î he said. ìNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers out of business.îEven Trumpís State of the Union address was affected by the shutdown. It was supposed to occur on Jan. 29, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) canceled it <U+2015> she has that power since the president delivers it in the Capitol <U+2015> and said they would discuss a new date only after the government reopened.†Trumpís approach is a break from what President Bill Clinton did in 1996, after what had previously been the longest shutdown ever. In his State of the Union speech that year, Clinton honored a heroic public servant who had been furloughed because of the shutdown. He then warned Congress to remember the pain of the shutdown when legislating in the future.†ìOn behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people,î Clinton said. ìI challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.îIn the Democratic response to Trumpís address Tuesday night, Stacey Abrams <U+2015> who ran for governor of Georgia <U+2015> did address the shutdown.†ìJust a few weeks ago, I joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers. They waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they hadnít received a paycheck in weeks.

Annette Cowen manages 50 properties in Arkansas, mostly apartment buildings for low-income tenants with government-subsidized rent. She said her usual federal contact got furloughed when several agencies shut down last month, so she had nobody to tell her if the government would pay its share this month. So last week she sent her tenants some upsetting letters. ìDue to the shutdown of the federal government, your rental assistance portion of your rent is not being paid,î Cowen said in her letter. ìAs of now, you have no rental assistance and your rent must be paid prior to January 20th or eviction procedures may begin against you.îIt turned out to be a false alarm. This week Cowen said she finally talked to an official who said she would still receive payments for the governmentís portion of her tenantsí January rent. She said they would all get new, more reassuring letters. But the eviction threat may be a picture of whatís to come if the shutdown continues. Cowenís tenants are beneficiaries of a little-known U.S. Department of Agriculture housing initiative that is essentially a rural counterpart to the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentís much larger programs. And those programs could be severely affected if the shutdown goes on for months or years, as President Donald Trump has said it might. The housing agency has already said itís unable to renew some contracts with landlords in its Section 8 project-based rental assistance program, which supports 1.4 million households. Under the program, HUD contracts with private building owners to set aside at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families, including seniors and people with disabilities. The shutdown has prevented the agency from renewing 1,150 contracts, affecting more than 40,000 households. An additional 2.2 million households use a different kind of Section 8 voucher that is portable, meaning families use it to find landlords on their own. That program is funded until March.Spokespersons for HUD have not responded to requests for comment about whether it would be legal for landlords to evict tenants because of the governmentís failure to pay. The department has asked landlords to dip into their own reserve funds to meet expenses if necessary. It has said shutdown evictions have never happened before. But it has not informed tenants about how the shutdown could possibly affect them.†For the tenant-based voucher program, HUD regulations do not allow for landlords to evict tenants in the event that the government fails to pay its share. And the regulation doesnít allow landlords to charge tenants for what the government isnít paying. ìDuring the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the [public housing authorityís] housing assistance payment,î the regulation says.Section 8 beneficiaries are typically required to devote 30 percent of their income to rent, with the subsidy making up the rest. If the shutdown drags on, and landlords start going broke, itís possible they could try to justify evictions based on another part of the regulation. It says owners can evict tenants for business or economic reasons, îsuch as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental.îThe partial government shutdown, in its fourth week, is already the longest in history. Housing policy experts say landlords can only hold on for so long before they run out of money too.ìThis is uncharted territory,î Michael Kane, executive director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, told HuffPost. He said the Section 8 system will ìstart to break downî as the shutdown continues, and building owners will be forced to eventually shift costs to tenants.Itís not clear if the regulation prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants with portable Section 8 vouchers also applies to project-based vouchers or to USDAís rural housing assistance programs. Some members of Congress said they didnít think any evictions would be legal. ìThereís no way that they can evict anybody,î Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), the chairman of the House committee that oversees the USDA, said in reference to the Arkansas situation. The USDA told HuffPost this week that rural rental assistance is fully funded for January, but didnít say anything about the following months. Panic and confusion over a given programís status are the essential byproducts of a government shutdown. In 2011, for instance, the mere threat of a shutdown prompted a social services agency in Washington, D.C., to warn more than 100 elderly residents that they would lose their next home-delivered meal. The shutdown ultimately didnít happen.†The Arkansas situation got resolved thanks partly to media attention. Local TV stations did stories on the eviction threat, and HuffPost and NBCNews followed up. One resident, a 76-year-old retiree named Jerald McLelland, said he had no idea how he would pay his full rent. ìIíll have to call the finance people that my finances my car and see if they will extend my payment and I will have to take that money to pay the rent <U+2015> thatís the only way I can do it,î McLelland told the local ABC affiliate. Cowen said that because the government had shut down, she believed her agreement with USDA to house subsidized tenants was no longer in effect. There was nobody to tell her otherwise.†ìThese complexes are not designed to make money, only to try to break even on a yearly basis. This is done in order to keep the rents as low as possible,î Cowen said in an email. ìIf the government does not open soon, my management company will have to send my employees home and my maintenance people that maintain these complexes because there will not be funds to pay the employees.îThe USDA official who contacted Cowen this week, Cowen said, did so because there had been several inquiries from members of Congress, and presumably the news coverage had something to do with it. ìWe wouldnít allow that to happen,î Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said Thursday of the eviction threats. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) walked away from a request for comment in a Senate hallway.†The partial shutdown isnít anywhere near a resolution, and the threat to housing assistance is just one of many mounting problems. An estimated 800,000 federal employees have already missed paychecks. More than half of them have been deemed essential and have to keep working without pay. But President Donald Trump has been steadfast in his demand that Congress appropriate $5 billion for 200 miles of wall (or fence) along a border that already has nearly 700 miles of barriers. Democrats havenít budged an inch, pointing out that Trump has repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for the wall. If the shutdown goes on for another several weeks, it will begin to interfere not only with housing assistance but also the tax filing season and food benefits for tens of millions. And Cowen will be right back where she was last week. ìThe president says heís prepared for the shutdown to go on months, even years,î Cowen said. ìMy concern is, where am I going to get money?îHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

A second shutdown threatens to kick in Feb. 15 if Congress canít cut a deal on President Donald Trumpís demand for money to build a border wall.However, labor advocates think they have the answer on how to end government shutdowns.†During the final week of the shutdown, sickouts spiked among federal employees who refused to show up for work, leaving staffing shortages, triggering airport delays and raising concerns over whether tax refunds would be processed on time.Meanwhile, there were indications of growing support for coordinated absences even as thousands of staffers were being encouraged to work without pay.Last week, former Clinton-era Secretary of Labor Robert Reich who was also temporarily an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, publicly urged employees to stop showing up to their jobs in protest.As a former secretary of labor, I urge federal workers who continue to toil without pay to stop working and those who are furloughed to picket their workplaces. Trump's callous disregard for all of you and for the public welfare must end. He must reopen the U.S. government.Joseph McCartin, a professor and director of Georgetown Universityís Kalmanovitz Institute for Labor and the Working Poor, told Voice of America, a government-financed news outlet, that the strategy could work.ìIt would be about getting public attention, and even more important, causing the government to focus on this problem,î he said. ìAnd hopefully, to delink the payment of wages to federal workers from the dispute that exists over the border.îIn an American Prospect Op-Ed published less than two weeks before, McCartin had pushed for workers to act, writing, ìA sickout by unpaid federal employees could bring the impasse ó and their status as hostages to the presidentís whim ó to an end.îDocumentarian Michael Moore promoted the tactic in his Friday appearance on Stephen Colbertís ìLate Show.îìThereís an easy way to end it,î he said of the shutdown. ìFederal workers <U+2015> donít go to work without pay.îMoore stressed that ìwe shouldnít be supporting anything that requires someone whoís not paid working for us,î telling the audience to avoid flying and filing tax returns, suggesting they opt for extensions instead so as to avoid the need for workers.The day after Mooreís appearance, the agreement to reopen the government was announced.While the future of government operations and Trumpís border wall remain unclear, Democrats and Republicans have until Feb. 15 to find a solution before key parts of the government could again grind to a halt."

Just over†one-quarter of Americans say that theyíve been personally affected by the shutdown or that they expect to be affected in the future. What they mean by that varies dramatically in scope and impact. For some, itís meant simply long lines at the airport or increased concerns about food safety; others have been plunged into acute financial distress by the shutdown, or are trying to help their friends and family make ends meet. But weeks into the partial shutdown, the ripple effects are increasingly clear. ìEveryone is affected at this point,î summarized one Ohio woman who answered the survey. ìPeople not being paid means they donít buy, which means creditors and retailers donít have income, which means they canít pay their employees, and so on.

Americans are 42 points likelier to disapprove than approve of the way Congress has handled the shutdown. By smaller margins, they also disapprove of congressional Republicans (-23), Trump (-17), congressional Democrats (-15) and their own representatives (-9).†A 57 percent majority say Trump is at least partially responsible for the shutdown, a number thatís unchanged from last weekís survey. Forty-five percent name Democrats in Congress and 38 percent Republicans in Congress.†Just 33 percent believe Trump is making a good-faith effort to end the shutdown rather than playing politics, with 34 percent saying the same of congressional Democrats, and 29 percent of congressional Republicans.Americans say, 50 percent to 35 percent, that Trump should have compromised on the border wall in order to prevent gridlock. Another 15 percent say they arenít sure.A review of other polling released in the past week finds Americans continuing to hold the president largely responsible for the impasse. Hereís what some of them have found:Pew Research: ì[B]oth opponents and supporters of expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall overwhelmingly oppose making concessions to end the stalemate ...†Overall opinion on the wall is little changed from last year, but these views have never been more sharply divided along partisan lines.îEconomist/YouGov: ìAs the partial government shutdown moves towards the end of its fourth week, the conflict between the Republican President and the Democrats in Congress is not one President Trump is winning Ö The [p]resident has been unable to convince most Americans that the wall is the best way to protect the country, or that a crisis on the border requires that he declare a national emergency in order to build a wall.îQuinnipiac University: ìAmerican voters support 63 - 30 percent a Democratic proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security while negotiating funding for the [wall] ... The government shutdown has little effect on President Donald Trumpís job approval rating as American voters give him a negative 41 - 55 percent score, compared to a negative 39 - 52 percent approval rating December 19, before the shutdown.îPBS NewsHour/Marist: ìConvincing Americans that the government shutdown is an effective tool to bring about consensus on border security is a tough sell for President Donald Trump.îReuters/Ipsos: ìMore than half of Americans blame U.S. President Donald Trump for the partial federal government shutdown, despite his repeatedly faulting Democratic lawmakers.îMorning Consult/Politico: ìAs the partial government shutdown enters its 26th day, a new survey suggests Democrats are winning the messaging battle when it comes to whom voters blame Ö 49 percent said they mostly blamed the president for the ongoing impasse, which has resulted in the shuttering of roughly one-fourth of the federal government. That figure is up 6 percentage points.îPublic Policy Polling (D): ìThe shutdown situation is not doing anything to help Trumpís cause. Only 35% of voters agree with Trump that the government should be kept closed until he gets funding for the wall to 60% who disagree.îThe Hill/HarrisX: ìAn overwhelmingly 70 percent of registered voters in the latest The Hill-HarrisX poll said they want Trump and Congress to reach some sort of compromise, compared to just 30 percent who say that sticking to principles is more important than ending the partial shutdown. The poll found that while Trumpís most fervent supporters approve of refusing to bend, no other demographic group did.îGallup: ìAs the federal government continues the longest shutdown in its history, Americans are most likely to cite ëthe government/poor leadershipí (29%) as the most important problem facing the country.îHuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

The bill also aims to make Election Day a paid holiday for federal workers, which McConnell dismissed as a ìgenerous new benefitî for ìfederal bureaucrats.î In theory, that proposal would encourage private businesses to also make Election Day a holiday, allowing more people to get to the polls. McConnell also suggested that making private donors public was an attack on free speech.ìApparently the Democrats define ëdemocracyí as giving Washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate and leaving citizens more vulnerable to public harassment over private views,î McConnell wrote.The Republican also took issue with the billís ban on removing people from voter rolls for not voting in a previous election, as well as a ban on voter caging, a practice in which election officials send non-forwardable mail to addresses on the voter rolls, then remove anyone whose mail is returned to sender. McConnell pointed to a mistake made in California that led to 23,000 voters being registered incorrectly, with errors including wrong party preferences.However, linking that part of the bill to the mishap in California is misleading, according to HuffPostís voting rights reporter Sam Levine. ìIt was an issue with software, and the head of the DMV resigned,î Levine noted on Twitter. ìFor context, there are over 19.6 million registered voters in CA.

Those furloughed workers, along with 420,000 federal employees who were required to report to work during the shutdown, went 35 days without pay while Trump sparred with congressional Democrats over $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.†ìIím humbled and honored to share that I will be representing federal workers at the State of the Union as the guest of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren,î Shahriar said in a statement.Sen.

The familyís home burned down in the 2017 Thomas fire.ìSince the tragic loss of their home, Trisha, Jed, and their three children have worked diligently to bounce back and reestablish a sense of normalcy in their lives, even amidst an unnecessary government shutdown that caused both of them to miss their paychecks for over a month,î Harris said in a statement.Rep.

Lagunas works as a project manager for the EPAís Superfund division and was furloughed during the recent shutdown.ìI want to show President Trump how his hostage-taking of American workers has a continuing impact on the lives of every day citizens, especially those who are dedicated to the public good,î Schakowsky said in a release.Trump is set to deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday night.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had earlier asked him to postpone the speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, until the shutdown was over.†When he initially refused to do so, she said she would not take the necessary steps to allow the address to proceed.†After Trump†announced a plan†on Jan. 25 to reopen the government for three weeks, Pelosi invited him to deliver the address on Feb. 5.If he doesnít get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.Pesiri-Dybvik said in a statement that federal workers feel added stress because of ìthe looming uncertainty of another potential shutdown.îIn his announcement about reopening the government, Trump promised that federal employees who had been affected by the shutdown would get backpay ìvery quickly or as soon as possible.îBut workers like Lila Johnson,†a general cleaning services contractor at the Department of Agriculture, probably wonít see any lost wages. Many government contractors <U+2015> from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers <U+2015> were also furloughed or received stop-work orders during the shutdown.

It would make it easier to deport Central American children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents. It would expand Immigration and Customs Enforcementís detention and deportation budget by more than 20 percent.Perhaps most galling, it didnít even offer a better deal for Dreamers than the status quo, even though concessions on that issue were hyped as the compromise that would bring Democrats to the shutdown negotiating table. Under the draft bill,†recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection could apply for a new program with stricter requirements that would offer similar deportation protection and work authorization, but that would permanently expire three years later.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is set to bring this legislation up for a pointless vote on Thursday. The measure is all but certain to fail in the Senate and would be impossible to pass in the House.ìItís beyond poisoned pills <U+2015> they didnít even try,î Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services, told HuffPost. ìThereís not even an iota of effort to come up with a compromise. Itís shocking.îWhen Trump unilaterally canceled DACA in September 2017, many observers assumed that he did so in order to give himself leverage to demand concessions†from Democrats related to immigration and border security <U+2015> like funding for a U.S.-Mexico wall, for example. Holding the security of 700,000 Dreamers hostage in order to fulfill his controversial campaign promise does have a certain logic to it.Events since his DACA strike have undermined Trumpís position somewhat. Multiple federal judges have temporarily blocked the programís cancellation and so far the Supreme Court has refused to fast-track its consideration of the injunctions that allow Dreamers to keep renewing their DACA protections <U+2015> for now.Trump still has tremendous leverage when it comes to DACA. Having been created through executive action, the program can be reversed by hostile presidents who follow the law.†And the program is currently stuck in legal limbo. Supporters of immigration reform, including Dreamers themselves, have long demanded a permanent solution, ideally with a pathway to citizenship.But Trump is not a Machiavellian strategist, using the twin weapons of deception and terror to achieve his ends. Heís merely an obstructionist self-promoter for whom disaster is its own reward, as long as itís on brand.Thatís why he threatened to veto <U+2015> and thereby doomed <U+2015> a bill†last year that would have made DACA permanent and set out a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion in wall money. And thatís why the draft bill unveiled Monday night made an offer that the Democrats couldnít possibly accept.ìThis is so far away from a good faith effort,î said Philip Wolgin, the managing director for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. ìItís nowhere near ëLetís make a trade: DACA for the wall.íîSome observers casting about for signs that a rational mind in the White House might honestly be cooking up a solution to the problem of Trump refusing to sign a shutdown-ending bill without some wall money are now watching Jared Kushner. Trumpís son-in-law and adviser is trying to ìfigure out what bigger immigration reform looks like,î†including a possible ìpath to green cardsî for DACA recipients, according to an Axios report†on Wednesday.The phrase ìpath to green cardsî is another way of saying the more commonly heard ìpathway to citizenship,î albeit in a form that sounds less objectionable to hardline immigration restrictionists. Perhaps that bit of language trickery offers a small sign that the thinking in the White House is evolving.What is less encouraging about the Axios report is its portrayal of Kushner. He seems unaware that the solution heís considering as if it were novel is the same one that his father-in-law has already rejected multiple times.ìIf the president put up a bill with permanent protection for Dreamers for border security money, it would pass,î said Todd Schulte, president of the nonpartisan immigration advocacy group FWD.us and a major critic of Mondayís draft bill. ìIf the president wants money for the wall, he knows how to get it.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Without a joint session, the president wouldnít be able to come onto the House floor to deliver his address.The president can technically enter the House chamber at any time, but as McClatchy reporter Emma Dumain noted, there might not be anyone else there, let alone C-SPAN broadcasting or even lights.Trump could technically face censure or removal from the chamber if he decided to enter House and begin his address without express permission from Pelosi, according to House rules. But as Pacific Standard outlined, thereís no precedent for a president doing so against the wishes of the House speaker.Pelosi,†who became House speaker this month after Democrats won control of the chamber, extended the traditional invitation to Trump†on Jan. 3. Last week, she†asked Trump to delay the State of the Union speech until after the resolution of the government shutdown.Her request sparked heated debate between the president and congressional Democrats, and speculation about how Trump might respond.ìNancy Pelosi does not dictate to the president when he will or will not have a conversation with the American people,î White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Tuesday on Fox News.CNNís Jim Acosta, citing a senior White House official, reported Tuesday morning that Trump was considering delivering the address off-site, or even turning it into a rally.Trump could deliver his State of the Union away from the Capitol and might even do a rally, senior official confirms. ìContingencies need to be planned,î official says.ABC reported the president was preparing two addresses <U+2015> one to be delivered before Congress, and another to be presented at a political rally outside of Washington.The White House sent a letter to the House sergeant-at-arms requesting a walk-through ahead of the planned address, Fox News reported.Pelosiís office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The church purchased over 300 Publix gift cards from a local grocery store in $50 increments.†Within 30 minutes of opening the churchís doors on Thursday, all the gift cards were gone, Collins said.The pastor said he was moved by how many people had lined up that morning at his church to receive the cards.†ìThat was probably the most impactful moment,î he said. ìJust seeing that many people who have done the right thing, prepared for a job, got a job, worked at a job and for circumstances beyond their control, now theyíre in need of temporary assistance.î†Now in its fifth week, the partial government shutdown was triggered by disagreements between President Donald Trump, who is demanding more than $5 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and Democrats in Congress, who donít want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown has affected 800,000 federal workers, about 420,000 of whom must still report to work, even without being paid.†In Alabama,†nearly 40,000 federal employees have been affected by the shutdown,†The Washington Post reports.Collins said that many members of his congregation are NASA or Redstone Arsenal employees. First Baptist is a conservative evangelical congregation aligned with the†Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and the Southern Baptist Convention.Below, Collins invites furloughed workers to attend a charity event at First Baptist Church of Huntsville.The pastor emphasized that his church is just one of many local organizations helping federal workers during the partial shutdown. He said the idea for Thursdayís event came from workers at NASAís Marshall Space Flight Center who wanted to create an opportunity for local charities and businesses to connect with furloughed workers. As one of Huntsvilleís largest churches, First Baptist had the space to accommodate such an event.†Eighteen community organizations set up information booths in the church, including the local food bank, the Alabama Department of Labor and banks offering low-interest loans, CNN reports. At least 700 people attended the event, Collins said.†First Baptistís ministry staff are meeting on Monday to discuss future partnerships with community organizations helping furloughed workers, he said.ìOur only regret is that we didnít designate more money,î Collins said. ìWe had no idea how big the response would be.îAcross the country, other religious communities have pitched in to help federal employees affected by the shutdown. A church in Chula Vista, California, started a food bank for furloughed employees, and churches in Dallas†and Atlanta and a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee, offered gift cards. Muslim youth groups across the country organized volunteers to clean up national parks amid the shutdown.Collins said he sees First Baptistís donation as a ìnatural responseî to the crisis.ìItís kind of corny and all, but I think Jesus would be there giving away grocery cards or heíd be right there volunteering with any organization that is helping,î Collins said. ìSo itís not like weíre going above and beyond the call of duty.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Ted Cruzís campaign during the 2016 presidential primaries. ìSo the only thing to conclude is that Trump is building a fake wall with fake pesos to stop fake caravans to prevent a fake border crisis for which he will declare another fake victory.îThe president triggered a 35-day government shutdown just before Christmas over the refusal by the then wholly Republican-led Congress to appropriate billions of taxpayer dollars for his signature campaign promise.A week ago, he signed the exact short-term spending deal <U+2015> with no wall money <U+2015> that he said he would not sign in December. On Thursday, he said he did so to help the 800,000 federal workers who already had missed a month of pay. He claimed, without evidence, that ìmanyî of them had wanted him to continue the shutdown to get wall money.ìBut I didnít want to do it because people were getting hurt,î Trump told reporters following an Oval Office photo opportunity.He added that the shutdown had great value because it focused attention on the wall and illegal immigration. ìIf I didnít do the shutdown, people wouldnít know, people wouldnít understand the subject,î the president said. ìNow they understand the subject. They understand what a humanitarian crisis it is.îTrump has taken to blaming former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan for failing to get him funds for a wall during Trumpís first two years in the White House, when his own party controlled both chambers of Congress. ìI was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed,î he told the conservative website Daily Caller.But one former Trump campaign official said the president failed to take advantage of his first-year power when he had it. ìThe fact of the matter was itís his fault for not getting it in his first two years, when he had control of Congress. He can blame Paul Ryan all he wants,î the official said on condition of anonymity.Now, with the House under the control of Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is facing vocal opposition to his wall rather than just passive resistance. ìThereís not going to be any wall money in the legislation,î Pelosi said Thursday, but allowed that she is open to some new barriers in some areas as well as money for better technical monitoring. ìThatís part of the negotiation.îTrump made illegal immigration and caravans of asylum-seekers heading to the border the centerpiece of his midterm election message last year. In speech after speech, he told audiences at his rallies and those watching at home that the migrants would bring crime and drugs and that Pelosi wanted ìopen bordersî and would welcome those people in.Despite his efforts <U+2015> and in some congressional districts, because of them <U+2015> Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House. Meanwhile, Republicans, although they had the most favorable Senate election map in decades, picked up only two seats in that chamber.As a Dec. 21 government funding deadline approached, Trump resumed talking about caravans and immigrants coming to commit crimes <U+2015> including one particularly lurid but apparently apocryphal description of kidnapped women being bound and gagged with duct tape as theyíre smuggled across the border.On Thursday, Trump told reporters that he doubted the House and Senate conference committee negotiators working on a new Department of Homeland Security funding bill would include money for his wall. He acknowledged that he might yet declare a ìnational emergency,î which he believes would let him transfer money from other executive agency accounts to build the wall.ìIím waiting till Feb. 15,î Trump said, referring to the next shutdown deadline. ìOn Feb. 15, the committee will come back. And if they donít have a wall, I donít even want to waste my time reading what they have.îMedia reports from when Trump previously threatened to declare an emergency noted that he was thinking of raiding billions of dollars from the Defense Departmentís Army Corps of Engineers budget to repair hurricane damage in places like Puerto Rico and Houston.ìThose are not great ideas,î said Michael Steel, once a top aide to then GOP House Speaker John Boehner.Steel added that since Democrats seem willing to agree to money for some new physical barriers, he did not fully understand talk about an emergency or another shutdown.ìThe president can say, ëThis is a wall.í The Democrats can say, ëNo, it isnít.í And everyone lives to fight another day,î Steel said. ìIt shouldnít be hard.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) shot down the deal to extend protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration proposal as a ìnon-starter.îIn a statement issued before Trumpís speech, Pelosi said the idea was a ìcompilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to peopleís lives.îTrump, meanwhile, falsely presented the proposal as something he had worked out with Democrats.He said he thought many Democrats would show their ìenthusiastic support,î and he said his solution was a ìcompassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border.îBut the offer, which Trump made from the White Houseís Diplomatic Reception Room, seemed less like a serious effort to end the shutdown and more like his normal blame-shifting.In response to the speech, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said on MSNBC that Trumpís deal was a ìpipe dream,î and that Democrats would dismiss this speech as a publicity stunt.While the offer certainly doesnít seem to be a solution to the shutdown, it could potentially stir a new round of negotiations, and it signals Trumpís willingness to make some deal trading DACA protections for border security money.Trump also signaled that he has moved from his insistence of a 2,000-mile border wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border to a more targeted approach. He referenced a ìsee-through steel barrier,î also known as a ìfence.î He spoke of border security in broader terms, like in increasing the number of border agents. And he offered those trades for immigration <U+2015> specifically, three years of legislative relief for DACA recipients, and three years of protections for refugees.The Trump administration†has attempted to shut down DACA, an Obama-era initiative that allowed around 700,000 young people, called Dreamers, to avoid deportation. It has also sought to severely restrict TPS, which allows people to reside in the U.S. if they come from certain nations undergoing conflict or recovering from a natural disaster. But both would get a three-year extension under Trumpís offer.That proposal is likely to anger Trumpís far-right base, however. Conservative author Ann Coulter <U+2015> whom Trump has taken policy cues from in the past <U+2015> tweeted that Trumpís offer was ì100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals.îìSo if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall,î she said.Trump is also unlikely to move anyone on the left, but he and the White House are hoping thereís a strong group of independents who will see Trumpís effort to negotiate and begin blaming Democrats for the shutdown.Trump didnít spend time discussing the shutdown Saturday, but itís clear heís facing heat to get federal workers back to work. Polling suggests that 57 percent of Americans blame Trump for the shutdown, and his favorability has been slipping. But heís hoping he can at least convince some that heís working to find a solution <U+2015> even if his offer is one Democrats were able to easily reject.One thing Trump did intimate is that he still could use a national emergency declaration to get his border wall, or perhaps other statutes. Trump said he would get his border wall ìone way or the other.î That may offer Republicans and Democrats some hope, actually, as many on Capitol Hill believe the only way out of this shutdown is for Trump to declare a national emergency and try to redirect funds to a wall, have that move tied up in court, and then allow both parties to pass funding without giving in to the other side.The other option <U+2015> Republicans, Democrats and Trump actually working out a deal <U+2015> is both unlikely and unpalatable to many. But there are some lawmakers who think Trump could find a way out of the shutdown by making a grand deal on immigration.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been†urging the president to offer the Democrats protections for immigrants to end the shutdown for weeks. And by offering support for the Bridge Act on Saturday <U+2015> legislation Graham co-sponsored <U+2015> the White House would allow DACA recipients to obtain three-year work permits and extend the TPS protections.†But in a sign of the long odds such a deal would face, Grahamís co-sponsor of the Bridge Act, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), said in a statement that he could not support the presidentís offer and did not believe it could pass the Senate.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) supported reopening the government and starting border security negotiations.ìBut if we reward this behavior it will never end, and the pain and chaos will be worse in the future,î he wrote over Twitter.†If we open up the government I am open to negotiations. But if we reward this behavior it will never end, and the pain and chaos will be worse in the future. Let this be the last shutdown. They always backfire.Referencing an Axios report that Jared Kushner and Vice President Mike Pence led negotiations with Republican members of Congress, Schatz said in a later tweet: ìYou donít negotiate a compromise with your own Vice President and your son in law. Thatís not how this works.îAnd Pelosi has said members of her party would not support any spending package that included funds for the wall that Trump envisions. In December, she said Democrats largely consider the massive infrastructure project ìimmoral, ineffective, expensive.î†ìNothing for the wall,î the speaker reiterated in a Jan. 2 interview with the ìTodayî showís Savannah Guthrie.Pelosi has also rejected the idea of exchanging border wall funding for DACA protections, saying in December that ìtheyíre two different subjects.îLate last year, Democratic congressional leaders offered $1.6 billion for border security, to be used for technological improvements and fencing, but not the 30-foot-high structure proposed by Trump.†The partial government shutdown has affected roughly 800,000 federal employees, who started to miss paychecks earlier this month. Many have shared their financial anxieties with news media, with some saying they have missed rent payments or are struggling to afford diapers.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

That same year, he jokingly endorsed the lynching of journalists, which led some Hall of Fame voters to leave him off their ballot that year. In 2015, ESPN suspended Schilling for a tweet comparing Muslims to Nazis.To get into the Hall of Fame, Schilling will need to be named on 75 percent of all ballots. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame Tracker, Schilling is polling at around 71 percent of all the publicly released ballots and needs 162 more votes to make it.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He also discounted the scope of those affected by the shutdown, alluding that the number of people only represented a fraction of the nationís financial output.ìPut it in perspective: Youíre talking about 800,000 workers, and while I feel sorry for individuals who have hardship cases, 800,000 workers, if they never got their pay, which is not the case, they will eventually get it, but if they never got it, youíre talking about a third of a percent on our GDP. So itís not like itís a gigantic number overall.îRoss, who also suggested that workers could simply take out loans to cover their expenses, is worth an estimated $700 million.The pairís comments fall in stark contrast to widespread reports of federal employees struggling to make ends meet. Workers are expected to miss their second paycheck of the year on Friday after Congress failed to pass any legislation meant to end the shutdown this week. An end to the impasse still appears to be far off.The commerce secretaryís statements drew swift rebukes from congressional Democrats, who accused Ross of espousing the ì21st century equivalent of ëLet them eat cake.íîìMany federal employees live paycheck to paycheck,î Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday on the Senate floor. ìSecretary Ross, they just canít call their stockbroker and ask them to sell some of their shares.

The U.S. intelligence community has stated that the emails were stolen by Russian spy agencies and passed along to WikiLeaks for release.Trump spent the final month of the campaign praising WikiLeaks at his rallies and telling his supporters to read the emails ó even though the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence on Oct. 7 stated that WikiLeaks was acting in concert with Russia.ìWe love WikiLeaks!î Trump said frequently.Shortly before her speech, McDaniel said she had not read or seen any news coverage about Stoneís indictment and could not comment on it.

Bush and Barack Obama popularized the annual tradition of giving an on-air interview to a journalist from the network airing that yearís Super Bowl.Trump, who regularly attacks the media, has given few television interviews. He has typically chosen to speak with networks that tend to give him more generous coverage, such as Fox News.Trump taped an interview with†then-Fox News personality Bill OíReilly before the 2017 Super Bowl, and it aired on Foxís broadcast network as part of its telecast of the game. But last year, White House officials turned down the invitation from NBC, which Trump has frequently attacked.NBC News had last conducted a sit-down interview with Trump in May 2017,†after his abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey. Trump famously told anchor Lester Holt that he had considered ìthis Russia thingî†prior to making the decision. The interview raised questions about whether Trump had obstructed justice by firing Comey amid the FBIís investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia.Trump has turned the game into†red meat for his base by creating friction with the NFL, as he has regularly lashed out against players who have protested racism and police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem at games. Colin Kaepernick started the gesture in 2016, while he was with the San Francisco 49ers.The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!#StandForOurAnthemTrump famously said at a 2017 rally that NFL owners should ìget that son of a bitch off the field,î†referring to players who protest,†and called on NFL fans to boycott games.Obama participated in the pregame interview each year of his presidency, answering rapid-fire questions about the game and his familyís Super Bowl traditions, as well as topics in the news. Obama was interviewed by OíReilly in 2011 and 2014, with the latter exchange getting particularly heated."

New FBI recruits just starting their careers through their training at Quantico, Virginia, have never received a paycheck.†The FBI SWAT team canít purchase critical gear. Some FBI employees are unable to put food on the table and are relying on food banks that FBI field offices have set up across the country.†A new report from the FBI Agents Association, an outside organization that advocates for bureau employees, lays out the effects of the partial government shutdown on the Federal Bureau of Investigation.†Thomas OíConnor, the president of the group, held a press conference on Tuesday to call attention to the shutdownís impact on FBI employees and the need to fund the bureau.ìWe are a motivated, professional, and patriotic lot, as you know, but we do have to make our bills like every other American ó red, blue, green, or otherwise,î one 22-year FBI veteran said in the report. ìNotwithstanding the obvious ... financial duress, there is also a very real impact on morale for us all.îìThe demoralization of employees is impacting operations because employees now have a significant point of stress distracting them as they perform their normal duties,î said another FBI employee.An agent whose wife is battling Stage 2 breast cancer is worried about being able to financially survive the shutdown and said he was ìangry at the unnecessary stress this shutdown is putting on my wife who just survived cancer and my 9-year-old son.îTwo FBI employees who recently bought their first home in a new city canít afford their mortgage. ìWe contacted our lender, and they are refusing to work with us,î the FBI employee said. ìThey donít want our ëHardship Letter,í they want money, period.îAnother employee of 24 years whose wife is battling terminal cancer said theyíve had to reach out for assistance from family and friends for the first time in his career.ìI am proud to be an Agent, proud to serve my country, and willing to sacrifice my life in defense of the people and the Constitution, but to have my family placed in the financial situation we are currently facing due to partisan politics is disgusting to me as a government employee and a citizen,î the agent said in the report.†While President Donald Trump has used the threat of MS-13 as justification for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the shutdown has affected investigations into the gang, according to one FBI employee. The employee said the bureau had been working an investigation into MS-13 for three years and had indicted a number of members, but has not had a Spanish speaker in the division since the shutdown.ìWe have several Spanish speaking informants,î the employee said. ìWe are only able to communicate using a three-way call with a linguist in another division.îBureau employees are limited in what kind of outside jobs they can take, and already work long hours in often stressful jobs.†OíConnor credited FBI leadership with being flexible about the $3,000 cap on outside employment <U+2015> the FBIís shutdown Q&A page says ìflexibility is warrantedî with regard to the limit, given the unusual situation. But OíConnor said FBI special agents shouldnít have to be contemplating part-time work to being with.†ìFBI agents should not have to go work at a store stocking shelves because they canít feed their families on their government job,î OíConnor said. ìWhen are they going to find time to go get that second job?î†OíConnor also worried about the long-term impact on the bureauís ability to attract talent, given that new recruits at the FBI Academy at Quantico still havenít received their first paycheck from the government.ìThese people leave other jobs, many times taking a pay cut to join government service, they leave their families at home and they come to Quantico and they spend months at training. How long can you leave your family at home with your spouse and children, taking care of your family while youíre away doing your job and becoming an FBI agent, and you have no money to pay for mortgage, food, medical, anything that you need?î OíConnor asked. ìBrand new agents, at an entry level, are getting nothing and have gotten nothing.îAn FBI employee in the central region said in the report that an incoming FBI agent may move in with him and his wife to save money.†ìWe have a robust food bank going and hosted 200 federal employees for a free potluck lunch this week,î the FBI employee said. ìWe have a free breakfast planned for next week.î Another employee said that the ìdistraction of worrying about making ends meet is in the back of their minds.îìIíve always prided myself on being able to pay my bills on-time and in-full. The fact that I can no longer do that is humiliating and degrading,î said one FBI agent from the southeast region. ìLike many of my fellow agents, I took a sizable pay cut to come to serve my country as an FBI special agent. I accepted this position because I wanted to serve the cause of justice instead of clients.

But most government-contracted workers usually arenít as lucky.Itís unclear how many contracted workers <U+2015> employed in a range of occupations,†including food services, janitorial, security and computer software development <U+2015> were impacted by the recent shutdown.†Estimates range from hundreds of thousands to millions.President Donald Trump and other high-ranking officials downplayed the shutdownís effects on Americans, pointing out that federal employees would eventually receive back pay.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday said he didnít ìquite understandî why some workers needed to rely on food pantries during the shutdown†<U+2015> the longest such closure in U.S. history <U+2015> when they could just take out loans until the government reopens and they receive their back pay.The Trump administrationís tone-deaf statements also failed to acknowledge government-contracted workers who may never see the money they missed during the shutdown.†The president signed a bill on Jan. 16 that guarantees back pay for federal employees at ìthe earliest date possibleî once the government reopens, but the legislation did not extend protections to contractors <U+2015> many of whom are low-income earners.After vowing to veto a spending bill that would reopen federal agencies hit by the shutdown if it did not include $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, Trump caved to Democrats on Friday and signed a measure to keep the government open for three weeks.He has vowed to continue his push for wall funding during this period and, if again stymied, unilaterally move forward with erecting the barrier by declaring itís needed for national security reasons.ìIf we donít get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency,î he said Friday.Mulvaney on Sunday said he believes Trump is prepared to shut down the government again if his demands arenít met.ìHeís willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border,î Mulvaney said. ìHe doesnít want to shut the government down <U+2015> letís make that very clear.

The bill, which also calls for†major changes the would restrict asylum laws for Central American minors, is likely to get little or no Democratic support.†Under the McConnell-Schumer deal, the Senate will also vote Thursday on a House-passed bill that would provide funding to re-open all parts of the government until Feb. 8 while congressional leaders and Trump focus on trying to reach an accord on border security issues. This measure is unlikely to get enough Republican support because it does not include funding for Trumpís border wall, which as a candidate he promised Mexico would pay for.Only 10 GOP senators signed a bipartisan letter earlier this month calling on Trump to reopen the government with a similar short-term measure while negotiations over the border issues proceed. Thatís short of the 13 Republicans needed to advance the measure, assuming all 47 members of the Senate Democratic caucus support it. The GOPís Senate leadership actively lobbied members against signing the letter.The purpose of Thursdayís showdown may be more political than practical <U+2015> Anxious senators up for re-election in 2020 on both sides of the aisle would be able to tell constituents and federal workers they voted to re-open the government.†McConnell in a Tuesday floor speech urged Democrats to ìput country over partyî and ìtake yes for an answerî by accepting Trumpís offer, which the president announced over the weekend in a speech at the White House. McConnell called it the ìonly proposal currently before us that can be signed by the president and immediately re-open the government.îSchumer, meanwhile, slammed Trumpís proposal as ìone-sidedî and ìharshly partisan,î adding in his floor speech that no Democrats were involved in discussions over it. He called the proposed changes to asylum law in the bill a ìpoison pill,î and said the measure is ìgoing nowhere fast.îThe competing rhetoric that had little chance of resolving the shutdown that began on Dec. 22 occurred as some furloughed federal workers lined up at a food bank in downtown Washington, just blocks from the White House. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) compared that scene to†something out of the Great Depression.The furloughed federal workers just keep coming and coming to the World Central Kitchen.

Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in an apparent reference to the Transportation Security Administrationís 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay.†A tipster who asked to remain anonymous shared the video with HuffPost, which hasnít been able to identify the person who approached Davis.†Davis remained silent, prompting the person to say, ìTaking that as a yes.îìTaxpayers paid for this flight? Fair enough,î he added.Members of Congress can have the government pay for regular flights to and from their home jurisdictions, as maintaining constituency contact is part of their job. Unlike the paychecks of TSA workers, as well as those of hundreds of thousands of other federal government workers affected by the shutdown, those paid flights do not go away during a government shutdown.Davis did not use his taxpayer-provided budget to purchase a first-class ticket and has never done so, his spokeswoman Ashley Phelps told HuffPost in an email.His office bought a regular coach ticket, but he was upgraded automatically because of his frequent flyer status, she added. ìThere was no additional cost to taxpayers.îAccepting the upgrade is not a violation of anti-corruption rules because itís something available to any person who accrues a certain number of miles and wasnít offered exclusively to Davis because of his position as an elected representative, an ethics officer in the House, who asked to speak on background since the episode is not under any official investigation, told HuffPost.All the same,†for someone with power over peopleís paychecks to enjoy a luxe experience amid mass economic disruption makes for a jarring sight.A photograph of Davis in the first class section of the plane made it into Politicoís Playbook PM newsletter†on Tuesday.Most of the GOP has stood with President Donald Trump during the shutdown, arguing that heís right to reject deals to reopen the government until he gets the funding he wants for his promised wall on the border with Mexico.Davis has frequently supported the party on the issue, according to the Chicago Sun-Times, and praised Trumpís approach.†But the congressman recently sided with Democrats on bills to reopen some agencies <U+2015> a nod, perhaps, to his political vulnerability, given his tight re-election in the 2018 midterms.This story has been updated with comment from an ethics officer in the House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But they were the first tangible signs of movement in a dispute that has caused a partial government shutdown, which Saturday entered its record 29th day.Trumpís refusal to sign spending bills that lack the $5.7 billion he wants to start constructing that wall, which Democrats oppose, has prompted the shutdown.The White House declined to provide details late Friday about what the president would be announcing. But Trump was not expected to sign the national emergency declaration heís been threatening as an option to circumvent Congress, according to two people familiar with the planning.Instead, Trump was expected to propose the outlines of a new deal that the administration believes could potentially pave the way to an end to the shutdown, according to one of the people. They were not authorized to discuss the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.The move, amid a shutdown that has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without paychecks, represents the first major overture by the president since Jan. 8, when he delivered an Oval Office address making the public case for his border wall. Democrats have said they will not negotiate until the government reopens, raising questions about how Trump might move the ball forward.Democrats were proposing $563 million to hire 75 more immigration judges, who currently face large backlogs processing cases, and $524 million to improve ports of entry in Calexico, California, and San Luis, Arizona, the Democratic House aide said. The money is to be added to spending bills, largely negotiated between the House and Senate, that the House plans to vote on next week.In addition, Democrats were working toward adding money for more border security personnel and for sensors and other technology to a separate bill financing the Department of Homeland Security, but no money for a wall or other physical barriers, the aide said.It was possible Democrats would unveil that measure next week as the cornerstone of their border security alternative to Trumpís wall, the aide said.Earlier Friday, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., who chairs the House Appropriations Committeeís homeland security subcommittee, said in an interview that some Democrats were asking leaders, ìWhat is our plan?ìThe aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnít authorized to discuss the details publicly. The Democratsí spending plans were first reported by The New York Times.In a video posted on his Twitter feed late Friday, Trump said both sides should ìtake the politics out of itî and ìget to workî to ìmake a deal.î But he also repeated his warnings, saying: ìWe have to secure our southern border. If we donít do that, weíre a very, very sad and foolish lot.ìWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said only that Trump was ìgoing to continue fighting for border securityî and ìgoing to continue looking for the solutionî to end what the administration had repeatedly referred to as a ìhumanitarian and national security crisis at the border.ìWhile few would argue that a humanitarian crisis is unfolding at the U.S.-Mexico border, as the demand for entry by migrants and the Trump administrationís hardline response overwhelm border resources, critics say Trump has dramatically exaggerated the security risks and argue that a wall would do little to solve existing problems.Trump will be speaking from the Diplomatic Room at 3 p.m.Trumpís Friday evening tweeted announcement came after Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Friday canceled her plans to travel by commercial plane to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan, saying Trump had caused a security risk by talking about the trip.The White House said there was no such leak.It was the latest turn ó and potentially the most dangerous ó in the high-stakes brinkmanship between Trump and Pelosi that has been playing out against the stalled negotiations over how to end the partial government shutdown.And it showed once again the willingness of the former hard-charging businessman to hit hard when challenged.It was an unusually combative week between the executive and legislative branches.Tensions flared when Pelosi suggested Trump postpone the annual State of the Union address, a grand Washington tradition ó and a platform for his border wall fight with Democrats ó that was tentatively scheduled for Jan. 29.Trump never responded directly. Instead, he abruptly canceled Pelosiís military flight on Thursday, hours before she and a congressional delegation were to depart for Afghanistan on the previously undisclosed visit to U.S. troops.Trump belittled the trip as a ìpublic relations eventî ó even though he had just made a similar stop in a conflict zone during the shutdown ó and said it would be best if Pelosi remained in Washington to negotiate to reopen the government.Pelosi, undeterred, quietly began making her own preparations for the overseas trip.But on Friday, Pelosi said her plan to travel by commercial plane had been ìleakedî by the White House.ìThe administration leaked that we were traveling commercially,î Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol. She said it was ìvery irresponsible on the part of the president.ìShe said the State Department told her ìthe president outingî the original trip made the scene on the ground in Afghanistan ìmore dangerous because itís a signal to the bad actors that weíre coming.ìThe White House said it had leaked nothing that would cause a security risk.Denying military aircraft to a senior lawmaker ó let alone the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency after the vice president, traveling to a combat region ó is very rare.Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California slammed Trump for revealing the closely held travel plan, calling it ìcompletely and utterly irresponsible in every way.ìSome Republicans expressed frustration. Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted, ìOne sophomoric response does not deserve another.î He called Pelosiís State of the Union move ìvery irresponsible and blatantly politicalî but said Trumpís reaction was ìalso inappropriate.ì___Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Kevin Freking, Jon Lemire, Matthew Daly, Andy Taylor, Mary Clare Jalonick, Matt Lee, Lolita C.

I look forward to giving a ìgreatî State of the Union Address in the near future!Trump quickly moved to shift blame for the delayed event to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected and are set to miss their second paychecks of the year on Friday.The president later fired back at the suggestion, saying he would give his address as planned on Jan. 29. Pelosi issued her own rebuttal, saying she wouldnít take the steps to authorize the address until the government was reopened.ìI am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the Presidentís State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,î the speaker wrote to Trump.Trump appeared to capitulate to Pelosiís tactics on Wednesday, saying it was her ìprerogativeî to suggest a later date.This afternoon, I sent @realDonaldTrump a letter informing him that the House will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the Presidentís State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened. https://t.co/r1oad0xEAh pic.twitter.com/kGEbayx95uThe Senate is preparing to vote on two competing proposals to end the shutdown on Friday, one backed by Republicans and the other by Democrats. The GOP proposal would give Trump the $5.7 billion heís demanded for a wall along the southern border, while the other plan would reopen the government through Feb. 8 without a wall but allow for negotiations to continue while federal employees get back to work.Neither proposal is expected to get the 60 votes needed to advance, meaning the shutdown will likely drag on for at least another week.Trump has continued to heap criticism on Democrats, telling reporters this week that the party had ìbecome radicalized.î However, House Democrats said theyíd be willing to up the budget for border security, possibly to the $5.7 billion level requested by the president, if the government could be reopened and those funds be used for measures other than a barrier.This article has been updated to include a response from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who shares regular updates on Twitter, said that furloughed workers were being recalled to do their jobs unpaid.On Jan. 16, Gottlieb tweeted an update, saying a bill had been signed into law that would ìguarantee that federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay will be compensated for the period of funding lapse.îMost of the foods affected by the inspection delays are low-risk foods that arenít typically the cause of foodborne illnesses. Instead, FDA workers have been conducting regular inspections on ìhigh riskî foods, which make up about 31 percent of the agencyís workload. Hereís the list of foods that are still being inspected:Modified atmosphere packaged products; acidified and low acid canned foods; seafood; custard filled bakery products; dairy products including soft, semi-soft, soft ripened cheese and cheese products, unpasteurized juices; sprouts ready-to-eat; fresh fruits and vegetables and processed fruits and vegetables; spices; shell eggs; sandwiches; prepared salads; infant formula; and medical foods.The FDA defines a foodborne illness, of which there are 48 million cases a year in the U.S., as a reaction to consuming food contaminated with pathogens, chemicals or toxins. Essentially, foods deemed to be at highest risk of carrying foodborne illnesses are still being regularly inspected. This could change, however, so itís important to check Gottliebís Twitter account, which posts frequent updates.Regardless of the FDAís rate of food inspections, itís always a good idea to practice the agencyís food safety guidelines when cooking at home.

Six Republicans bucked the president and voted for the measure: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Susan Collins (Maine), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah).†Both measures fell short of the 60-vote threshold to advance.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), the only Democrat who supported both proposals, said he did so because they represented ìa start to finding a way to reopenî the government.Roughly a quarter of the government has been shut down since Dec. 22, after Trump refused to sign any appropriations bill that didnít include funding for the border wall. The consequences of the showdown have been mounting for 800,000 federal workers forced off the job, with many struggling to pay rent and other bills after missing paychecks.A top Trump adviser warned this week that the economy may show no growth in the first quarter if the shutdown lasts much longer.†Democrats say they oppose building the wall ó which Trump as a candidate promised Mexico would pay for ó because it would be an ineffective deterrent against unauthorized immigration. They also argue that giving in to the president now would simply legitimize the tactic of shutting down the government over policy disagreements in future budget fights.Republicans, meanwhile, say additional barriers on the border are common-sense and needed. They also point out that congressional Democrats have agreed many times to fund construction of barriers on the border <U+2015> under Republican and Democratic administrations.†Itís unclear what, if anything, Thursdayís votes accomplished.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in his office Thursday afternoon to discuss a way forward that involves reopening the government for three weeks while both sides continue talking over border security. The 30-minute discussion between two leaders followed weeks of competing rhetoric on the Senate floor, leading some observers to believe that a breakthrough on the shutdown was near.But the idea quickly ran into opposition from the White House, which insisted in a statement on Thursday that any short-term measure reopening the government include a ìlarge down paymentî on the wall.Senate Democrats, meanwhile, said they could not support the idea of giving Trump funds for his border wall unless he reopens the government first.ìWhat does he hold workersí wages hostage for next? How many times will he try to hold wages hostage?î Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) told reporters on Thursday.Meanwhile, Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) havenít spoken in weeks <U+2015> save for a sharp exchange of letters about†postponing the presidentís annual State of the Union address because of the shutdown.Pelosi on Thursday similarly shot down the latest White House proposal to fund the wall.ìThat is not a reasonable agreement between senators,î Pelosi said on the House floor.†A group of House Democrats are working on a package that would meet Trumpís request of $5.7 billion†but only for border security measures other than a wall, such as technology, more agents and measures intended to fortify ports of entry.

They also agree that security at the border must be bolstered. But the bipartisan group, which includes some of the most senior members in the House and Senate, reached few other groundbreaking conclusions during their first meeting in the basement of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. After an initial exchange of pleasantries, the panelists retreated to familiar talking points in their opening statements about why President Donald Trumpís proposed wall is <U+2015> or isnít <U+2015> needed on the border with Mexico.ìToday weíre just touching gloves,î said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), one of the few members of the group who represent a southwestern border district,†at the start of the meeting.Under the agreement reached by Democrats and Trump last week <U+2015> a temporary accord that ended the 35-day partial government shutdown without any money for the wall <U+2015> a bicameral committee is tasked with reaching a broader border security deal. He said he was giving Democrats an opportunity to debate a measure he says is needed to lower crime and the influx of drugs across the border.On Wednesday, before the committee members even met, he signaled he was prepared to shut down the government again, tweeting that if the lawmakers are ìnot discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!îDemocrats, meanwhile, reiterated that while they support enhancing security measures ó including improvements to ports of entry, additional aircraft, vessels and Border Patrol agents ó they oppose the construction of a wall on the border.ìSmart border security is not overly reliant on physical barriers, which the Trump administration has failed to demonstrate are cost effective compared to better technology and more personnel,î House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said in her opening statement on Wednesday.She declined to say on Wednesday whether Democrats will ultimately support money for new barriers on the border, as Trump has demanded, however.ìEverything is on the table,î Lowey told reporters after the meeting.The chances of reaching a deal on border security will likely depend on discussions among congressional staffers that will occur behind closed doors and away from the glare of cameras. Among lawmakers who met Wednesday were some of the most experienced appropriators in Congress <U+2015> people who are used to hammering out deals and who have been doing so together in a bipartisan fashion for years.ìTechnology is important, but I think some fences and some other things are important too,î Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), one of those people, told his colleagues at the meeting on Wednesday.Trump remains, as ever, the wild card in the negotiations, however. He has demonstrated time and time again the ability to blow up agreements reached by Congress <U+2015> most recently after criticism from conservative opinion leaders and radio talk show hosts. In December, for example, he refused to sign a continuing resolution funding the government after being blasted by immigration hawks like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh for not doing enough to build a wall he initially promised that Mexico would pay for.Even if Democrats agree on additional funding for some form of physical barrier on the border, like fencing, which they previously supported, itís unclear whether Trump will accept it, given his previous demands for a barrier made of concrete or steel.ìThe White House is in the [conference meeting]. Theyíll be careful observers of what we do,î Shelby reminded reporters on Wednesday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

In a new letter to tenants this week, the company said they can keep paying their original rent.†An official with Tri-State Management told HuffPost on Wednesday that the company had received new information from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the rural rental assistance program that subsidizes most of its tenantsí rent. The official declined to share the new information.†PREVIOUSLY:†WASHINGTON <U+2015>†Hundreds of low-income tenants at housing complexes in four states now face rent hikes thanks to the government shutdown.A property management company told the tenants in a letter this week that because of the shutdown, the federal government is no longer subsidizing their rent.†ìAs of February 1, 2019, all tenants will be responsible for full basic rent,î said the letter, an image of which was tweeted Friday by a low-income housing advocate.The company,†Tri-State Management, confirmed it sent the letter to tenants at 28 buildings in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi. Altogether, the apartments have 758 units, but itís not clear if all of the units received the letter.An official with Tri-State told HuffPost that eviction proceedings could begin if the shutdown continues past February.†ìI hope it doesnít come to that,î the official said. ìI hope the government shutdown is over.îIf the shutdown continues into February, rent hikes and eviction threats will probably spread†as more landlords get antsy. The letter follows a similar note that a different Arkansas landlord sent to 50 properties last week.†The buildings are subsidized by a U.S. Department of Agriculture rental assistance program that supports 282,000 households nationwide, most of them with elderly residents. The agency said last week that rental assistance is funded through January.The federal governmentís bigger housing programs, run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, are funded only through February. Those programs support more than 3 million households.†President Donald Trump forced the shutdown of several federal agencies, including HUD and the USDA, to put pressure on Democrats to support $5.7 billion in funding for a border wall that he previously said Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused to budge.†The shutdown will get worse with time as 800,000 federal workers continue to miss checks, landlords miss rent and some 38 million Americans miss out on food benefits come March.†Members of Congress have been aware that HUD had failed to renew some contracts with landlords before the shutdown, jeopardizing subsidies for tens of thousands of households. But the swift response of USDA landlords has seemingly caught lawmakers off guard.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who has encouraged Trump to stand firm for his border wall and downplayed tales of shutdown woe, said he did not believe landlords could hike rent or threaten to evict their renters because of the governmentís incompetence.†ìOn most [rental] agreements it doesnít give them the ability to do that,î Meadows said, echoing a common sentiment among the lawmakers HuffPost has interviewed.†But housing subsidy recipients do not have ironclad protection, according to a legal analysis the National Housing Law Project released Friday. While HUDís regulation for landlords with Section 8 vouchers does not allow rent hikes or evictions if the government stops paying its share, it does allow them to evict tenants for ìbusiness or economic reasons,î such as wanting to lease an apartment for higher rent.And there are no clear protections for tenants with USDA rental assistance. ìWhat owners may do in the event of a government shutdown is not set out in [USDA rental assistance] regulations,î according to the analysis.The NHLP said 17,000 households would lose their USDA rental subsidy in February, and all the rest would lose theirs in March.The USDAís program finances both the landlordís mortgage and covers part of the rent, with tenants usually required to pay 30 percent of their income. Landlords have told HuffPost they will struggle to pay for staff and maintenance without the governmentís portion of their rental income.†Neither the USDA nor HUD have responded to requests for comment about the possibility of the shutdown causing evictions.†Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said the USDA is ìclearly not prioritizingî its affordable-housing programs for the poor and elderly.†ìThe longer the shutdown continues, the more eviction threats weíll see for residents of this and other subsidized programs,î Yentel said.†HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Youíre not getting your $5.7 billion border wall <U+2015> not from Mexico, not from Congress and, Iím willing to wager, not from taxpayers either.îTrumpís inability to strike a deal with Democrats for the money, Cupp argued, stemmed from his focus on ìtoo much tweeting, too much rallying, not enough governing.î†ìItís a shame too, because when you had the opportunity, the public support, Republicans in control of Congress, Democrats against the proverbial wall, you couldnít get it done,î she added.ìSo now itís time to accept the loss and move on to whatís next.îCupp then mocked the presidentís tweet earlier in the day when he again said he was almost alone in the White House, an assertion he also made on Christmas Eve, just days after the shutdown began.I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is ìchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.î The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, thereís almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...Some potentially productive uses for Trumpís ìme time,î Cupp joked, could be meditation, yoga or maybe even a better way to organize his goals.ìHow about a vision board where you paste pictures of all the things youíd like to accomplish this year?

Now, theyíre being told to get back on the job without pay.Thousands of staffers from agencies including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Aviation Administration will be forced to start punching the clock again, according to announcements made Tuesday.Per its newly published shutdown plan, the IRS will recall about 46,000 workers as tax filing season looms less than two weeks away. The added employees mean nearly 60 percent of the workforce will be on duty, which will help tax refunds to get out on time, but without compensation for the workers bearing the burden.Meanwhile a revised Department of Transportation shutdown plan indicates more than 3,600 FAA employees are back on the job. That number was calculated using†the DOTís initial plan released last month.In a statement released last week, the FAA called safety its ìtop priority,î adding that it is ìallocating resources based on risk assessment to meet all safety critical functions.îìIf we identify an issue, we recall inspectors and engineers to address it.îThe shutdown is the longest in U.S. history, dragging into its third week with no end in sight as Democrats face off with the GOP over President Donald Trumpís demands for more than $5 billion to build a border wall.On Tuesday, Trump invited moderate Democrats to a White House meeting only to be turned down once they began suspecting it was the presidentís attempt at a divide-and-conquer strategy to work a deal to pay for the wall.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the IRS plans to recall 36,000 workers; it plans to bring back about 46,000.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Since TSA services are considered essential, more than 50,000 TSA agents are among those forced to remain on the job.However, a significant number have been calling out sick. According to a CBS News report, on Saturday, sick calls were up by 70 percent from the same day in 2018.Last week the TSA union sounded the alarm on staff reductions, noting that some employees are starting to quit and warning it could present ìa massive security riskî for travelers.Despite the sick calls and departures, screening times have remained somewhat consistent across the country, CBS reported."

Democrats also wonít budge from the $1.3 billion set aside for border security currently in the budget. Negotiations remain at a standstill, resulting in the 24-day-long shutdown.Since Dec. 22, when the shutdown began, an estimated 420,000 federal workers are being forced to work without pay, according to the Senate Committee on Appropriations.Schultz on Tuesday encouraged Coast Guard members to continue working with pride despite the stalled paychecks.ìYou have proven time and again the ability to rise above adversity,î he said. ìStay the course, stand the watch, and serve with pride. You are not, and will not, be forgotten.îNumerous organizations have stepped up to the plate to provide support to federal workers who in financial straits due to the shutdown.

President Donald Trump eventually caved on his demand for more than $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and announced a deal for the government to reopen for three weeks.During the shutdown, planes have not undergone routine safety inspections, and workers across the industry were warning of what could happen when unpaid and overly stressed workers were still told to come in.ìEven though air traffic controllers and traffic management coordinators remain on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight, they donít know when theyíll receive their next paycheck and that adds more stress to an already stressful profession,î the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement†this month. ìThis shutdown and the resulting furloughs are rapidly eliminating the layers of redundancy and safety on which the NATCA is built.î†That stress came to a tipping point Friday when air traffic controllers appeared to call out sick en masse, on the heels of the†Transportation Security Administrationís announcement†that it was seeing a spike in ìunscheduled absencesî among its workers.

Trump has called Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) a ìclown.î Just last week, Trump claimed in interviews that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposed border security and was OK with higher crime rates.Trumpís calls for bipartisanship also did not prevent him from hitting a pair of his favorite themes.ìIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,î he said, referring to ongoing and coming probes into his relationship with Russia and his business dealings. ìIt just doesnít work that way.îTrump then referenced the elephant in the room: the recently ended and possibly returning government shutdown over his demand for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.ìAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States,î he said, setting up for his argument that U.S. taxpayers should spend many billions of dollars for his wall. ìIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall <U+2015> but the proper wall never got built.†I will get it built.îTrump, as is his custom, spent much of his speech boasting of accomplishments, including taking credit for things regardless of his actual role in them.He said the strength of the economy and low unemployment was a result of his presidency: ìWe have launched an unprecedented economic boom <U+2015> a boom that has rarely been seen before. Thereís been nothing like it.îIn fact, the economic trend lines have been relatively constant since the end of the financial crisis in 2009. Trump similarly claimed credit for the defeat of the self-declared Islamic State terror group, even though the strategy the military has used was developed under his predecessor, Barack Obama. He further took credit for a boom in U.S. energy production, even though that trend began under President George W. Bush and continued under Obama.In other instances, he made claims that were flat-out false or appeared to be apocryphal, adding to a running total of 4,235 such falsehoods since he took office.In the lengthy section of the speech devoted to illegal immigration, for example, Trump repeated a claim that kidnapped women and children are being smuggled into the country by ìthe thousandsî to be sold ìinto prostitution and modern-day slavery.îNeither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security has responded to numerous requests to provide details to support Trumpís claims on the matter.As most presidents before him, Trump promised a number of new proposals: an initiative to eliminate the spread of AIDS, an effort to reduce drug costs and another to fight childhood cancers.Which, if any, of Trumpís proposals advance at all beyond Tuesday nightís speech is an open question. Trumpís White House has been notoriously poor at following through on his professed initiatives.Trump promised a $1 trillion ìinfrastructureî plan to rebuild the nationís roads and bridges in his 2017 joint address to Congress five weeks after taking office and $1.5 trillion in last yearís State of the Union. No such plan ever materialized, and not a single dollar has been appropriated. (Trump again called for an infrastructure plan Tuesday night, but this time did not propose a dollar value.)As far as reaching out to Democrats and other political critics, Trump has done that before in prepared remarks as well, only to undo it all within days or even hours with his unscripted remarks and tweets.In 2017, after declaring that the ìtime for trivial fights is behind us,î Trump within a few days had attacked Obama, the Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress, the FBI investigation into his ties to Russia and, inexplicably, the host who replaced him on ìThe Apprenticeî television show.Last year, after calling on ìall of us to set aside our differences,î Trump a day and a half later attacked Democrats for having failed to support the tax cut legislation from months earlier and told audiences to replace them with more Republicans in the coming midterm elections.Apart from Trumpís inability or unwillingness to stick to a message, Tuesdayís speech will also soon be overshadowed by an actual deadline with real consequences.A temporary spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 expires a week from Friday, making another shutdown of a quarter of the government an imminent possibility. Last time, Senate Republicans <U+2015> who had already unanimously agreed to a short-term spending bill before Trump reneged on a commitment to sign it <U+2015> stood with Trump. After the resulting 35-day shutdown damaged their polling numbers, though, they may be less likely to go along with a second shutdown.And looming over the entire situation is Trumpís threat to declare a ìnational emergencyî if Congress doesnít give him the billions he is demanding for a border wall <U+2015> a declaration he believes will permit him to divert money from other programs.

Familiar topics, including his efforts to secure funding for a border wall, were centerpieces of the 82-minute speech, but new initiatives, such as plans to meet again with the North Korean leader and to tackle the spread of HIV, were also highlighted.Here are some of the major takeaways from the address.Trump hasnít backed down from his demand for a wall along Americaís southern border, but his definition of it has continued to evolve this year amid the fallout from a 35-day partial government shutdown,†a closure that led to a one-week delay of the State of the Union address.ìThis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier <U+2015> not just a simple concrete wall,î the president declared Tuesday. ìIt will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.îHe added that ìwalls workî and ìsave lives,î and urged lawmakers to forge a compromise that will ìtruly make America safe.î Democrats have long called for beefed-up border security, including new technology and more border agents, but have said a simple barrier would be costly and ineffective.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has continued to insist that†there will be no ìwall moneyî as part of a funding deal for the federal government, although she said sheís open to earmarking money for other border security efforts.The president spent weeks before last yearís midterm elections sounding an alarm over a large caravan of Central American migrants, painting the migrants as criminals in an attempt to build fears and garner support for his proposed wall. Many of those people were fleeing violence, hoping to apply for asylum at the U.S. border.Trump on Tuesday once again moved to paint a new caravan of about 1,600 people as a danger to American society, saying that, ìas we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.îìWe have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,î he said, pointing to his order to send an additional 3,750 troops to the border this week.ìThis is a moral issue,î he continued. ìThe lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans.îThe president has long touted his efforts to rein in North Koreaís nuclear weapon program, and Trump said he would meet with the countryís leader, Kim Jong Un, for a second time later this month in Vietnam.ìAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula,î Trump said. ìOur hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed.îThe meeting is scheduled to take place on Feb. 27 and 28, although critics have expressed skepticism about what progress can be made. Pyongyang has yet to give up any of the weaponry Trump has said it would, and American intelligence chiefs said last month that North Korea was ìunlikely to give up all of its [nuclear] stockpiles.îTrump has seized control of the anti-abortion talking point ahead of the 2020 election and urged Congress to ìdefend the dignity of every personî during his State of the Union speech.ìI am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the motherís womb,î the president said. ìLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children <U+2015> born and unborn <U+2015> are made in the holy image of God.îThe focus on such abortions comes after New York passed a new law last month that permits the termination of pregnancies after the 24th week only in the ìabsence of fetal viabilityî or if the ìabortion is necessary to protectî a motherís life or health. Such abortions are rare, amounting to 1.3 percent of total procedures in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Abortion rights advocates have lambasted Trumpís imagery and characterizations of the law as absurd.The president said he planned to implement a 10-year strategy to reduce and possibly end the spread of HIV infections in the United States, even though his administration has been criticized for its work on the issue so far.ìIn recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS,î Trump said. ìScientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.îThough the move would amount to a major American policy initiative, the Trump administration has been criticized for leaving major HIV leadership positions unfilled for months. Vice President Mike Pence has also been criticized for his policies while he was governor of Indiana, where he oversaw cuts to public health funding that contributed to the worst HIV outbreak in the stateís history.Trump has long touted Americaís renewed interest in fossil fuel production as a boon to the economy, despite increasingly dire reports from the worldís leading scientists about the scourge of climate change.ìWe have unleashed a revolution in American energy <U+2015> the United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world,î the president said. ìAnd now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.îAlthough his address didnít include familiar talking points about ìbeautifulî clean coal, the presidentís policies helped global carbon emissions hit record highs in 2018.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Such a bill, Democrats say, could pass with enough support in the Senate <U+2015> 67 votes <U+2015> to override a presidential veto.†ìThe issue here is the Senate really does need to do its job as a separate and co-equal branch of government,î Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said Tuesday on the Senate floor, urging McConnell to allow the Senate to make use of its powers under the Constitution to try to end the partial government shutdown.McConnell, however, has said that it would be pointless to vote on any spending bill that does not have the support of the president. He shot down the veto override suggestion on Tuesday,†telling reporters at a weekly press conference that Trump is correct to push for additional border security funding.ìIn a situation like this where the president in my view is in the right place trying to get the right outcomeÖ of course not,î McConnell said when asked by an NBC News reporter if he would try to reopen the government with a veto override.But if McConnell believed the situation on the border was so critical that it needed additional security measures like Trumpís wall, he could have pushed for that funding in December, when the Senate passed a short-term government funding bill easily by voice vote. The Kentucky Republican did not.McConnell instead called on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to sit down again with Trump and come to an agreement on wall funding, essentially attempting to take himself out of negotiations amid the ongoing shutdown.ìLet me repeat again what Iíve said now for three weeks: The solution is a negotiation between the one person who can sign something into law, the president of the United States, and our Democratic colleagues,î McConnell said Tuesday.The last time Trump huddled with congressional leaders at the White House, the president walked out of the meeting after Pelosi said she did not support his proposed border wall.ìHe just got up and said we have nothing to discuss, and he walked out,î Schumer said last week. ìHe just walked out of the meeting.îDemocrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions as the shutdown continues this week, with no significant talks occurring to reopen the government.

Nearly one-third of the civilian federal workforce has served in the military, although the percentage varies greatly from agency to agency.Some 800,000 federal workers have gone without pay since Dec. 22. According to Stars and Stripes, an estimated 155,000 veterans work in agencies affected by the shutdown, 50,000 of them with a disability rating.The comments that prompted Wilkieís letters came from Edward Canales, a local AFGE president and a union liaison officer for veterans. Canales is an Army veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm and is ìa 100 percent disabled veteranî due to combat injuries, according to his union bio. He told ABC News†last week that he had fielded calls from veterans who work for the government and were distraught over how to pay their bills during the shutdown.ìIf this shutdown does not stop, we are going to have fatalities,î Canales said, according to ABC. ìWeíre going to have suicides.îWilkie apparently felt that remark was out of bounds. In a letter the VA made public on Monday, the secretary said that the union was promoting the stereotype of ìveteran as victim.î He didnít buy the idea that stress brought on by the shutdown could lead to a veteranís suicide.ì[T]he notion that most Veterans are so fragile from their service that the slightest hint of hardship can push them to the brink of mental breakdown or even self-harm is preposterous, which is why Veterans and Veteran advocates are continuously fighting this shopworn canard,î Wilkie wrote.Wilkie called on AFGEís national president, J. David Cox, to apologize. Cox declined and instead fired back at Wilkie, saying the Trump administration ìhas been one of the worst on record for our countryís heroes.î He also said that White House officials donít grasp the financial stress the shutdown is causing.ìThe President and his cabinet have left [veterans] out in the cold, forcing them to work without pay and subjecting veterans and their families to the uncertainty of not knowing when or where their next paycheck will come from,î Cox said in a statement on Monday. ìFinancial pressures experienced by working people are apparently not something this administration either understands or cares about.îThe current shutdown became the longest in U.S. history on Saturday. The president, who said he would be ìproudî to close the government over border security, has demanded that Congress provide $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border that he used to claim Mexico would pay for. Democratic lawmakers have refused.Roughly a quarter of government functions have gone unfunded, leading agencies to furlough 380,000 workers and require another 420,000 ìessentialî employees to work without pay. Democratic leaders in the House have moved several bills that would reopen agencies while Congress and the president negotiated over the wall, but Trump and Republican leaders in the Senate have declined to take up the measures.The House and Senate passed a bill last week approving backpay for government workers affected by the shutdown, as has been done in past shutdowns. But the workers wonít get paid until the government reopens and payrolls are processed.

Paul Ryan, who was then the speaker of the House, told Trump he saw no way for Republicans to win a standoff. And Kevin McCarthy, then the House majority leader, warned that a shutdown during the holiday season was a bad idea.†Trump, nevertheless, pushed ahead, refusing to sign legislation to keep the government operating <U+2015> unless he received money for his border wall, which during the campaign he said Mexico would pay for.†Republican leaders had good reason to be cautious about shutting down the government: The GOP would probably get blamed for it. Historically, the public tends to hold the Republican Party for such impasses.†ìRepublicans usually get the blame for shutdowns because they usually cause the shutdowns, which is inevitable as they have become more controlled by their ideologically extreme members,î said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner.†Trump is learning this lesson now. The current shutdown is the longest in history, with no end in sight. He continues to insist on money for his border wall, while Democrats refuse to give it to him.†The public is blaming Trump for the mess, according to polls by HuffPost/YouGov and other news outlets. To be clear, no one in government comes out looking especially good during a shutdown, but he is being held responsible (as he once said he wanted to be).†Although three Senate Republicans have called for the government to reopen, most are sticking by Trump <U+2015> even despite the loss of public support.ìHe actually is moving the numbers in his direction compared to a year ago, in terms of the wall,î Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) argued Tuesday.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) added that†ìthe president has moved further in trying to find a balance there than the other side has.îVoters blamed congressional Republicans for a shutdown†in 2013†(when the GOP wanted to extract concessions on killing Obamacare) and two from†1995 to 1996†(when President Bill Clinton refused to go along with GOP budget cuts).†Newt Gingrich certainly didnít help his party gain support for the shutdowns in the 1990s. Gingrich, who was House speaker, was already unpopular. Then he indicated that he had shut down the government for a very personal reason: He felt Clinton snubbed him on a flight from Israel in November.†ìThis is petty,î Gingrich told reporters, according to a Nov. 17, 1995, article in The Washington Post. ì[But] you land at Andrews [Air Force Base] and youíve been on the plane for 25 hours and nobody has talked to you and they ask you to get off the plane by the back ramp.†Ö You just wonder, where is their sense of manners? Where is their sense of courtesy?îClinton also effectively†used his bully pulpit to shame Republicans, highlighting the personal toll of the shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. During his 1996 State of the Union address, he honored the service of Richard Dean, a heroic public servant who risked his life to save others during the Oklahoma City bombing the previous April. He was sat in the first ladyís box for the address, and when Clinton honored Deanís service, the entire chamber applauded him. From Clintonís speech:Iíd like to give you one example. His name is Richard Dean. He is a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran whoís worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now. Last year he was hard at work in the federal building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him. He re-entered that building four times. He saved the lives of three women. Heís here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism.Then Clinton delivered his kicker: Dean had been furloughed during the shutdowns. Clintonís call for Congress to never again shut down the government received boisterous cheers from Democrats. Gingrich, meanwhile, sat awkwardly at the dais behind Clinton.†But Richard Deanís story doesnít end there. This last November, he was forced out of his office when the government shut down. And the second time the government shut down, he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay.On behalf of Richard Dean and his family and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this chamber: Never, ever shut the federal government down again.The ensuing coverage declared Clintonís speech a success and panned the GOP response from Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (Kan.). The San Jose Mercury News praised Clintonís ìconciliatory-sounding speechî and criticized Doleís ìsharply partisan response.îìPresident Clinton ate the Republicansí supper Tuesday night, but House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Bob Dole wound up with heartburn,î wrote Chicago Sun-Times syndicated columnist Carl Rowan two days later.And there was no doubt that House Republican Whip Tom DeLay (Texas) realized that politically, Clinton had won. According to the 1997 book Mirage by George Hager and Eric Pianin, DeLay went home and rewatched the State of the Union speech at 1:30 a.m.ìTom DeLay screamed at Bill Clinton, fighting the urge to throw something,î Hager and Pianin write, adding that DeLay sat ìraging at his television set, calling Clinton a ëlying, disingenuous, smarmy son of a bitch.íîThe Trump administration, so far, has not gone the Clinton route of talking about individual federal workers and the toll the shutdown is taking on them. Democrats in Congress, however, have been doing so, in an effort to shame the president and congressional Republicans into giving up their border wall demand.†Instead, Trump and his aides have downplayed being furloughed and missing paychecks <U+2015> comparing it to a vacation <U+2015> and claimed that most federal workers are standing behind him. (There is no evidence of that.)A 2018 shutdown, which lasted just three days, had blame spread more evenly. According to a HuffPost/YouGov poll, 61 percent of Americans surveyed said they blamed Congress as a whole, with equal blame going to Democrats and Republicans (and less to Trump). That shutdown was precipitated by Senate Democrats trying to incorporate into budget negotiations a deal to help the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.Shutdowns often donít have long-term electoral consequences, though. In the 1996 and 2014 congressional elections, Republicans made gains, despite shouldering most of the blame for recent shutdowns. But in 1996, Clinton won re-election, defeating Dole. And in 2018, Democrats took control of the House.†So Trump may not bear the political costs of the shutdown in 2020. But then again, no shutdown has ever lasted this long, and itís not clear how steep the costs will be both on individuals and to the broader economy.Igor Bobic contributed reporting.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

And while the Trump administrationís energy creed is no secret, the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> the longest in the history of the United States <U+2015> is proof that for President Donald Trump and his team, few things take precedence over fossil fuels.As an estimated 800,000 federal workers went without paychecks, leaving many financially insecure as national parks around the country fell into disarray. Despite this,†the Trump administration has still found a way to plow ahead with its ìenergy dominanceî agenda. With a skeleton staff, the Interior Department continues working to expand oil and gas development in the Alaskan Arctic. The agencyís Bureau of Land Management is processing fossil fuel drilling applications and permits. And last week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management amended its shutdown contingency plan†to bring back dozens of furloughed employees, some on an on-call basis, to continue work on offshore drilling activities. Those efforts,†backed by carryover funds from 2018, included preparing for an upcoming lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, processing Atlantic seismic exploration permits and developing a new five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program.The failure to hold upcoming Gulf lease sales would ìhave a negative impact to the Treasury and negatively impact investment in the U.S. Offshore Gulf of Mexico,î BOEM wrote in its updated plan. And the agency must press ahead with its revised offshore leasing plan ìto comply with the Administrationís America First energy strategy,î it said.ìWe have not seen any major effects of the shutdown on our industry,î Mike Sommers, president of oil and gas trade group American Petroleum Institute,†told reporters†last week, according to Natural Gas Intelligence.†Democrats in Congress and advocacy groups are aghast at the administrationís priorities, especially while federal workers go without pay. In a joint statement Thursday, environmental groups Earthjustice, League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council accused the administration of stooping to a ìnew level of ëdirty.íîìInstead of working with Congress to end the longest government furlough in American history, the Trump Administration is prioritizing a radical, unpopular plan to subject Americaís coasts to more offshore drilling,î they said. In a Wednesday letter to David Bernhardt, the acting secretary of the Interior Department and a former fossil fuel lobbyist, House Natural Resources Chairman Rep. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.) and other Democrats accused the administration of caring ìonly about the [shutdownís] impacts on its favorite industry and not about workers, their families, and ordinary Americans.î They called on Bernhardt to reverse his ìoutrageousî decision to forge ahead with offshore drilling work or visit Capitol Hill to provide legal justification for the move.†Over the last two weeks of the shutdown, BLM has significantly ramped up oil and gas permitting, according to an†analysis†by Colorado-based advocacy group Center for Western Priorities.CWP is tracking @DOIDepSec's @BLMNational oil & gas permitting and leasing during government shutdown. As of today, BLM has approved/accepted:  -10 new drilling permits-6 new oil and gas leases -154 drilling permit applications -109 lease nominationshttps://t.co/M0RVRGQuFHMeanwhile, the Interiorís work related to offshore wind energy is at a standstill. BOEM has postponed several meetings to get pubic input on an 800-megawatt wind farm slated to begin construction this year off the coast of Massachusetts. And Bloomberg reported this week that wind energy reps fear that the shutdown <U+2015> now in its fourth week, with no end in site <U+2015> could complicate and impede offshore wind development in the Northeast.†The Interiorís preferential treatment of big oil since the shutdown began on Dec. 22 stands in contrast to the rhetoric from former agency chief Ryan Zinke, who claimed the administration doesnít play favorites when it comes to powering America. ìThe president and myself, we donít pick winners and losers,î Zinke said in May 2017 at the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston ìWe donít favor oil and gas over any other industry.îTrump and his team have repeatedly accused the Obama administration of being at ìwarî with fossil fuels. ìWe have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal,î Trump declared in his 2018 State of the Union address.Despite two years of regulatory rollbacks and receiving priority treatment during the shutdown, some in the industry still arenít satisfied. In a blog post last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerceís Global Energy Institute compiled a list of 20 regulatory reforms that could be impacted or delayed by the shutdown. ìWe are very concerned about the regulatory progress being stifled,î Christopher Guith, the instituteís senior vice president, told the Washington Examiner.The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPostís request for comment Thursday.

More than half of those employees are in the division that processes tax returns and handles taxpayer phone calls. And more than 14,000 of those workers either claimed a hardship exemption or could not be reached, according to a congressional aide.†The staffing shortage was first reported Friday by The Washington Post.†President Donald Trump has refused to approve government funding legislation unless congressional Democrats agree to include more than $5 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, even though he previously said Mexico would pay for the wall. More than 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or working without pay since Dec. 22.†The Trump administration initially said the IRS would collect taxes but not distribute refunds, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars annually but then said refunds would be paid after all.†For most households, tax season should be normal, according to the Tax Policy Center, but refunds may take longer than usual. Filers who have questions for the IRS about their returns, however, may run into trouble.†Tax professionals have told HuffPost that the shutdown has made it difficult to help their clients because they canít get anyone from the government on the phone to resolve problems.†Amber Morgan-Storms is an enrolled agent, a type of tax practitioner licensed by the Treasury Department, in Redlands, California.

Mondayís call-out rate stood at 7.6 percent, compared with 3.2 percent the year before, according to TSA spokesman Michael Bilello. Wednesdayís call-out rate was 6.1 percent.†There is no definitive proof that flying is less safe during a shutdown. The woman who traveled from Atlanta to Tokyo with a gun in her carry-on luggage earlier this month did so on a day when a normal number of TSA agents were working, the agency said. And earlier this week, the Federal Aviation Administration called about 3,600 employees back to work†to address safety concerns.But some industry insiders say exhaustion and anxiety over missed paychecks could be taking a real toll.†A coalition of 34 air travel industry groups sent a letter to President Donald Trump,†Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell†(R-Ky.) last week to urge them to end the shutdown, outlining specific concerns regarding staffing, mechanics and other issues.On Wednesday, a top member of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association told CNNís Poppy Harlow that air travel has become less safe than it was before the shutdown began. Trump has pledged to hold out ìas long as it takesî for a spending bill to pass Congress with more than $5 billion for his proposed border wall.†ìI would say†[flying] is less safe today than it was a month ago, absolutely,î said Trish Gilbert, executive vice president of the group, which is suing the Trump administration over the shutdown.†Gilbert explained: ìWe are working with barebones crews. We have controllers there doing what they do very, very well, but how long can you expect them to do it without all of the systems behind them to keep the system safe? And the planes in the air?îA NATCA colleague expressed similar worries in an interview with The Washington Post but said definitively that the system is safe. For how long, though, he could not say. One of Gilbertís concerns was that the people whose job it is to address reports from air traffic controllers over potential safety problems are not working.ìThis is a horrible game of chicken that weíre in the middle of, and we need to get out of it,î Gilbert said.†In a Jan. 10 letter addressed to Trump and congressional leaders, heads of the Association of Flight Attendants and Association of Professional Flight Attendants invoked the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in their plea for full government funding. Although paid by individual airlines, flight attendants would be among the first affected by any lapse in safety procedures.ìWe serve as the last line of defense in aviation security,î they wrote. ìOn September 11, 2001, we lost our friends and colleagues while our profession changed forever.îCalling airline security a ìlayered approach,î the flight attendantsí representatives said that government agencies are necessary to conduct cybersecurity work and security inspections, and to assess passengers and certify infrastructure.Capt. Joe DePete, head of the Air Line Pilots Association, has separately written to Trump asking for an immediate end to the stalemate, saying ìthe disruptions being caused by the shutdown are threatening the safe operations of this network.î†When contacted by HuffPost, though, DePete said in a statement that passengers should not worry.ìAt this point, despite the shutdown, flying remains safe because no ALPA member or airline pilot would ever take off if thereís any reason to be concerned about safety,î he said.†Yet, as the shutdown drags on, DePete warned, ìsome of the programs and processes that help us maintain aviation safety and monitor the systemís integrity are at risk of being weakened.î†HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

But it was too late to save her car. She fell behind on payments and the 2012 Chevy Malibu had already been repossessed <U+2015> taken away from her driveway by a tow truck just hours before President Donald Trump agreed to reopen federal agencies heíd held hostage in a futile effort to win support for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, when she first goes back to work, Onley will have to ask family members for help getting to the nearest subway station to her house in Olney, Maryland, which is about an hour outside of Washington. ìI donít have any money to get to work,î Onley, 27, said in an interview. ìIíve asked so many family members for help but they still have their life as well.î And unlike the 800,000 federal workers who will get five weeksí worth of back pay now that the shutdown is over, Onley will get nothing. She works for a security contractor, not the government itself. Congress routinely approves back pay for federal workers who missed wages during a shutdown, and the most recent funding lapse is no exception. But thousands of federal contract workers donít get paid back, leaving many contractor employees, such as food workers, janitors, security officers and computer software developers behind on their bills. Democrats introduced legislation that would direct federal agencies to adjust the terms of contracts with private companies that had been suspended or interrupted by the shutdown. Agencies would pay the contractors for the cost of their lowest-paid employeesí missing wages, so long as itís not more than what the employees regularly earned.†Firmsí participation in the backpay scheme would be voluntary.ìIt uses a mechanism that exists to reimburse contractors for expenses incurred under a shutdown ... it just applies it to labor costs, which has never been done before. Itís a nice simple way of dealing withî the problem, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), who introduced the bill earlier this month, said on Tuesday.Bills to repay federal employees are usually uncontroversial and bipartisan <U+2015> Congress has in the past voted to reimburse federal workers once shutdowns ended. The plan to repay contractors, however, has only Democratic supporters so far. Smith told HuffPost she hoped Republicans would support it ìbecause it seems clear that if you support back pay for federal employees, these are the same people working side-by-side with federal employees and they should get the same kind of treatment.îTrump signed legislation into law earlier this month guaranteeing back pay for federal employees who were forced off the job during the longest government shutdown in history, which sucked $3 billion out of the economy that will not be recovered, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That sum partly represents the unpaid wages of thousands of federal contractors. White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told CBSí ìFace the Nationî on Sunday that the issue of back pay for contractors will ìdepend on the contract.î Trumpís chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, meanwhile, said he wasnít familiar with the issue.ìI think the defense-related ones will Ö I honestly donít know,î Kudlow, who chairs the White House council of economic advisers, told reporters during a White House press briefing on Monday.Proponents of the effort to reimburse federal contractors for lost wages hope to include the Smith measure in a broader agreement on border security currently being negotiated by a bipartisan conference committee that was formed after Trump agreed to reopen the government last week. Those discussions on continued government funding face a deadline of Feb. 15, however, and itís not clear whether both sides will reach an accord in time, given Trumpís insistence on funding to begin constructing a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Democrats oppose.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said not all contract workers should get repaid and it would depend on their assignment. ìI think you really have to do that on an agency-by-agency basis,î Tillis told HuffPost. ìThereís probably some instances when you should.î One problem for the bill is that itís not totally†clear how many contract employees missed pay because of the shutdown or how many would benefit from the legislation. Democrats said Tuesday theyíre still trying to find out the total number of people who work for companies on federal contracts.†According to an estimate by Good Jobs Nation, a labor-backed group that often advocates for federal contract workers, more than 1 million such workers were stiffed by the shutdown.†The federal government uses contractors instead of employing people directly to cut costs, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said. †ìThe federal government uses contractors <U+2015> that was work previously done by federal workers <U+2015> because they wanted to save money,î Norton said. But ìwe have no right to save money by depriving employees who were kept from going to work.î The legislation would cap payments at $965 per worker per week, so it would make workers whole only if they earn less than†$50,000 annually. Workers who earn more could still be paid back for the portion of their wages that is less than $50,000 on an annualized basis, but the bill is designed especially for lower-paid janitors who clean federal buildings and security guards like Onley.Onley and several other non-government government workers came to the Capitol on Tuesday to stand with Smith and other sponsors of her legislation. The workers are members of a local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, which says it represents more than 600 janitors and security officers who were furloughed during the shutdown. Onley said she had already fallen behind on car payments before the shutdown. Sheíd been unemployed for several weeks before she got her security guard job with Allied Universal in November. She has a 3-year-old daughter and managed the past five weeks with the help of friends and family, who gave her $20 here, $30 there. Sheís glad Democrats are pushing for back pay but aware that it might not work out. ìThatís the sad thing, itís not a definite,î Onley said. ìWeíre here to fight for it. All we can do is pray.îCLARIFICATION:†An earlier version of this story said the legislation would only benefit workers who earn less than $50,000. The bill actually would repay any worker but at a weekly rate that on an annualized basis is less than $50,000. This story has also been updated to include the Good Jobs Nation estimate of how many contract workers were furloughed by the shutdown.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

She manages about 50 properties across Arkansas and said 80 percent of her tenants benefit from a rural housing assistance program that pays most of their rent.†She had been unable to reach her USDA contacts since the shutdown started in December and had assumed the program had lapsed.††PREVIOUSLY:†Some renters in Arkansas are already facing eviction, thanks to the partial government shutdown. †A property manager told tenants at properties in Alma†and†several other towns that the shutdown has cut off a federal rental assistance program that covers a portion of their rent. ìUntil the government opens again, you are responsible for ALL of your rental amount,î the letter said, threatening eviction if tenants donít pay up by the 20th. The shutdown is creating financial stress for hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers. If the shutdown continues, low-income renters could also feel the sting.Tens of thousands of low-income households relying on the federal government to help them pay rent could lose that assistance if the shutdown persists. Many of those households include seniors and people with disabilities.†Diane Yentel, the director of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called it ìappallingî that a landlord has already threatened to evict tenants because of the shutdown. But she said itís ultimately on Congress and President Donald Trump, who said he wonít sign a government funding bill that doesnít include $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.ìIt is incredibly reckless to risk the homes of some of our countryís poorest seniors, people with disabilities and families with children as perceived leverage for a fight that has nothing to do with them,î she said. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said it canít renew some contracts with private landlords in its project-based rental assistance program, known as Section 8, which contracts with private building owners to reserve at least 40 percent of their rental units for low-income families.†Project-based affordable housing supports 1.4 million households. An additional 2.2 million households use portable rental vouchers, which are funded until March.About 1,150 housing contracts under the program were up for renewal but expired in HUDís system after parts of the federal government closed Dec. 22. Those contracts include 500 expiring this month and affect roughly 40,000 households, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and two-thirds of those affected are elderly or are people with disabilities who, on average, have an annual income of less than $13,000.†HUD expects an additional 550 contracts to expire in February. The National Low Income Housing Coalition created an interactive map showing where the expiring contracts are in the U.S. The only states that donít have households with Section 8 contracts that have expired or may soon expire are Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and West Virginia.HUD has suggested that the rental contract expirations likely wonít lead landlords to start evicting residents anytime soon. The department has asked landlords not to evict tenants and to dip into reserve funds to meet expenses, if necessary. But the low-income renters in Alma are apparently subsidized by a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for rural areas, not HUD. The property manager did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ìThe longer the shutdown goes on, the more untenable it becomes for owners to keep scraping by without the federal funds theyíre expecting <U+2015> and the more likely it becomes that those owners will start resorting to rent hikes or evictions of these lowest-income renters, as we are now seeing,î Yentel said.A spokesperson for the USDA said the agencyís rental assistance contracts with multi-family properties are funded through the end of January, but that a small number of owners may have faced a delay for Decemberís payments. Itís not clear what the problem is with the contract in Alma or the other Arkansas properties managed by ASC Property Management, the firm that sent the eviction threats.†The shutdown is now in its 25th day ó the longest shutdown in U.S. history. If the government doesnít reopen before the end of February, Section 8ís tenant-based voucher program will no longer have any funding. That means housing authorities wonít make voucher payments to landlords nationwide when March rents are due, possibly leading to evictions.Additionally, the USDAís Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can guarantee food stamps only†through February, leading many low-income families to face the prospect of losing both housing and food assistance. Food banks nationwide are pitching in to help as many furloughed workers as possible, and theyíre bracing for an influx of visitors if SNAP benefits halt.The partial shutdown doesnít appear to be anywhere near a resolution. An estimated 800,000 federal employees will not be paid until funding resumes; about 420,000 of them have been deemed essential and must continue to work.This story has been updated to include a response from the USDA and Annette Cowenís revised position.†HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

A HUD spokesperson told NPR that the secretary was specifically referring to congressional leaders.Carson,†who has not spoken out since the shutdown began 35 days ago, runs one of the federal agencies directly affected by the closures.His comments followed remarks from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross shrugging off the shutdownís impact†on 800,000 unpaid federal workers, many of whom are struggling to pay their bills. Ross, whose own net worth is an estimated $700 million, suggested Thursday that workers†should take out loans to cover the costs of necessities instead of relying on food pantries.Two competing proposals aimed at†reopening the federal government failed Thursday in the Senate. President Donald Trump has vowed to veto any bill meant to end the shutdown if it does not include $5.7 billion for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Most of HUDís employees have been furloughed, and those who were called back on the job without pay are ìworking around the clockî to make sure people who had been receiving housing assistance donít face eviction, Carson said. HUD has already said itís unable to renew some contracts with landlords in a rental assistance program that supports 1.4 million households.Federal workers in the affected agencies are set to miss their second paycheck on Friday. Carson said those employees are only going to suffer more the longer the shutdown continues.ìWe really need to think about them, as opposed to some political victory,î Carson told NPR. ìAnd it does worry me about the future of our country. If weíre going to do everything based on ideology and hatred, I just donít see how we are going to be successful as a country.îThe HUD secretary joins some former Trump administration officials in the growing call to end the shutdown. John Kelly and four other former secretaries of homeland security†told Trump and congressional leaders on Wednesday that they needed to restore funding to that department. Former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn called for the shutdownís end†from the economic summit in Davos, Switzerland.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

The awards, distributed annually to support junior faculty members in science and engineering, will provide her with a $500,000, 5-year grant to research and write a book about veterans in the criminal justice system.For the last two years, Rowen has been studying Veteran Treatment Courts, which provide addiction and mental health treatment to military veterans as an alternative to incarceration <U+2015> all issues that the Trump administration has prioritized. Rowen expected to receive final approval from NSF this month and funding in early February. But the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> the longest in Americaís history <U+2015> has prevented awards from being processed.ìWhen you write out these grants, you write out timelines,î Rowen told HuffPost. ìMy timeline is now blown up.îSheís far from alone. The NSF hasnít divvied out a single dollar in grant money since the shutdown began Dec. 22. During the same time period a year ago, the federal agency awarded more than 400 research grants valued at†$127.3 million, according to a running tally by Benjamin Corb, public affairs director of The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.ìThe impact on science is a slow strangling of the American scientific enterprise,î Corb wrote in an email.President Donald Trumpís demand that Congress fork over $5.7 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has left some 800,000 federal workers without pay. The Senate is set to vote Thursday on a pair of measures aimed at reopening the government, but neither is expected to pass, as HuffPost reported.With seemingly no end to the political battle in sight, thereís no telling when Rowen will receive the grant money to continue her work. She said she planned to hire three research assistants from three separate institutions as part of the project, along with summer undergraduate researchers. Those students are also now in limbo, waiting to hear if Rowen will be able to bring them aboard. She worries that if the government doesnít reopen soon, the students will be forced to find employment elsewhere. The delay has also impacted Rowenís ability to organize and pay for research trips she had planned for the spring and summer.ìItís sort of a first-world problem amongst all of the survival problems,î she said, referring to the financial hardships that tens of thousands of government workers now face because of missed paychecks. ìBut itís serious,î she said, showing the ripple effect the shutdown is having.The NSF is among several government agencies that fund research grants. And derailing the flow of grant money is just one of many ways that the shutdown has stymied scientific research around the country. Thousands of scientists remained furloughed across agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey.Meanwhile, the administration has managed to forge ahead with fossil fuel development in its relentless push for so-called ìenergy dominance.î The Interior Department is continuing to process oil and gas drilling applications and permits and recently amended the Bureau of Ocean Energy Managementís shutdown contingency plan to bring back dozens of furloughed employees to continue work on offshore drilling activities. Approximately 90 percent of NSFís 2,100-person workforce is furloughed, an agency spokeswoman said. At least 250 postdoctoral research fellows have gone without their stipends. The agency has had to cancel job interviews for key positions, including head of the Office of Information and Resource Management. And it was unable to send staff to a number of recent science conferences, including those of the American Astronomical Society and the American Meteorological Society. Among the many grants and awards that have been delayed are a batch of more than 180 small business innovation awards that were ready to go out when appropriations lapsed. Additionally, NSF has been forced to cancel dozens of review panels, groups of independent scientists and experts that evaluate grant proposals. The NSF makes decisions to fund or reject proposals based on these recommendations.†More than 100 panels were scheduled to review nearly 2,000 scientific proposals between Jan. 7 and Jan. 25, according to NSF.†Those included panels for chemistry, earth sciences, astronomical sciences and molecular and cellular biosciences. NSFís Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences has previously funded research looking at ways to target bacteria like E.coli and on bacteria that could help mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, Corbs told HuffPost. An NSF spokeswoman called the situation ìunprecedentedî and said the agency doesnít yet know the full extent of the shutdownís effects. †When the political standoff does finally end, NSF will have to tackle weeks of backlogged work in addition to everything on its regular agenda, which includes dozens of review panel meetings on the books for February and March. The rescheduling effort will be a ìmess to untangle,î Corbs said.ìWe will never know exactly which funding opportunities have been lost because of this shutdown, but we can be assured that American science [continues] to be hurt,î he said.Rowen, who was invited to be on a review panel in March, fears the shutdown could set science research, universities and careers back years. Universities rely on a stagnant pool of federal grant money to pay salaries and fund research. Roughly one-quarter of Rowenís $500,000 grant is to go toward operating costs at the multiple universities she has partnered with for the project.†ìI have little doubt that the hold-up of NSF funding will cost jobs and cause ripple effects in university administration,î Rowen said in a text message.†These outside awards can make or break a career, she added. It was an NSF grant that funded her dissertation research at the University of California, Berkeley, which she says ultimately led to a job in academics.ìItís huge for people who are scholars to not have the certainty around this,î Rowen said.This article had been updated to reflect the changing value of grants that NSF distributed over the same period last year.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

There will not be any infrastructure package.ìWhen he tries to be presidential, it just isnít believable,î said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. ìEven when he speaks rationally, no one trusts him. And he owns that.îA senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity at the insistence of the White House, said Trumpís third address to a joint session of Congress would be ìan inspiring vision of American greatness,î claiming the address would be both ìoptimisticî and ìunifying.îYet Trumpís two previous such speeches ó the State of the Union last January and a 2017 address five weeks after taking office ó called for unity, only to be followed by actions and statements that appealed primarily to the roughly 35 percent of the country that supports him strongly.In his 2017 speech ó during which a frequent critic declared, ìHe became president of the United States in that momentî ó Trump said in his prepared remarks, ìThe time for trivial fights is behind us.îJust two days later, he called an FBI investigation into his campaignís ties to Russia a ìwitch hunt.î Two days after that, he made the ó false ó accusation that his predecessor ìwire tappedî his Trump Tower home and that Democratic congressional leaders should also be investigated for their ties to Russia. (He also attacked Arnold Schwarzenegger for having poor ratings hosting ìThe Apprentice,î the reality TV show that Trump rode to national prominence.)On Jan. 30, 2018, reading words off a teleprompter that others had written for him, Trump said,†ìTonight, I call upon on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.îJust 33 hours later, Trump wrote on Twitter, ìNOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in í18.î He subsequently attacked Democrats and urged his audiences to vote Republican at both official†and campaign events for the next nine months.ìThis president, however much he may try, however much he calls for unity, however much he calls for working together for the common good, those words just fall on deaf ears. He ruined that brand as part of his initial brand,î said Jolly. ìAll of his calls tomorrow will be ruined by a tweet attacking the one person he needs, [Democratic House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.îApart from the tone, the contents of Trumpís address may also be undone by inaction in the coming year.In his 2017 speech, for example, Trump called for a $1 trillion package to rebuild the countryís roads, bridges and ports. In 2018 he called for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending. In neither year did his White House deliver a detailed infrastructure proposal to Capitol Hill.In 2017 his White House suggested taking $200 billion from other programs and somehow leveraging that with private-sector money to total $1 trillion, but never made any serious legislative proposal. In 2018 the White House made no serious infrastructure effort at all.Rick Wilson, a longtime Trump critic and Republican political consultant, said trying to analyze either the tone or the content of the presidentís remarks is a waste of time. Because he is so prone to falsehoods and his administration is so bad with follow-up on policy matters, Wilson said, what Trump says is of no consequence, in any event.ìItís going to be: ëMe, me, me. Build my wall, build my wall, build my wall. The economy is great,íî Wilson said.Trumpís speech in the House chamber was originally scheduled for Jan. 29 but was postponed by Pelosi because of the partial government shutdown. Trump, after 35 days, backed down from his insistence that he would not reopen the government unless Democrats supported spending billions for a border wall that he originally promised Mexico would pay for.But the spending bill Trump signed on Jan. 25 runs out on Feb. 15. If a new appropriations bill is not signed into law by then, about a quarter of the government could again shut down. He has threatened to allow that, but has also raised the possibility that he will declare a ìnational emergencyî to build the wall, using money appropriated for other purposes.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) broadcast a populist message focused around a desire for greater racial and economic justice in the U.S. on Tuesday night, just an hour before President Donald Trumpís State of the Union address.ìLetís fight for an America where the economy works for working people <U+2015> an America where health care and education are fundamental rights, not a privilege for the wealthy few,î she said. Speaking for only seven minutes on Facebook Live, Harris broached topics including health care, housing, education, wage stagnation, immigration, gun violence, the 2017 Republican tax bill, deregulation and Trumpís travel ban.ìWe also need our leaders to speak truth about the threat of climate change, about our broken criminal justice system, about our weakened position in the world and about the realities of racism, sexism, anti-semitism, homophobia and transphobia,î she said. On what would have been the 24th birthday of Trayvon Martin <U+2015> the unarmed Florida teenager who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012, sparking mass protests and outrage <U+2015> Harris spoke of ìan America where no mother or father has to teach their son that people may stop him or kill him because of the color of his skin <U+2015> and where no parent has to send their child to school with a bulletproof backpack.îHarris deliberately set herself apart from the president, predicting that Trump would deliver a speech Tuesday night that ìseeks to score political points by driving us apart.îìThe strength of our union has never been found in the walls we build,î she said. ìItís in our diversity and our unity, and that is our power.îìWhen you hear claims that our problems would all be solved if we just built a wall on our southern border, donít forget the babies ripped from their parentsí arms and the refugees fleeing violence and abuse who are being turned away,î she said.The Republican National Committee criticized Harrisí Tuesday comments in a statement sent to HuffPost, describing her as ìblinded by her opposition to President Trump.î<U+2033>[B]efore he can speak about his bipartisan agenda at the State of the Union, she tried to advance her divisive leftist agenda of government-run health care, higher taxes, and open borders,î RNC spokesman Steve Guest said in a statement.†Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is scheduled to deliver the Democratsí rebuttal immediately after Trumpís address, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who will provide his own response to Trump for the third straight year.Since Harris told ABCís ìGood Morning Americaî that she was running for president last month, she has pulled off the most successful campaign rollout of any Democratic hopeful this cycle, in the eyes of many political operatives. Within 24 hours, she raised $1.5 million. Over the next week, she appeared on MSNBCís ìThe Rachel Maddow Show,î presented her policy views during a CNN town hall, paid a visit to some of her sorority sisters in South Carolina and stood in front of more than 20,000 people at a rally in her hometown of Oakland, California.This month, Harris plans to keep campaigning with stops in each of the first four states to hold a Democratic nominating contest <U+2015> Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina <U+2015> according to her press secretary.Harris has said her State of the Union guest will be Trisha Pesiri-Dybvik, a California mother of three whose home was destroyed by the Thomas Fire in 2017. More recently, her family faced a crisis of another sort when it went about a month without a paycheck during the partial government shutdown, which affected her and her husband. (They are both air traffic controllers.)ìShe is the definition of resilience and Iím proud to have her here with me,î Harris said earlier Tuesday.Tuesday night, Harris preached a message of unity. ìI believe we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation,î Harris said. ìItís a moment where we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we?

In January, Senate Republicans released a draft bill that would severely restrict the refugee asylum program. Last year, the administration followed through with a proposal that makes it harder for migrants to get green cards if they are poor or could become poor.Less than three weeks earlier, Trump reopened the federal government after he failed to reach an agreement with Democrats to fund his multibillion-dollar barrier at the southern border. At 35 days, it was the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history, and it forced about 800,000 federal workers to go without compensation.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Thereís talk of ìbanning billionaires,î and in the U.S. there are serious <U+2015> and popular <U+2015> policy proposals looking at how to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy, most notably from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).††Americans have actually long supported raising taxes on the wealthy, surveys† show. But for years, the ultra-rich, Republicans and anti-tax extremists like Grover Norquist have kept that popular sentiment at bay, partly with rhetoric about freedom and partly by philanthropic deeds, not to mention good PR to portray themselves as benevolent, self-made geniuses.Now that Trumpís in office. The tide has turned.ìThe current occupant of the White House has rather taken the sheen off the billionaires,î said Justin Wolfers, an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan. ìItís easier today to believe that a bunch of them are grifters rather than the value-creating entrepreneurs that we might hope for.îIn the past, Americans wanted to tax the rich to pay for specific policies. These days, the reasoning goes that taxing the ultra-wealthy will tamp down extreme inequality, said Matt Grossmann, a political science professor at Michigan State University.ìYouíre seeing more willingness to say itís just a moral issue that someone shouldnít start out with that much of an advantage in life,î he said.The recent popularity of tax-the-rich policies isnít simply a reaction to Trump, Grossman added, but part of a natural tendency in American politics for public opinion to swing in opposition to whichever party is in power. ìPublic opinion moves ëthermostatically,íî he said. ìWhen Republicans are in office and policy moves to the right, public opinion moves leftward.î Still, itís fair to say that the Democratic Partyís reaction to Trump has been more extreme than it wouldíve been under, say, a President Jeb Bush. Trump has energized progressives on issues, like womenís rights, in resistance to the president, which has inspired record numbers of women to run for office. Heís also been a catalyst for environmental issues, in a way. Before Trump took office, activists and scientists had trouble getting attention for climate issues, but now itís become much easier, in part thanks to opposition to Trump, †FiveThirtyEight recently reported.Of course, there are a host of other non-Trump reasons why tax-the-rich ideas are taking off now, including a rise in economic inequality that is hard to ignore and the work of economists, such as†Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, whoíve been able to demonstrate, with hard data, how bad the situation has become. Thereís also the lingering effects of the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, which pushed Democrats to the left on these issues. Sanders proposed raising taxes on wealthy Americans and railed against income inequality. †And outrage over inequality really hasnít gone away since the Great Recession a decade ago led to the protests of Occupy Wall Street.In the background, as these longer-term trends play out, is our super-rich president and his super-rich Cabinet.†Theyíve demonstrated repeatedly how out of touch they are with regular people.Most recently, during the partial†government shutdown, the multimillionaire (and reported grifter) Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had his ìlet them eat cakeî moment when he told CNBC that he couldnít understand why furloughed workers would go to food banks when they could instead get loans to carry them through the loss of pay.Trump himself helped further along the out-of-touch narrative by claiming that grocery stores would work with these unpaid government employees to help them get food if they were short on cash.†Former Goldman Sachs executive and millionaire Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchinís wife, Louise Linton,†caught flak in 2017 for comments she made online essentially boasting about the taxes she and her husband pay. ìPretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than youíd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours,î she commented on an Instagram post, responding to someone who had criticized her.Beyond image, keep in mind that Trumpís singular policy achievement is a massive tax cut that has mostly benefited corporations. Bloomberg recently reported that the nationís largest banks got a $21 billion ìwindfallî from the legislation but wound up cutting employees anyway.Finally, Trumpís set himself apart from all other modern presidents by keeping his tax returns private <U+2015> inadvertently perhaps shining a light on how the rich often get away with not paying their fair share. ìPoliticians can come to embody problems that exist,î said Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University. ìThe president all of a sudden becomes a walking reminder of the issue.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

They include former†Deutsche Bank executive Christopher Bancroft Burnham, who served on Trumpís State Department transition team.†Deripaska†and Trump†have both been clients of Deutsche Bank.

But by then the measure had already failed in the GOP-controlled Senate.†Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), a longtime critic of lifting the sanctions, called it a ìsordid dealî on Twitter, adding that the Trump administration works seven days a week on ìfavoritism for Russia.î He also accused the president of being more concerned about helping Russian businesses than paying U.S. federal workers amid the newly ended government shutdown.NEW: Ignoring House disapproval of this sordid deal, refusing to have Secretary Mnuchin testify, & seeking to preempt Senate disapproval, Trump Admin works 7 days/week with favoritism for Russia.Discussed Trump's Russian sanctions relief in @nytimes: https://t.co/gcVcFDorlmRepresents yet one more step in undermining the sanctions law, which President Trump has obstructed at every opportunity.

The 35-year-old lost his refund both because Republicans targeted wealthy (and heavily Democratic) metropolitan areas for tax hikes and also because of how President Donald Trumpís administration implemented the law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut rates for taxpayers at every income level and simplified the tax code for most filers. Part of that simplification meant getting rid of a lot of deductions, which people use to reduce the amount of their taxable earnings. One of the most controversial changes limited the amount of state and local tax payments that could be deducted. Previously, a tax filer could reduce their federal taxable income by subtracting the income taxes they paid to their state and local governments. The law capped such deductions at $10,000. Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in state and local levies. While preparing to file his taxes through the H&R Block website this week, Williams said the blood drained from his face when he realized how much he would owe. He had anticipated getting another refund that he would put toward a vacation. ìI guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something,î he said. There is probably no way Williams could have avoided paying higher taxes, given his circumstances. But if the government had administered the tax law more carefully, he could have been spared the February surprise. Employers are supposed to withhold federal income tax from their workersí paychecks, and the vast majority of taxpayers typically withhold more than necessary, resulting in a refund in the early part of the year. The average refund is worth nearly $3,000. But Republicans rushed their tax cuts through Congress at the end of 2017, making huge changes to the tax code without so much as a hearing, and gave the IRS hardly any time to implement the law, which took effect less than two weeks after Trump signed it.The IRS had to scramble to figure how it should change the way tax would be withheld from paychecks for 2018. Officials with the Treasury Department told the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, that they felt they had to work with the same basic W-4 forms that employers were already using to determine withholding amounts. A trade group for payroll providers told the GAO that substantially different forms would necessitate changes to withholding software that would have taken at least half a year. The IRS knew from its simulations <U+2015> which assumed that people would not adjust their withholding amounts <U+2015> that just plugging new numbers into its old withholding tables would probably reduce the number of tax filers getting a refund from 76 percent to 73 percent, according to the July GAO report. The number that owed money would increase by a proportional amount.†That means millions more households getting a bill from the IRS.†In Treasuryís simulations, households that itemized deductions, such as New Yorkers with higher local taxes, were likelier to withhold less tax as a percentage of their total liability. ìThat is the group that ends up paying more tax under the new law,î said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. ìItís the people in New York who are losing such a large amount of the [state and local tax] deduction they can end up owing more tax because their taxable income goes up by so much.îTax filing season opened at the end of January, and the government shutdown may have hampered the IRSí ability to process returns as quickly as in previous years. Around this time in 2018, the IRS said it had processed 30 million returns and dished out 13 million refunds. (The total for the year was 150 million returns and 111 million refunds.) Similar data is not yet available for this year. The new law cut taxes for 80 percent of households, with the biggest benefit accruing to the wealthier ones, according to the Tax Policy Center, while roughly 5 percent saw a tax increase. The changes should have been evident in paychecks last year, though incorrect withholding may have obscured the policy until now. Republicans knew in advance that the households negatively affected by their tax changes just so happen to be clustered in states where people tend to vote for Democrats. And according to the GAO, the Trump administration may have been more worried about people withholding too much instead of too little, even though the latter can stick people with surprise tax bills and penalties, and reduces overall compliance. Withholding too little, on the other hand, makes peopleís paychecks bigger immediately <U+2015> and the Trump administration wanted to make sure to help the people it intended to help.ìTreasury officials stated that withholding more from paychecks than in past years for taxpayers whose tax liability is expected to decrease would be inconsistent with the intent of the law as they understood it,î the GAO said.HuffPost readers: Tax bill surprise?

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) asked Whitaker whether he was involved in the January decision of the DOJís Office of Legal Counsel to alter an established legal interpretation of the Federal Wire Act in order to further limit online gambling and whether he had any communications with Adelson or any of the billionaireís lobbyists. The new opinion reversed a 2011 OLC interpretation of the act that had applied a prohibition on online gambling strictly to online betting on sports. State officials fear that the expanded ban could imperil their online gaming industries and even negatively impact the administration of state lotteries.Whitaker said that he was not involved in the decision and that he has never personally met with or spoken to Adelson.ìYour inference that somehow that process was corrupted or corrupt is absolutely wrong and the premise of your question I reject,î the acting attorney general said.Raskin was not satisfied with Whitakerís answers. The congressman and constitutional law professor told HuffPost that he would submit more questions to Whitaker about the OLC interpretation after Fridayís hearing.ìThis definitely bears further investigation,î Raskin said. ìWhen and where and by whom remains to be seen.îThe investigation may come from officials in states with legalized online gaming, Raskin said. The OLCís sudden change of heart caused some of them to wonder whether any improper influence from Adelson, the biggest political benefactor of the president and the Republican Party, had affected that new take on the law.Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, pumped at least $205 million into campaign and party committees and super PACs to support Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, according to Federal Election Commission records. The biggest contributions from the Adelsons went to super PACs that helped elect Trump and congressional Republicans. The couple donated $85 million to a super PAC supporting Senate Republicans, $70 million to a super PAC helping elect House Republicans and $30 million to two pro-Trump super PACs. Sheldon Adelson was also a major funder of a dark money nonprofit group that helped Trump win the 2016 election, according to The New York Times.More recently, the Adelsons contributed $500,000 to a legal defense fund set up for Trump and his associates who are being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. They were the only donors to the fund.The revised legal interpretation, issued during the partial federal government shutdown, relied on materials submitted to the Justice Departmentís lawyers by lobbyists for a group set up by Adelson, according to The Washington Post.Now some of the affected states are fighting back. The Justice Department should ìwithdraw its opinionî because it rests on faulty legal grounding and could undermine state laws regulating online gaming and lotteries, argued a Feb. 5 letter to the DOJ from New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Grewal and Shapiro also issued a Freedom of Information Act request for any communications between the department and Adelson and his lobbyists.Besides the new interpretation itself, questions are being raised about its timing. Whitaker and others from the DOJ met with White House officials during the government shutdown to tell them of the plan to issue the new interpretation, according to The Intercept. This meeting came ahead of the Senateís confirmation hearing for William Barr, Trumpís choice for a permanent attorney general. Barr had previously stated that he had no interest in reversing the 2011 OLC opinion.Since 2014, Adelson, the owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation <U+2015> which runs casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore <U+2015> has led an effort to persuade politicians in Washington to ban all online gambling. The 85-year-old billionaire argues that the legalization of online gaming will hurt the bottom line for casinos. Banning or restricting online gaming, on the other hand, would hurt his competitors like MGM that invested in the new industry after the 2011 ruling.So Adelson launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and hired a bevy of revolving-door lobbyists, including former Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and former Republican Gov. George Pataki of New York. Social conservatives like Ralph Reed were encouraged to rally the grassroots. The lobbying group doesnít campaign on the grounds that Adelsonís hefty pocketbook may suffer from online gaming. Instead, the coalition argues that online gaming is bad for the children.The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling initially sought to pass federal legislation to achieve its goal. But bills introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) floundered in Congress amid opposition from both parties and lobbying from those casino companies that had invested in online gaming. Adelsonís lobbying group then focused on convincing the Justice Department to simply issue a new legal opinion overturning the old one.Charles Cooper, a Washington lawyer working for Adelson, lobbied the Justice Department, sending a memo in 2017 that made the legal argument for upending the 2011 opinion, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.Januaryís reversal wasnít the first big victory for Adelson under the Trump administration. Adelson is a longtime supporter of right-wing political parties in Israel and the idea of locating the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. In May 2018, he was a guest of honor at the†opening of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem after Trump decided to move it from Tel Aviv.The Trump administrationís decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal was also sought by Adelson, who had previously suggested the U.S. use its own nuclear weapons to destroy Iranís nascent nuclear program. Trump†lobbied Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe†on behalf of Adelsonís efforts to liberalize Japanís gaming laws and allow him to expand his Asian casino operations. And last year Trump awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nationís highest civilian honor, just one month after she contributed to his legal defense fund.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Trump has insisted he will not agree to any deal unless it includes money for a wall. But Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) flatly told reporters Thursday: ìThereís not going to be any wall money in the legislation.îThe temporary funding bill that re-opened parts of the government expires Feb. 15.ìWe will be looking at a national emergency because I donít think anythingís going to happenî concerning an agreement, Trump told reporters at the White House.Some GOP legislators have already spoken out against an emergency declaration ó and against another government shutdown. GOP Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said that an emergency declaration was a ìterrible ideaî and that he would oppose it. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said last month that to ìgive the president authority basically to do that all by himself would, I think, stretch constitutional boundaries.îMcConnell has expressed support for some kind of negotiated agreement.†ìIím for whatever works, which means avoiding a shutdown and avoiding the president feeling he should declare a national emergency,î McConnell said in his weekly news conference in the Capitol.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

In the past, heís made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall.In 2016, while Trump was still a presidential candidate, Francis responded to a reporterís question about Trumpís proposed border wall by suggesting that ìa person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.îIn 2017, days after Trump released the first iteration of a travel ban temporarily halting refugee admissions and blocking immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Francis issued another strong indictment of walls.ìIn the social and civil context as well, I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,î he said during a catechism lesson.Catholic youth groups from around the globe attend World Youth Day, which is held every two to three years.

Amy Klobucharís nascent 2020 presidential campaign ó and done so in part because of the Minnesota Democratís history of mistreating her staff, HuffPost has learned.Klobuchar, who plans to make an announcement about a potential presidential bid on Sunday in Minneapolis,†has spent the past several months positioning herself to run for president.†Sheís beloved in her state as a smart, funny and personable lawmaker and has gained national attention for her lines of questioning at high-profile hearings.But some former Klobuchar staffers, all of whom spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity, describe Klobuchar as habitually demeaning and prone to bursts of cruelty that make it difficult to work in her office for long.†It is common for staff to wake up to multiple emails from Klobuchar characterizing oneís work as ìthe worstî briefing or press release sheíd seen in her decades of public service, according to two former aides and emails seen by HuffPost.Although some staffers grew inured to her constant put-downs (ìItís always ëthe worst,íî one said sarcastically, ìëIt was ëthe worstí one two weeks agoî), others found it grinding and demoralizing. Adding to the humiliation, Klobuchar often ccíd large groups of staffers who werenít working on the topic at hand, giving the emails the effect of a public flogging.ìSenator Klobuchar loves her staff <U+2015> they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today,î a campaign spokesperson told HuffPost. ìShe has many staff who have been with her for years <U+2015> including her Chief of Staff and her State Director, who have worked for her for 5 and 7 years respectively <U+2015> and many who have gone on to do amazing things, from working in the Obama Administration (over 20 of them) to running for office to even serving as the Agriculture Commissioner for Minnesota. She is proud of them and the work they have done for Minnesota.îSome people who worked for Klobuchar say they valued the experience: Klobuchar has an unrivaled command of details, puts in long, enthusiastic hours, and simply demands that her office meet those same high standards, several former staffers maintained. Those employees described working for her as a challenge, but an exhilarating one that caused them to grow and perform their best work. They question whether former co-workers who thought she was abusive were falling for sexist stereotypes about female leaders with high standards.†Reached for comment, Klobucharís office referred HuffPost to multiple ex-staffers who shared glowing statements about working for her.ìIíve heard people say sheís tough to work for and I sometimes cringe when I hear it because I rarely hear that said about male bosses in Congress despite the fact that half of Congress is tough to work for,î said Tristan Brown, a former legislative aide who called Klobuchar ìprobably the most brilliant, hardworking person Iíve had the privilege to work for.îErik Garcia Luna, who worked in Klobucharís Minneapolis office from 2009 to 2014, remembers her as kind. He said that she called her staffers during the 2013 government shutdown to check in with them and make sure they and their families were taken care of.†He said he had no idea why there were such divergent views from people who had worked for the senator: ìI donít know what to make of them, to be frank.îDo you have more information on what itís like to work for Sen. Klobuchar ó or other members of Congress? Get in touch: scoops@huffpost.comWhat is indisputable, however, is that Klobucharís office consistently has one of the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate. Klobucharís rate of turnover ranked No. 1 in an analysis of all Senate staff salaries between†2001 and 2016,†conducted†by LegiStorm, a widely used database of congressional staff salaries.†(Klobuchar was sworn into office in 2007.)†Sheís now third, behind Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen and Louisiana Republican John Kennedy.†And this is not the first time Klobuchar has had issues building a team because of worries about her mistreatment of staff.A former employee in her Senate office recalled her struggling to find an outside candidate to replace an outgoing chief of staff. A staffer in another Hill office recounted losing interest in a job opening with Klobuchar when a current staffer, the one conducting the interview, conveyed that avoiding Klobucharís anger was a significant part of the job.The senator has acknowledged she has ìhigh expectations,î but many people who have worked with Klobuchar or interacted with her and her staff say her treatment of staff goes beyond the normal expectations of excelling in a job.†Three former staffers said Klobuchar has tasked them or their co-workers with performing personal errands, such as making her personal appointments, washing dishes at her home or picking up her dry cleaning.Senate staff are generally†prohibited by Senate ethics rules from performing personal duties for members.However, the practice is also common on Capitol Hill. A former staffer who was never aware of Klobuchar tasking a staffer with personal chores said many lawmakers make such requests. ìThe honest truth to this is, there are a lot of people [in Congress] who really take advantage of office staff,î the former staffer said.In egregious cases, members of the House of Representatives who violated rules against personal use of staff have been subject to ethics investigations.The reality of working for Klobuchar is at odds with the Midwestern-nice image she has cultivated in public: an unflappable workhorse and ìthe senator next door,î which was the title of her 2015 memoir.One morning several years ago, when most of the office staff was running late ó the ex-staffer couldnít remember the reason ó Klobuchar wrote out tardy slips and placed them on each missing aideís desk. The staffer recalls incredulous bursts of laughter as her co-workers arrived one by one to find the notes, but Klobuchar was deadly serious. An aide whom she called into her office walked back out in tears.ìShe was constantly lighting new fires,î a former staffer said, sometimes at the expense of focusing on legislative work.ìWhen you have people who donít want to work for you, you canít be as effective,î the staffer added.Kevin Robillard contributed reporting.

Attendees also prayed at various times throughout the session.†Thomas, who operates a one-woman political consultancy,†has been criticized in recent months for pushing more obviously partisan messages than some deem appropriate for the spouse of a justice of the Supreme Court, an institution that has recently seen its impartiality questioned.Over Facebook, she regularly posts unvarnished praise for Trump and slams Democratic leadership. This week, she†shared a racist meme about immigrants. (Not her first.) Thomas once called the Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivors ìdangerous to the survival of our nationî because of their battle for stronger gun control policy.†Others at the meeting were Connie Hair, chief of staff to Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas); Frank Gaffney, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist; and Rosemary Jenks, who works for the anti-immigration group NumbersUSA <U+2015> along with around six White House aides, the Times reported.Thomas and Hair were particularly hung up on certain administrative appointments they wanted Trump to make, accusing White House aides of blocking them, according to the report.†One woman present reportedly argued that all women should be barred from military service due to their physical differences from men.Someone also told the president that Republican congressional leaders should be ìtarred and featheredî over the partial government shutdown, although the attendees apparently did not say what the leaders should have been doing.†While news of the meeting comes just after the White House agreed to temporarily reopen the federal government, at the time the shutdown would have seemed indefinite.†At one point, Trump pulled his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also a White House aide, into the meeting, ìsaying she would be beloved if she were serving a liberal president, instead of getting negative news coverage.îThe unusual meeting reportedly came to be after the president and first lady dined with the justice and his wife but had been delayed for months, the Times said.††Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He then sentenced each of the defendants to at least 25 years in federal prison.Three Kansas men <U+2015> Curtis Allen, Patrick Stein and Gavin Wright <U+2015> were†convicted last April†on weapons of mass destruction and civil rights charges for plotting to bomb a Garden City, Kansas, apartment complex predominantly occupied by Somali refugees.†U.S. District Judge Eric Melgren sentenced Allen, a 52-year-old Iraq War veteran, to 25 years in prison plus 10 years of supervised release on Friday. Stein <U+2015> who used some of the most extreme rhetoric in the case <U+2015> received 30 years behind bars. Wright was sentenced to 26 years in prison.Stein did not offer any direct apology for his actions at his sentencing, and the judge said he did not appear to feel any remorse.†ìI take full responsibility for everything I said and everything I did. Nobody forced me to do any of it,î Stein said before Melgren imposed his sentence.Allen, however, did seem to show remorse. He had prepared remarks but was unable to finish them without breaking down.†ìIím just ashamed of myself, and Iím sorry,î he said. The federal public defenders representing Allen argued in a sentencing memo that his ìmisguided patriotism was inflamed by the rhetoric of the 2016 political climate and the influence of the Russian information warfare campaign against the American people.î They cited extremist Facebook ads and pages that he likely saw on his feed that turned out to be part of a Russian propaganda operation meant to boost Trumpís campaign.ìI did a lot of eye rolling, candidly, when reading that in the briefs,î Melgren said Friday.†He said that he didnít want to downplay foreign interference in the election but that by running ads, the Russians ìwere doing nothing moreî than what political campaigns did on a regular basis. He said that only someone who wasnít a student of U.S. history could say that the 2016 campaign season was particularly heated. îWeíve had highly charged campaigns before,î he said.Attorneys for the men asked the judge to consider Trumpís rhetoric about Muslims when sentencing them.Rich Federico, a federal public defender representing Allen, said that the defense team was ìnot blaming the Russians hereî but that many of the ads that Allen viewed on Facebook were later revealed to be part of Russiaís propaganda campaign and they could have had an influence on his conduct.Federal prosecutors wanted all three defendants to spend the rest of their lives behind bars. ìThe defendants stand before the Court convicted of a conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction to commit a mass murder that would send both a message and a threat: that Muslims are not welcome in America, and, unless the U.S. Government changed its immigration policies, more carnage would follow,î they wrote in a sentencing memorandum.†Melgren ruled on Jan. 15 that terrorism enhancements and civil rights enhancements should apply in the case but decided to impose sentences outside the sentencing guidelines (which call for life imprisonment).Steinís lawyers, who argued that he was caught up in the ìchaosî environment of 2016, said the context of Trumpís anti-Muslim rhetoric was impossible to ignore.ìThe court cannot ignore the circumstances of one of the most rhetorically mold-breaking, violent, awful, hateful and contentious presidential elections in modern history, driven in large measure by the rhetorical China shop bull who is now our president,î they wrote in a sentencing memo.Wrightís attorneys also emphasized the impact of Trumpís anti-Muslim rhetoric.ìIntellectual honesty requires this Court to confront a certain reality. As long as the White House with impunity calls Islam ëa dangerous threat,í and paints average Americans as ëvictims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad,í a mixed signal gets sent,î they wrote. ìThe President warns Americans that radical Muslims are ëtrying to take over our children.í The Commander-in-Chief exonerates violent extremists in Charlottesville as ëgood people,í while claiming that Muslims ëby and largeí want to ësubjugateí the rest of the world.îAs long as the executive branch ìcondemns Islam and commends and encourages violence against would-be enemies, then a sentence imposed by the Judicial Branch does little to deter people generally from engaging in such conduct if they believe they are protecting their countries from enemies identified by their own Commander-in-Chief,î Wrightís attorneys argued.(Because of the partial government shutdown over Trumpís demand for billions of taxpayer dollars for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, federal prosecutors and FBI agents have been working the case without getting paid. On Friday the president announced a deal to reopen the government through Feb. 15†while negotiations continue over the wall and other border security issues.)This story has been updated to include details from the sentencing hearings.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Great!îNumerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!He posted the tweet soon after a ìFox & Friendsî segment reporting that at least six states <U+2015> North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia and Florida <U+2015> have seen the introduction of Bible literacy legislation this year.†North Dakota state Rep. Aaron McWilliams, who is co-sponsoring a Bible literacy measure, appeared on the conservative talk show Monday morning to defend these bills.Under his bill, the Bible courses would be entirely optional for schools to offer and for students to take, McWilliams said. The classes, he explained, would explore the Bibleís influence on history, legal systems, Americaís founding fathers <U+2015> and other much broader concepts.ìThe concept of forgiveness, the concept of recompense, these are things that all come from the Bible,î McWilliams said. ìIf we donít have a good foundational understanding of this, weíre not going to understand how the founding fathers of our country and other countries put it together to have the world that we have today.îWatch the ìFox & Friendsî segment with McWilliams below.Trumpís approval of Bible literacy classes drew backlash from some of his critics on Twitter, with many chiming in to question his scriptural bona fides.The president, who identifies as a Presbyterian, has repeatedly claimed that the Bible is his favorite book. Yet heís had a few public blunders when asked to display his own knowledge of the Scriptures. He said in 2016 that his favorite Bible verse is the one that demands ìan eye for an eyeî as punishment for crimes. But that verse from Exodus was later†specifically addressed by Jesus, who told his followers to ìturn the other cheekî to their enemies instead.During a visit to Liberty University the same year, Trump famously referred to the biblical book Second Corinthians as ìTwo Corinthians,î eliciting some snickers from students at the evangelical school.Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, a longtime Trump ally who helped craft the Liberty University speech, later admitted that the presidential candidateís botched reference ìshows that heís not familiar with the Bible.îTrumpís ability to quote Scripture appears to have improved after he was elected to the White House, including in speeches after the†Las Vegas†and Parkland, Florida, mass shootings.††Still, some Christian and Jewish Americans suggested on Monday that there were other Bible verses the president should familiarize himself with.†Some pointed out that the Bible calls on people of faith to welcome the stranger <U+2015> something Trumpís critics believe his immigration policies have failed to do.Bible literacy?

The effort had been more successful the previous year in Kentucky, where lawmakers passed a bill†that allowed Bible courses to be taught in public schools. The ACLU contends that, in practice, these classes in Kentucky often flout constitutional restrictions that prohibit public school teachers from proselytizing students.†Americans United for Separation of Church and State says these bills are part of a larger coordinated campaign by†Christian nationalist groups. The effort, dubbed†Project Blitz, seeks to flood state legislatures across the country with centrally crafted ìmodelî bills that promote conservative Christian views.Along with the Bible literacy bills, thereís been a recent push to have the national motto ìIn God We Trustî posted on public property, including public schools. Lawmakers in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina and Indiana have already introduced ìIn God We Trustî bills this year.†Project Blitz has also been associated with bills that seek to allow workers in the private and public sectors to deny service to LGBTQ people and others based on the workersí religious beliefs.†ìAs evidenced by Project Blitz, the goal of these [Biblical literacy] bills is not to have an objective discussion about the Bible at all but to promote Christianity and ultimately to push a more aggressive political agenda that allows religion to be used to discriminate,î Laser said.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Al Sharpton called Donald Trump the ìmost insensitive president weíve seen in our lifetime.îSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) branded Trumpís election a ìgiant step backî for all the things Martin Luther King Jr. believed in.Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) dubbed Trump ìa reality TV star trying to drag us into an episode.îBut at the National Action Networkís annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Harlem, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffriesí (D-N.Y.) anti-Trump riff left the biggest mark.ìThese are challenging times in the United States of America. We have a hater in the White House: the birther in chief, the grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,î Jeffries said, referencing the head position of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan. The remark drew guffaws and cheers from the hundreds of people in attendance.ìOne of the things that weíve learned is that while Jim Crow might be dead, heís still got some nieces and nephews who are alive and well,î Jeffries added.The comments, which immediately went viral on social media, reflected the degree to which Democrats were using the national holiday commemorating the birth of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. to paint Trump and Republicans as enemies of Kingís vision.Of course, Trump has given Democrats ample ammunition <U+2015> not merely in his long record of racist comments and hard-line immigration policies, but also in his response to MLK Day this year.††Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited the King monument in Washington on Monday following criticism that the White House had not planned any official events to mark the holiday.Sharpton lit into Trump over the absence of events at an MLK Day event in Washington on Monday morning and again in Harlem that afternoon, calling the last-minute gesture a ìdrive-by,î since Trump was driven there in a hastily planned visit.Sharpton also noted the irony that MLK Day comes during the longest-ever partial shutdown of the federal government. King was assassinated while advocating for striking Memphis, Tennessee, sanitation workers <U+2015> public employees just like the 800,000 federal workers who have missed at least one paycheck so far due to the shutdown.ìThere could be nothing more offensive to the legacy of Martin Luther Kingî than to keep those workers from getting paid on time, Sharpton said.The Trump administration seemed to invite these kinds of comparisons themselves. Speaking on CBSí ìFace the Nationî on Sunday, Pence argued that Kingís leadership should inspire a resolution to the impasse over border wall funding that has kept the government shutdown going.ìOne of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, ëNow is the time to make real the promises of democracy,íî he said. ìYou think of how he changed America; he inspired us to change through the legislative process.îIn recent years, progressive politicians and activists have sought to restore Kingís legacy to its radical roots, which they argue has been sanitized to exclude the controversial beliefs he espoused toward the end of his life. King elicited ire from many of his onetime establishment allies for speaking out so vocally against the Vietnam War and for the kinds of social democratic policies he believed were necessary to eradicate poverty.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) was one of the speakers at the National Action Network celebration to highlight Kingís less well-known quest for economic equality. ìItís not the whole Dr. King that a lot of times is remembered,î de Blasio said. ìDr. King spoke about a struggle for justice, and not just racial justice, as I said ó he believed you could not have racial justice without economic justice.îDe Blasio used the occasion to tout the cityís plans to guarantee health care to all residents. He also announced that in the interest of trying to ìlive in Dr. Kingís image in todayís world,î the city planned to mandate two weeks of annual paid time off for every New York City worker.ìHere in this city, weíre going to lead the way. Weíre going to show what can be done,î de Blasio declared. ìWeíre going to show that working people will get the wages they deserve, the benefits they deserve, the life they deserve.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But Democrats are far from convinced that Barr <U+2015> whoís been nominated to replace frequent Trump foil and former Attorney General†Jeff Sessions <U+2015> would protect the Russia probe, and plan to use Barrís confirmation hearing on Tuesday to extract additional commitments.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) <U+2015> in a letter†obtained by HuffPost that the senator hand-delivered to the 68-year-old Barr at a meeting on Thursday <U+2015> laid out several lines of questioning ahead of Barrís appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning. Whitehouse raised a number of questions he had for Barr about his communications with the Trump White House, Justice Department officials, and Trumpís legal team.Whitehouseís letter zeroes in on an unsolicited June 8, 2018 memorandum that Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose†anticipated departure has only heightened Democratic concerns about Barrís appointment. Barrís 19-page memo suggested that it wasnít legitimate for Mueller to investigate whether the president obstructed justice by pressuring former FBI Director James Comey†to drop the FBI investigation of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.†In the letter, Whitehouse also raised concerns that Trump might want Barr to play the role of Robert Bork, the former solicitor general who <U+2015> after Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest <U+2015> followed President Richard Nixonís order to fire independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox as he investigated Nixonís role in Watergate. Whitehouse wrote about an agreement that Bork, then acting attorney general, signed in the wake of what became known as the ìSaturday Night Massacreî that offered assurances about the independence of Leon Jaworkski, who replaced Cox as special prosecutor.††ìYour agreement to follow in the footsteps of Robert Bork would provide significant assurances to those who fear your appointment is a prelude to another Saturday Night Massacre,î Whitehouse wrote to Barr.Barrís confirmation hearing should make for compelling television. The Senate Judiciary Committee, now chaired by frequent Trump defender Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), includes several prominent Democrats, including a few who are expected to seek the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The hearing is taking place as the nearly 20-month-old Mueller probe enters a pivotal stage, as Mueller appears to be wrapping up his investigation and preparing a highly anticipated report on his conclusions that might jump-start a movement to impeach Trump in the Democratic-controlled House.†And it all comes amid an ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left much of the Justice Department Barr hopes to head furloughed or working without pay.†Republicans control the Senate with 53 members, so Democrats canít do much to stop his confirmation on their own. But they can press Barr for commitments to insure the independence of the Mueller investigation as it enters a crucial timeframe.Barr, in prepared remarks provided to reporters ahead of Tuesdayís hearing, seemed to be operating under the notion that he would seize control of the Mueller investigation after his confirmation. His prepared opening remarks make no reference to consulting with career ethics officials within DOJ about whether his unsolicited memo about the Mueller probe created an appearance of impropriety that might suggest he should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who defended Trump on cable news before joining the Justice Department, rejected the advice of a DOJ ethics official who suggested he should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation. Whitaker, who was not confirmed by the Senate during the Trump administration, had faced questions over the legitimacy of his unprecedented appointment as acting attorney general following Sessionsí forced resignation†after the 2018 midterms.Barrís opening statement, however, operates on the assumption that he would in fact be in charge of the Mueller investigation upon his confirmation.ìIf confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper considerations to interfere with this or any other investigation,î Barr will say in his prepared remarks. ìI will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work.îBarr will also tell senators that he didnít pursue the position, and that he was ìreluctant to be consideredî when his name first came up because heís 68, ìpartially retired, and nearing the end of a long legal career.î Heíll say that he and his wife were looking forward to spending time with their family, note that heíd already had the gig before, and say he ultimately decided to accept the nomination because he believed in public service.At least one Democrat on the committee said he thought that Barrís opening statement offers some reassurances, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said Monday that Barr set a ìgood toneî with his prepared remarks before the committee, adding that he ìhelped himself significantlyî by addressing some questions regarding his past criticisms of the Mueller investigation.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee member added, however, that he still has outstanding concerns about Barrís views on presidential power, the use of pardons, and his willingness to submit to advice from the departmentís ethics officials.ìHis last confirmation hearing was 27 years ago <U+2015> we canít pretend that these are similar times. These are very different times and I think its very important he makes his commitment to the rule of law and, in particular, the protection of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller,î Coons said during a conference call with reporters.Additional reporting by Igor Bobic.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Washington Post first reported the invitation, which Watson Colemanís office later confirmed in a news release.ìPresident Trump justified shutting the government down for five weeks by demonizing immigrants as the scourge of the country and the root of our nationís crime and insecurity,î the news release said. ìWe need to implement a true bipartisan immigration reform plan <U+2015> one that both secures our border and establishes a pathway to citizenship for people like Victorina, who are positively contributing to our communities.îToday, I invited Victorina Morales, a constituent, as my guest at the #SOTU, Ms. Morales, an undocumented immigrant, was fired from the Trump National Golf Club, and has since campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. https://t.co/o8bjrSojpl pic.twitter.com/WaVvkOTSZcThe invitation came after reports of the Trump Organization failing to properly check its employeesí work status while the president himself demanded $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall demand led to the government shutdown that recently ended after 35 days.The presidentís son Eric Trump said Tuesday that the organization plans to institute E-Verify, a federal program that allows employers to check employeesí immigration status.Elected officials will sometimes use the opportunity to invite a guest to the State of the Union as a way to make a social or political statement. Trump used his first address in 2017 to invite relatives of people he said were killed by undocumented immigrants. President Barack Obama in 2016 invited a Dreamer, an undocumented immigrant brought to the U.S. as a child,†who served in the military.Morales, who came to the U.S. illegally in 1999, has been vocally campaigning for fair treatment of undocumented immigrants since she lost her job. On Tuesday, she joined three other former club workers on Capitol Hill to push lawmakers for protection and an investigation into the Trump Organizationís hiring practices.ìI hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country <U+2015> women and children fleeing violence, law-abiding, tax-paying people who would do almost anything to be Americans,î Watson Colemanís release said. ìAnd if he canít, Iíve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

For the most part this week, Republicans refused to contradict President Donald Trumpís contortionist explanations for why, technically, sort of, in a roundabout way, Mexico is footing the bill. ìI certainly understand the presidentís logic, and Iíve always got it,î Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost Friday, ìthat if we have more jobs in America, because of an improved [North American Free Trade] Agreement, that itíll be more economic tax base for the United States.îThe new trade agreement negotiated last year has not yet been approved by Congress and does not mention the wall. If that explanation wasnít confusing or tenuous enough, Marshall also said the wall was ìan investment.îìThis is the best $5.7 billion of American taxpayer money that we can use,î he said. ìItíll come back in multiples for decades to come if it keeps out drugs, if it keeps out terrorists, if it keeps out criminals.î†Over the course of more than two dozen conversations this week, Republicans tried their best to evade questions about whoís paying for the wall, though some members acknowledged it was not Mexico. But plenty of GOP lawmakers were happy to accept Trumpís arguments that Mexico would eventually pay, that new trade deals would offset the cost, or that, hey, doesnít a wall pay for itself anyway?ìWe are paying as taxpayers for not having border security,î Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) said. ìI can tell you that. We are already.îRoe added that ìthe wall will pay for itself, absolutely,î but he acknowledged that Mexico wasnít actually footing the bill. ìThe taxpayers are gonna pay for it, but weíre paying for it already,î Roe said. ìWhether we donít protect our border or we do <U+2015> weíre paying the bill.î†That was essentially the argument that Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) offered as well. He said if America built the wall, ìby virtue of the reduced illegal immigration that it will cause, itíll be a great savings.îRepublicans also said that the tax cuts they passed at the end of 2017 would pay for themselves. The theory <U+2015> which most experts considered ridiculous <U+2015> was that lower taxes would boost economic growth, lead to higher corporate profits, and then more tax revenues from those profits. The theory proved wrong: despite solid growth in 2018, corporate tax revenue for the year fell 15 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Of the Republicans who took the presidentís side that Mexico would pay for the wall, the explanation was overwhelmingly that, because of the new trade agreement, Mexico was technically paying for it.†ìThe presidentís point is that, indirectly, we will be receiving more revenue from them as a result of the new fair trade law, and I think heís got a good point there,î Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) said. ìIn an indirect sense, heís right. In a direct sense, no, theyíre not writing us a check,î he conceded.Trump used to say Mexico would make a direct payment of $5 to $10 billion, an idea so absurd that Trump himself begged the president of Mexico in 2017 not to contradict him publicly, saying it was ìthe least important thing that we are talking aboutî anyway. But Trump has shifted to claiming that Mexico would pay indirectly thanks to the new trade deal, which would not be true even if Congress approves the latest version of the deal.The idea that trade pays for the wall is confusing <U+2015> which may be why Republicans have latched on to it. ìThe president says the Mexicans will be paying for the wall through NAFTA,î Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said.HuffPost asked Thune if that made any sense, given that the new agreement doesnít even mention the wall.†ìWell look, however the wall gets paid for, I think everybody agrees that border securityís a pretty important issue, especially now,î Thune said. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) sort of acknowledged that the trade talking point made no sense, but still plowed through it anyway.†ìI think what the presidentís talking about is this is a term of reference that under NAFTA that weíre going to save a lot of money,î Shelby said, adding that even though NAFTA and the wall are entirely separate things, ìItís still all part of the government. Thatís what heís talking about.îRep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) said he was saying it even before Trump was saying it: The trade agreement will indirectly pay for the wall.How?ìBecause we got a better deal,î Gibbs answered, going on to explain that stopping ìa bunch of illegalsî from coming to America would also pay for the wall. ìThatís probably a bigger savings,î he said.†The only way the new trade deal could pay for the wall, according to Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, would be if it added a 20 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico. It doesnít.†Many Republicans offered agnostic arguments about whether Mexico would pay for the wall.Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) repeatedly said he has ìno idea.î Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) said we would have to ìwait and seeî on that. And Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said heís ìstruggled with the mechanics of ëHey, itís going to be because of incongruous trade, itís going to be because of this and that.íîìItíll be fascinating to see how that math actually works,î he said.Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said the president has his arguments on Mexico funding wall construction, and he would leave those to him. Asked if he bought those arguments, Thornberry said it wasnít for him to ìbuy or sell the argument.îìI focus on the things that I think are important for national security, and I will continue to do that,î he said. And when we commented that he was looking at us like weíre crazy for even asking the question, Thornberry agreed. ìYou are crazy,î he said.Many other Republicans ducked the question entirely. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) remained completely silent and kept walking while we trailed behind him asking about Mexico paying for the wall, as well as his thoughts on Trump declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress to build his barrier.Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) said he wasnít ìgoing to comment on that at the moment,î though, with some prodding, he said, ìfrom an accounting standard, not directly, but indirectly, thereís a lot of transactions between our two countries.îRep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.) repeatedly said his concern was border security, not who was paying for a wall. ìYou can ask me that question as many times as you want,î Mitchell said. ìYouíre not going to trap me into a conversation about whether Mexico is paying because itís not my problem, nor my concern.îAnd Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) was a wall of talking points.ìNo one wins in a shutdown, no one wins if the borderís not secure,î he said, repeating the phrase like a mantra in response to further questions, before going silent.There were some Republicans who broke with Trump. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), and Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) all said itís been clear that Mexico is not paying for the construction of a 2,000-mile barrier.Asked what he thought of arguments like the trade deal paying for the wall, or that the wall would somehow pay for itself, Amash said those rationales were ìsilly.î ìThatís not money going to the wall from Mexico. It doesnít go to the Treasury that way and then go to the wall,î he said.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also told HuffPost this week that he ìnever thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall.îBut those were the exceptions. By and large, Republicans were willing to accept Trumpís trade deal argument, even though if it were true, there would be no need to shut down the government to try to force Democrats to support a $5 billion in wall appropriation funding.This week, some 800,000 federal employees are missing their first paychecks since funding lapsed in December. And if the shutdown continues for several more weeks, it will imperil housing vouchers and food assistance for millions. If you expected Republicans to break with Trump over the shutdown anytime soon <U+2015> like perhaps Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) choosing to hold a vote on a clean funding bill and then Republicans in both chambers voting to override the presidentís veto <U+2015> just remember those GOP members who refuse to break with Trump in favor of reality.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), a lawmaker known for his mild temperament, launched into an impassioned speech on the chamber floor Thursday, lambasting fellow Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for his role in the ongoing partial government shutdown.ìI seldom, as you know, rise on this floor to contradict somebody on the other side,î Bennet said shortly after Cruz spoke. ìBut these crocodile tears that the senator from Texas is crying for first responders are too hard for me to take.î.@SenatorBennet responds to @Sentedcruz: ""These crocodile tears that the Senator from Texas is crying for first responders are too hard for me to take."" pic.twitter.com/g4FBxdfiGYThe episode reflects heightened tensions between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who failed to advance two separate bills to reopen the government on Thursday. About 800,000 federal workers are expected to miss their second paychecks of the year on Friday due to the impasse, which has centered on President Donald Trumpís refusal to sign spending bills that donít include $5.7 billion to begin work on a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.During Bennetís speech, which lasted nearly 25 minutes, he quickly grew fired up. He attacked Cruzís role in another government shutdown in 2013 when the Texas Republican led a failed effort to block the Affordable Care Act. The government closed for 16 days while Colorado was still recovering from rampant flooding. The Washington Post noted that the event caused federal emergency funds to be held up.ìWhen the senator from Texas shut this government down, my state was flooded,î Bennet, shouting at times, said. ìIt was underwater. People were killed. Peopleís houses were destroyed. Their small businesses were ruined forever. And because of the senator from Texas, this government was shut down.îCruz fired back after the speech, slamming Bennet for ìattacking me personallyî and saying heíd never ìbellowed or yelled at a colleague on the Senate floor.îìI hope I never do that,î Cruz added.Bennet also lobbed a shot at Trump, saying it was ìludicrous ... that this government is shut down over a promise the president of the United States couldnít keep and that America is not interested in having him keep.ìThis idea that he was going to build a medieval wall across the southern border of Texas, take [land] from the farmers and ranchers that were there, and have the Mexicans pay for it isnít true.

Pelosi delayed Trumpís address amid a partial government shutdown, during which 800,000 federal workers went without pay for 35 days as Trump demanded funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.Read Trumpís State of the Union remarks as prepared for delivery below:Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nationís infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts Americaís interests first.There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of Americaís mission, and the power of American pride.In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade <U+2015> the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution <U+2015> and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of Americaís future. The decision is ours to make.We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom <U+2015> a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs <U+2015> something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history ñ- 157 million.We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty <U+2015> and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.We have unleashed a revolution in American energy <U+2015> the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone <U+2015> almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States <U+2015> and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesnít work that way!We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate ñ some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population <U+2015> and far beyond.Aliceís story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing <U+2015> and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.In June, I commuted Aliceís sentence <U+2015> and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.When I saw Aliceís beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.Inspired by stories like Aliceís, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.No issue better illustrates the divide between Americaís working class and Americaís political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration <U+2015> reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate <U+2015> it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities <U+2015> including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border theyíre going to keep streaming back in.Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.Iíve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families ñ no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debraís parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharonís granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter, Madison.To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: ìIf I can make sure these young girls get their justice, Iíve done my job.î Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.Special Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement <U+2015> and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.My Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall <U+2015> but the proper wall never got built. Iíll get it built.This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier <U+2015> not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime <U+2015> one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nationís most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So letís work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.As we work to defend our peopleís safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.No one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before <U+2015> and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount <U+2015> reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods <U+2015> and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I donít blame China for taking advantage of us <U+2015> I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried <U+2015> until now.Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement <U+2015> or USMCA <U+2015> will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of Americaís crumbling infrastructure.I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill <U+2015> and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs <U+2015> and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.Already, as a result of my Administrationís efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.But we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.I am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Childrenís Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ìLast Day of Chemo.î Grace <U+2015> you are an inspiration to us all.Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for Americaís children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave <U+2015> so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the motherís womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the motherís womb.Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children <U+2015> born and unborn <U+2015> are made in the holy image of God.The final part of my agenda is to protect Americaís National Security.Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military <U+2015> with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO <U+2015> but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing Americaís interests.For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we canít ñ- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom <U+2015> and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence ñ- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.Our approach is based on principled realism <U+2015> not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel <U+2015> and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor <U+2015> and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement <U+2015> but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nationís power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole <U+2015> and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.My Administration has acted decisively to confront the worldís leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery <U+2015> but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall <U+2015> more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judahís 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judahís family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: ìItís the Americans.îA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. ìTo me,î Joshua recalls, ìthe American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.îI began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Hermanís story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight <U+2015> seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.Why did they do it? They did it for America <U+2015> they did it for us.Everything that has come since <U+2015> our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice <U+2015> all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.Think of this Capitol <U+2015> think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.We must choose whether we are defined by our differences <U+2015> or whether we dare to transcend them.We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance <U+2015> or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.This is our future <U+2015> our fate <U+2015> and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in Americaís destiny <U+2015> that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

She didnít need to name the president directly when she urged Americans to hold people ìin the very highest officesî accountable for racism. But she did call Trump out directly for shutting down the government last month, making federal workers go without pay for weeks in his push for border wall money.ìMaking their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace,î said Abrams. ìThe shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values.îStill, Abrams extended an olive branch to Trump, urging him to consider how much Democrats and Republicans can accomplish by working together.ìEven as I am very disappointed by the presidentís approach to our problems, I still donít want him to fail,î she said. ìBut we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America.îFor all the potential of America, Abrams said, nothing is possible without ìthe bedrock guaranteeî of peopleís right to vote.ìLetís be clear: Voter suppression is real,î she said. ìFrom making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy.îThe issue is personal for her. Abrams lost her governorís race in November to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) amid allegations of voter suppression. Kemp refused to recuse himself as the stateís top election official in his own election, which many said was a conflict of interest. He also faced scrutiny after his office placed 53,000 votersí registrations in suspense because their names didnít exactly match a state record. Nearly 70 percent of the people on the list were black.Abrams included a call to fight for voting rights in Tuesday nightís response and took a shot at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recently called a group of proposed voting reforms in Democratic legislation a ìpower grab.îìWe must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a ëpower grab,íî she said. ìThe foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders <U+2015> not where politicians pick their voters.îUltimately,†Abrams said, the American promise stems from basic family values like the ones she grew up with as her family fluctuated between being lower middle class and working poor. She talked about her parents coming home from work ìweary and bone-tiredî but still showing her and her siblings all that they could be.ìOur power and strength as Americans lives in our hard work and our belief in more,î Abrams said. ìMy family understood firsthand that, while success is not guaranteed, we live in a nation where opportunity is possible.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

And in Texas and in Arizona, they donít,î host Chuck Todd said.ìAnd a lot of this, we donít want to talk about,î Brokaw said. ìBut the fact is, on the Republican side, a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary, important, new constituent in American politics, Hispanics, who will come here and all be Democrats. Also, I hear, when I push people a little harder, ëWell, I donít know whether I want brown grandbabies.í I mean, thatís also a part of it.îBrokaw: ""The Hispanics should be working harder on assimilation."" pic.twitter.com/D4QGQhSRZhìItís the intermarriage that is going on and the cultures that are conflicting with each other,î Brokaw went on. ìI also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder at assimilation. Thatís one of the things Iíve been saying for a long time. You know, they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities. And thatís going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.îLater in the broadcast, ìPBS NewsHourî White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor addressed Brokawís remarks.ìI would just say that we also need to adjust what we think of as America,î Alcindor said. ìYouíre talking about assimilation. I grew up in Miami, where people speak Spanish, but their kids speak English. And the idea that we think Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages wasnít always part of America, is, in some ways, troubling.îThank you, @Yamiche, for speaking up.This tweet was written by an ìassimilatedî Latina who speaks English. pic.twitter.com/p2kpnaXOTONo one on the panel asked Brokaw to clarify who has told him they didnít want ìbrown grandbabies.îMany Twitter users declared Brokawís remarks xenophobic.†Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) called Brokaw ìstunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community.î.@tombrokaw, for a celebrated @NBCNews journalist who spent years chronicling American society you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country. Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary @MeetThePress https://t.co/nKoLhjWdbkìUnfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary,î Castro wrote on Twitter.Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, who has written at length about his experience as an undocumented immigrant in America, also hit back at Brokaw, arguing that the countryís diversity is part of its strength.Dear @tombrokaw:Define ""assimilation."" I'm sure you know that the United States of America does not have an official language. The USA speaks in many tonguesññthen as now. That linguistic diversity is part of our strength, especially in a globalized economy. https://t.co/qnrOafoFKiBrokaw addressed his comments Sunday evening via Twitter.ìI feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture,î he wrote. ìFrom my days reporting on cesar chavez to documenting the many contributions of hispanics in all parts of our culture [...] iíve worked hard to knock down false stereo types. in my final comment in Meet i said ALL sides hv to work harder [...] at finding common ground - which i strongly believe. dialogue not division.""i feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics  offended some members of that proud culturefrom my days reporting on cesar chavez to documenting the many contributions of hispanics in all parts of our cultureiíve worked hard to knock down false stereo types. in my final comment in Meet i said ALL sides hv to work harderat finding common ground - which i strongly believe dialogue not divisionmy twitter acct failed me at the worst time.i am sorry, truly sorry, my comments were offensive tomany. the great enduring american tradition of diversity is to be celebrated and cherished. yamiche, thank u for your comments.letís go forward together.A spokesperson for NBC News responded Monday to Brokawís remarks, calling them ìinaccurate and inappropriate.î†NBC statement on Brokaw: ìTomís comments were inaccurate and inappropriate and we are glad he apologized.î No mention of any action beyond that.This article has been updated with NBCís statement."

But those surveyed said theyíre not entirely optimistic the government will avoid further gridlock: 72 percent said itís at least somewhat likely that there will be another government shutdown within a month, Respondents gave negative ratings to everyone in Washington for the shutdown, with disapproval of Congressí performance 41 percentage points higher than approval. The public also gave negative net ratings to congressional Republicans (ñ25), Trump (ñ19) and, by a lesser margin, Democrats in Congress (ñ8) and their own representatives (ñ5).More than 80 percent of Hillary Clinton voters said they approved of Democratsí handling of the shutdown <U+2015> a change from the shutdown a year ago, when barely more than half said the same. Nearly two-thirds said Democrats compromised about the right amount in resolving the shutdown.†Forty percent of Trump voters said the president compromised too much, while another 40 percent said that he compromised about the right amount and 9 percent that he compromised too little. The rest said they were unsure.But that doesnít appear to have significantly dampened their view of the presidentís performance. Eighty-four percent of Trump voters approved of his handling of the shutdown, with 70 percent strongly approving. Remarkably, his approval numbers are close to identical among those who said he compromised too much and those who said he compromised the right amount.Seventy percent of Trump voters said they expect the president to succeed in eventually funding a border wall, with an additional 9 percent saying he has already done so. Eighty-three percent said they want him to keep working to do so, with only 12 percent saying that he should move on to other issues.Few other post-shutdown polls have yet been released. But in a Monmouth University survey†published Monday,†32 percent of Americans surveyed said that the resolution to the shutdown made Trump look weaker, 24 percent that it made him look stronger and 41 percent that it had no effect.ìDespite what was objectively a climbdown in Trumpís position, these poll results provide more evidence that public opinion of the president has been largely baked in since day one,î†Patrick Murray, Monmouthís polling director, said in a statement. ìThe needle may move, but it does not move all that much.îUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: †The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 25 to 27 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGovís opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

An NBC reporter said flights are still taking off and landing but that ìthe rate of them has slowed.îAirlines are telling me the FAA has not halted ALL flights into LGA. Planes are landing and taking off. The rate of them has slowedThe FAAís flight delay site reports arriving flights to LaGuardia are being delayed by an average of one and a half hours.President Donald Trump reportedly has been briefed on the situation.NEW from @PressSec on air traffic control issues: ìThe President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA.îDespite frantic online alerts about the groundings, the scene was quiet and orderly at LaGuardia late Friday morning, and there were nearly as many reporters arriving to cover the expected commotion as there were frustrated travelers still outside the security checkpoint. One uniformed airport employee, who declined to give his name, said most of the passengers impacted by the groundings were already through security.Still, some travelers were frustrated due to flight delays and other complications to their travel plans.†Lana Tanca and three relatives, all from Miami, sat near the baggage claim in Terminal B of the airport. They texted another family member who said her flight from Jacksonville, Florida, was stalled in Washington, D.C.†ìShe said they had to divert it, then they deplaned, then they put her back on the flight,î Tanca said. ìNow theyíre apparently going to divert her again.îElected officials and union leaders have argued that the ongoing government shutdown puts flight passengers at risk. Many air traffic controllers and other staff members arenít being paid, leading some to resign.Itís not yet clear whether the increase in sick leave has anything to do with a worker strike, but unions representing all aviation workers on Wednesday†called for action amid the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.ìIt is unprecedented,î said the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. ìThis is already the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States and there is no end in sight. In our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break.îThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association released a statement Friday in which it hinted that the sick days and staffing issues may be tied to a broader coordinated attempt to strike <U+2015> without actually using the word ìstrike.î The statement read, in part:NATCA does not condone or endorse any federal employees participating in or endorsing a coordinated activity that negatively effects the capacity of the National Airspace System or other activities that undermine the professional image and reputation of the men and women we represent.Air traffic controllers take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public at all costs very seriously. Nothing else matters except safety.With that said, in the past few weeks, we have warned about what could happen as a result of the prolonged shutdown. Many controllers have reached the breaking point of exhaustion, stress, and worry caused by this shutdown. Each hour that goes by that the shutdown continues makes the situation worse.Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, told New York magazine on Friday that flight attendants could also walk out to show solidarity with government employees affected by the shutdown.ìWeíre mobilizing immediately,î she said.Separately, in a press release, she called for the shutdown to ìend immediately.îìDo we have your attention now, [Senate Majority] Leader [Mitch] McConnell? All lawmakers?î she said. ìOpen the government and then get back to the business of democracy to discuss whatever issue you so choose. This shutdown must end immediately. Our countryís entire economy is on the line.îThe controllers union warned Wednesday that a shortage of controllers, who have been working without pay for more than a month, was creating risks to the air-travel system.ìStaffing in our air traffic control facilities is already at a 30-year low and controllers are only able to maintain the systemís efficiency and capacity by working overtime, including 10-hour days and 6-day workweeks at many of our nationís busiest facilities,î it said.†Luke Drake, a regional vice president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said his people are also feeling the stresses add up, and that he isnít surprised at the increased number of sick air traffic controller workers.ìI assume it has primarily to do with the stress with not only the nature of their work but having to do all of that while not being paid,î Drake said of workers calling out. ìIím not surprised given weíre now at our second lost pay period that the stresses are increasing.îDrake said it hasnít helped that administration officials in the White House <U+2015> including Trump <U+2015> have downplayed workers not being paid.ìOne of the really infuriating comments Iíve seen is the expectation that our people should have reserve accounts for the government being shut down as if thatís a normal thing now,î he said. ìSomehow because weíre federal employees weíre supposed to have money set aside to deal with political calamities, and thatís just unconscionable to me.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Except that Hillís new job was congresswoman for Californiaís 25th District, and when she was hugging her mom, she was surrounded by TV cameras arranged to document her swearing-in ceremony.Sometimes in the middle of an unreal day, you just really need to hug your mom. Weíre about to be sworn in. Letís do this. pic.twitter.com/8zmyMbgvb9Hill is my age. In fact, we were born just three weeks apart, both late summer babies. We grew up thousands of miles apart, but in many ways, I see myself in her. We both make jokes about our respective ìresting bitch facesî and take photos in snowstorms. I know this because she posts those photos on Instagram.Hill is, unquestionably, my peer. So is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (29, D-N.Y.), Max Rose (31, D-N.Y.), Haley Stevens (35, D-Mich.), Lauren Underwood (32, D-Ill.), Abby Finkenauer (30, D-Iowa), Ilhan Omar (37, D-Minn.) ... and 14 other freshman members of Congress, comprising one of the most diverse classes in United States history. At the start of the 115th Congress in January 2017, there were just five millennials (individuals born between 1981 and 1996) in the House of Representatives. But as of January 2018, when the 116th Congress convened, there are 26. According to Pew, more than one-fifth of the 91 congressional freshmen are millennials, and two-thirds (14) of those representatives are Democrats. For the first time, the millennial generation <U+2015> my generation <U+2015> is represented in Congress in numbers that really matter. And for the first time, the millennial generation can see those numbers in action. We can watch Stevens enter her office for the first time. We can witness Omar beam with pride as she gets sworn in with her hand on the Quran. We can follow along as Ocasio-Cortez and Hill and Underwood try to track down Mitch McConnell to confront him about the government shutdown. (#WheresMitch.) ††Because here to combat Donald Trumpís clapback presidency, defined by one-sided exultations and blocked accounts on Twitter, is a cohort of freshmen congresspeople who are naturally inclined to view social media as a public forum.800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and weíre pushing to get them paid ASAP.Weíre here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why canít we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs? #WheresMitch pic.twitter.com/FogCPg6ayZPredictably, there has been a swift backlash to these (diverse, mostly female) newly minted, digital native politicians. The negative reaction has been especially vicious toward Ocasio-Cortez, who, as a progressive young woman of color, would have stood out in Congress even without her dynamic social media presence, but seems to be perceived as a threat to both the establishment of her own party and sexist obsessives outside of it. ìShe needs to decide: Does she want to be an effective legislator or just continue being a Twitter star?î one House Democrat told Politico last week, suggesting that those two things must be mutually exclusive, as though a fiery Twitter presence must be indicative of a purely self-serving desire for fame rather than a genuine desire to communicate with the public. This is a perception that Stevens takes issue with. ìI think we should be celebrating the way that this freshman class is using social media to bring a new level of transparency and access to our government,î she told me. ìThatís a great thing!î†* * *The arrival of these social media-savvy millennial congresspeople is thrilling to watch on another level; an indication that people my age are growing up to become the power brokers and thought leaders that a wider culture told us we were too lazy and entitled to be. ìI have always been fascinated by politics, but up until this election, it felt like something the ëgrown-upsí handled,î Kate Ormonde, 34, told me, explaining how the photographs that came out of swearing-in day affected her. ì[There were] so many women of different backgrounds, dressed in bright colors, contrasted with white men in dark suits.îAt 22 percent of the population, millennials are poised to become the largest living generation, currently ranging in age from 23 to 38, a prime time to be entering into the ranks of power inside and outside government.Weíre also an endlessly <U+2015> and arguably, unfairly <U+2015> mocked generation. Weíve allegedly ìkilledî everything, from Applebeeís to beer to home ownership to diamonds. Weíre too sensitive, too self-absorbed and too focused on buying avocado toast to save up for a home or focus on building stable careers. Look a bit closer, and weíre the first generation that is predicted to be financially worse off than our parents. Weíre saddled with student debt. Weíre perennially burned out even as we try harder and harder to optimize our lives. Itís becoming infinitely harder to prepare for retirement.Many of the millennials I spoke to for this piece mentioned these lived experiences as a reason they were so thrilled to see a critical mass of their peers so visibly in government. ìThey understand that younger people have to work harder than their parents to achieve the same quality of life,î said Aaron Huertas, 34. ìThey grew up with the climate crisis as textbook science. Theyíve adopted more democratic forms of communication and seem friendlier to grassroots politics.î ìItís amazing to see people have our ideals in mind, advocating for issues that impact us,î added Eva Rubinoff, 31, citing student loans and social security as things sheíd hope to see prioritized. †Of course, these freshman congresspeople are still determining which issues to tweet about, what photos and videos to share and what stories to promote. No social media account is going to be truly unfiltered, and as a public forum, social media certainly has its clear faults. But by breaking down some of the traditional barriers that have long existed between elected leaders and their constituents, these representatives are projecting a different sense of accessibility <U+2015> one that works in these newly elected officialsí favor. Not only are younger voters relating to them, but constituents are more able to view social media as a place of discussion rather than one-sided doomsday announcements and opaque decision-making. The expectations that the public has for its elected officials <U+2015> both online and off <U+2015> is shifting.Stevens told HuffPost that she often uses Facebook and Twitter to direct-message with constituents, including those who vehemently disagree with her. Sometimes, she says, she even takes those conversations offline by asking for her constituentís phone number so they can talk about the issue in a more personal way.†She sees her Instagram as more of an open window; by posting informal photos and videos of her day, she hopes people can get a daily glimpse of what sheís up to behind the closed doors of Capitol Hill.This is a sentiment that Hill echoed to CNN. ìI donít want to become more formal. Thatís not on the table,î she said.Perhaps no congressional newbie better encapsulates the shift in public discourse than Ocasio-Cortez. She has posted Instagram stories of her office, her voting card, her press-on manicure, postcards from her constituents and her dance moves. Last week, she posted a photo of herself on the couch, under a fuzzy blanket with a pint of Ben & Jerryís ice cream. ìSpoiler alert: Congress is like any other job where you have your long and tiring days and just want to eat ice cream at the end of it,î she wrote. What a gift to see the job of a congressperson as just that <U+2015> a job, not something that is separate from most of us, not entailing decisions made in an ivory tower by wealthy white elders. Itís too early to tell what the legacy of these young politicians might be, but damn if it doesnít feel good to watch your peers take charge of the messy country weíve collectively inherited.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified the state that Rep. Lauren Underwood represents. The piece has been updated to reflect that she represents Illinois.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

And after three-plus weeks of government shutdown, it should be clear by now <U+2015> if it wasnít already<U+2015> that President Donald Trump is uniquely terrible at the practice. Trump is so out of the ordinary when it comes to negotiation, in fact, that the quarterly published by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, devoted its latest issue to him. For the first time in the Negotiation Journalís 35-year history, itís used a whole issue to talk about a U.S. president.Due out next week, the Journal drills into the central paradox of Trump and negotiation: The president spent his career positioning himself as the consummate deal-maker. Heís listed as the author, after all, of the ìArt of the Deal,î though it was ghost-written. Yet, thereís little evidence heís actually good at deal-making. Many of his best real-estate deals were actually put in place by George Ross (who handled real estate negotiations), and Roy Cohn, the legendary attorney, was Trumpís original fixer and known for being a brutal negotiator, writes University of Pennsylvania Wharton School professor G. Richard Shell in a piece for the issue.†Without Cohn, who died in 1986, there have been mostly business failures and bankruptcies and lawsuits.††ìIn the close to 15 years that Iíve been editing the Journal, nobody has used Donald Trumpís the Art of the Deal as a citation in their article. Never. Not once,î said Nancy Waters, the managing editor of the Journal, which is the publication for the Program on Negotiation, a consortium that includes Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University.The omission was not out of elitism. Waters said that the publication, which has contributors across disciplines from around the globe, has covered other more pop-culture-esque business books. Trumpís just never turned up.That may be because Trumpís negotiating style at a base level contradicts all the best practices generally agreed on by experts in negotiation.ìThe way he negotiates directly challenges what is almost a half-century of tools and principles and methods that have emerged in the field,î said Joel Cutcher-Gershenfeld, a professor in the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, who is the editor of the Journal. To start, Trump claims to use a zero-sum strategy in which he wins and the other side loses.†The win-lose equation is considered out of date, ineffective and generally counterproductive among those who study negotiation.†Win-lose dealmaking is a tough sell in a democracy or anytime youíre trying to reach an agreement with a powerful counterparty who has enough leverage to withstand the demands of the bully across the table, like Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fresh off her partyís electoral victory in the 2018 elections. In such cases, youíre not likely going to get exactly what you want. So a good negotiator has to think empathetically about what the other side wants and then sell them a deal that could be viewed as a so-called ìwin-win.î Trump isnít known for empathy.Still, this isnít complicated. ìAll the other presidents knew how to make deals,î said Carrie Menkel-Meadow, a professor of Law at the University of California Irvine Law School and a co-editor on the special issue.ìTrump doesnít understand the basic principle: To get what you want, you have to give other people what they want,î said Menkel-Meadow, who was at Georgetown Law during the Clinton-era shutdown and trained negotiators at the Department of Justice.A solid deal-maker also doesnít make an enemy out of his counterparty. Ideally in politics or diplomacy, heís built up some goodwill with them. Trump, on the other hand, demonizes and belittles his political opponents (and sometimes his allies).Nancy and Cryiní Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!Former President Barack Obama used to get criticized for not schmoozing with Republicans in the House. This president, on the other hand, not only isnít here to make friends, heís actively terrorizing his colleagues via Twitter.ìWhat weíre seeing here is the cost of not building a relationship with the Democrats and their leaders, and now when itís absolutely essential because theyíre more powerful and he needs their votes, heís incapable of doing it,î said Thomas Kochan, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyís Sloan School of Management, who wrote about Trumpís effect on business negotiations. ìThey donít trust him; he doesnít trust them.îLack of trust is the third critical piece of the failed Trump strategy. Negotiation experts concede that a hard-driving win-lose strategy sometimes can work. But not without trust.Former President Lyndon Johnson, for example, was known for his hard-driving, persistent, negotiation tactics. And, of course, Johnson was able to push through†civil rights legislation at a time when his own party was dominated by segregationists. This was a case of someone staking out a position and forcing everyone to his side.But one of the key ways Johnson differed from Trump, Cutcher-Gershenfeld pointed out, is trust. ìHis word was his bond,î he said.Trump has already famously backed out of immigration deals heís agreed to.There may be some upside to Trumpís willingness to break the established norms of negotiating, said Cutcher-Gershenfeld.†ìI donít want to say itís all bad, but I do want to say when you break the rules of the game you should know what youíre doing.î He pointed that in the case of Trump opening talks with North Korea, there could possibly be some upside to the presidentís unconventional approach.The zero-sum strategy and willingness to walk away from the deal may also have been better suited to one-off real-estate transactions. Politics is different. ìIn negotiations with Congress, when you walk away there isnít another Congress to walk to,î he said.Right now, Democrats seem to be just as locked into their position as Trump. On Tuesday, a group from the House declined the presidentís offer for a lunch meeting, though there were reports that behind-the-scenes talks were happening.In the Negotiation Journalís special issue, 35 experts in negotiation from across a wide range of disciplines <U+2015> lawyers, trade negotiators, psychologists, business school professors, political scientists <U+2015> examine the effect Trumpís deal-making strategy is having on the world, from international diplomacy to gender and race relations here in the U.S. Many of the authors have advised both Democratic and Republican policymakers over the years.The study of conflict resolution really took off during the Cold War when the stakes of failed negotiation and zero-sum gamesmanship were truly apocalyptic: nuclear annihilation. The stakes today seem increasingly high, as well, with Brexit threatening to destabilize the U.K. and Trumpís sketchy diplomacy skills threatening to upend so much else. Still, many of the experts in the field are true believers in the proposition that there is no dispute too thorny to untangle. Many still believe thereís a path to peace in the Middle East if only the right strategy is employed. And so, several who spoke with HuffPost did see a way out of the shutdown that didnít involve the courts. (Thatís where you go when negotiations break down, said Menkel-Meadow.)MITís Kochan suggested ìreframingî the debate. Instead of making this a fight about a wall, making it a negotiation more broadly about border security. That way thereís more to bargain over <U+2015> not just a wall yes or no, but also funds for greater resources. Democrats could argue for support for the Dreamers and a path to citizenship. He and other experts also recommended bringing in more people to negotiate <U+2015> a tried-and-true tactic. Kochan suggested that the president, the Senate and the House should create an expert panel that would figure out a path forward. †Since this is Trump weíre talking about perhaps the key to unlocking the stalemate begins and ends with the presidentís perception of himself. ìAny solution has to feed his ego,î Kochan said. ìAs much as itís painful to play into that.îRight now, heís backed himself into a corner and if his opponents truly want to break this impasse they have to help him figure out a way to save face, said Deborah Kolb, a professor emeritus at the Simmons University School of Business in Boston and the author of Negotiating at Work: Turn Small Wins into Big Gains.ìHeís really locked himself in,î she said, adding: Great negotiators just donít do that.Clarification:†Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was George Ross who negotiated many of Trumpís real estate deals.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported about 95,000 people from the interior of the United States last year. Interior deportations in Obamaís first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did Obama register numbers lower than Trumpís. Trumpís comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administrationís†chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the Trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals. Trumpís fixation on the wall <U+2015> or fence, or steel slats, or ìpeaches,î or whatever heís calling it this week <U+2015> is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement. †The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.†Thatís exactly whatís happening. The countryís immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to The New York Times <U+2015> which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse project at Syracuse University <U+2015> with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on. ICE is about to blow through its detention budget†again,†raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to BuzzFeed. These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the White House. But itís a perfectly logical outcome for Trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows. †Trumpís other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with Obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which Trumpís first acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because itís a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge. Likewise, the Trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of Central American families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum <U+2015> effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didnít share then-Attorney General Jeff Sessionsí enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too. On top of all this, the Trump administrationís hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made Democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace ìsanctuaryî policies limiting cooperation with ICE than they were under Obama. The consequence of Trumpís lack of diplomacy is that ICE now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agencyís efficiency. So,†now the president who entered office promising to deport†up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the Democrat who preceded him <U+2015> even though ICEís budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And Trumpís fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient. None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for Trumpís Republican backers in Congress to defend the presidentís intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined ìborder security.î But thereís no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of Central American families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from Trumpís record so far, heís more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement. Some of this turns out to be good news for Trumpís critics. When Trump took over the White House, he inherited an enforcement system capable of expelling a quarter-million migrants from the interior annually. But if the shutdown debacle offers any insight into his thinking, it would appear Trump does not care. Heíd rather have a wall. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

But instead they commandeer our conversation,î said Anand Giridharadas, author of Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,†who will not be attending.The U.S. government is in its longest shutdown on record. Britain is spiraling out of control over Brexit. Flames of rage engulf France. But ìthe plutocrats who shattered the world order are gathering to make out in the mountains,î Giridharadas said.According to a†report from the anti-poverty coalition Oxfam,†timed to coincide with Davos, the worldís 2,200 billionaires grew 12 percent wealthier last year. But the wealth is not trickling down. The poorest half of the world got 11 percent poorer in 2018, and today the top 26 billionaires own the same wealth as the poorest 3.8 billion people.ìThe economy we have today is fundamentally inhuman,î Paul OíBrien, Oxfam Americaís vice president for policy and campaigns,†told HuffPost. ìYouíre not going to get a decrease in extreme wealth until you have leadership committed to tackling its root causes, and right now we donít.î†In the U.S., wages have been essentially stagnant for decades while members of the Davos elite have gotten significantly richer. The fortunes of a dozen 2009 Davos attendees have jumped by a combined $175 billion in the years since, a Bloomberg analysis†found.Among those on the list were Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who has tripled his net worth since 2009, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose wealth grew 1,853 percent in that period.Zuckerberg is not scheduled to attend Davos, but Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is using the gathering as a stop on a Facebook†ìapology tour,î†after a slew of bad publicity over its role in the spread of misinformation in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and evidence that the company helped†stir violence†in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.The problem with Davos is that it provides ìa moral glow of heroism to people who should be begging for societyís mercy for their role in breaking our social contract,î said Giridharadas. ìNo one at Facebook should be on a panel explaining anything. They should be apologizing Ö for breaking our democracy and for enabling ethnic violence.îTo Giridharadas, Davos amounts to a week of ìrich-splaining,î characterized by terms that shift the conversation away from actual social change: ìWin-winî replaces a debate about social justice. ìLean inî gets in the way of maternity leave. Talk of ìmicro-creditsî takes the place of a discussion about a wealth tax. ìThese elites have essentially used the rhetoric of changing the world to prevent change,î he said.Seemingly taking note of populist protests that most recently have hit France, Klaus Schwab, WEFís executive chairman,†told reporters†before the yearly meeting that globalization has to become more inclusive. ìGlobalization produces winners and losers, and there are many more winners in the last 24, 25, 30 years,î he said. ìBut now we have to look after the losers, after those who have been left behind.îBut in Davos, itís business as usual: Schmooze and be schmoozed.†On the main street, the Russian and Saudi governments have set up shops, advertising that theyíre open for business. After pressure from the Kremlin, WEF†reportedly reversed†its decision not to invite three high-profile Russian tycoons facing U.S. sanctions, including billionaire Oleg Deripaska, known in Davos for his†rowdy parties†and in the U.S. for his business dealings with Paul Manafort, the now-jailed former Donald Trump campaign manager. Those dealings are now†reportedly part of special counsel Robert Muellerís investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The budget for the World Economic Forum has†more than doubled since 2009, to $337 million last year. What WEF sells at this ski resort, of course, is access, and itís a bit of an inside-Davos joke that the stream of exclusive parties and private events provoke FOMO among even the most high-powered attendees.†This year, however, the joke may have lost its punch line. The action is clearly somewhere else. President Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron are all staying home to deal with fractured politics and public anger.Giridharadas believes the moment has come.ìDavos has to end,î he said.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He previously forced a 35-day partial government shutdown over the issue. He had claimed he would not let it end until he got the money, but wound up caving after 800,000 federal workers ó including his own Secret Service detail ó began their second month without a paycheck.Now, many Trump allies say he has no choice if Congress again refuses to give him what he wants in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill currently under negotiation by a House-Senate conference committee.One former White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would lose a significant percentage of his supporters if he did not deliver on the wall, a campaign promise he first made on the day he announced his presidency.ìItís the only way he gets it done,î said another Republican adviser close to Trump, also on condition of anonymity, adding that the politics make sense for Trump even if the money is taken from hurricane reconstruction projects in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.The adviser added that the Republican governors of Texas and Florida would back Trump. ìAnd screw Puerto Rico,î the adviser said. ìPuerto Rico doesnít have electoral votes last time I checked.îWhat Trump wants and what Trump can get away with, though, may be two different things.While Trump has the authority to declare a ìnational emergency,î the same law that allows him to do so also lets Congress end that emergency by passing a bill ó a bill that, unlike most in the Senate, cannot be blocked by the majority leader from coming to the floor and which needs 51 votes, rather than the usual 60, to pass.One of those 51 is likely to be Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker. ìI would be inclined to vote for the resolution of disapproval,î he said of the possible emergency declaration. ìI think itís bad law and I think itís bad strategy for the president.î†Trump and his White House, of course, argue that the situation at the southern border is a national security crisis and clearly constitutes an ìemergencyî that a president has the power to act on unilaterally. Yet that argument may be undone by Trumpís own words and actions about the necessity for the wall, which have waxed and waned with the politics of the moment.Migrant caravans, for example, have existed for years, as refugees escaping violence in their home countries and those seeking a better life band together traveling north across Central America and Mexico. But Trump only started warning about them as a threat to U.S. citizens in April 2018, with midterm elections on the horizon, claiming that they were filled with ìgang membersî and ìvery bad people.îWhen the November election passed, so did Trumpís interest in the caravans. The daily drumbeat disappeared. Trump did not bring up ìcaravansî until 10 days after the election, as a December deadline for a government spending bill started drawing near.Trump critics also point to his tendency to play up violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants, even though illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Trump invited the family of an elderly Nevada couple allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant to his State of the Union speech this week to build his case for a border wall. But he has ignored last monthís shooting of four Houston police officers by a pair of white, middle-aged drug dealers as well as the execution-style killings of five women at a Florida bank a week earlier. A 21-year-old Indiana native ó also white ó has been charged in those slayings.ìHe continues to activate fear in the public with things that he knows will scare them. Thatís his MO. Itís not new,î said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. ìUnfortunately, it works, among some people. But itís really cynical politics.îCynical or not, Trump appears to be holding with that strategy in the days remaining before a quarter of the government again runs out of spending authority on Feb. 15.Trump is planning a re-election campaign rally on Feb. 11 in El Paso, Texas, a city Trump has repeatedly ó and falsely ó claimed had a high crime rate until a fence was constructed along its border with Mexico.ìThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime <U+2015> one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nationís most dangerous cities,î Trump said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. ìNow, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country.†Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.îThat brought a rebuke from the cityís mayor the next day. ìWe are considered the safest city with a population greater than 500,000,î Dee Margo, a Republican, told MSNBC. ìI talked to our police chief, through his staff, today, and found out in 2008, we were like second. In 2009, after the fence was built, we were still second. But weíve progressed to be the No. 1 safest city in the nation.îPrimarily Republican senators and primarily Democratic House members are likely to deliver a compromise spending plan next week that likely will not have anywhere near the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded as a down payment for the $25 billion wall he once insisted he would make Mexico pay for.While Trump could choose to veto a spending bill and trigger another shutdown, his GOP allies believe he is more likely to declare a national emergency and try to divert money from already approved projects in the budgets for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers.Doing so would likely trigger lawsuits as well as the drafting and passage of a ìjoint resolutionî of disapproval in the Democratic-controlled House. After it is sent to the Senate, it can be called to the floor after 15 days, and McConnell would have no power to block it.Whatís more, that particular resolution is not subject to a filibuster, meaning it would need only 51 votes to pass, not 60. Trump could only afford to lose three Republicans ó and could possibly lose a good deal more.Some Republican senators worry about ceding too much power to Trump, particularly on spending matters, because he could set a precedent that subsequent Democratic presidents could use to declare national emergencies for, say, climate change or universal health care.ìIím urging the president to tread carefully,î said Texas Republican John Cornyn.Susan Collins and John Thune, of Maine and South Dakota, both told reporters this week that they hope Trump does not declare a national emergency. Missouriís Roy Blunt said that he, too, was not a fan of the approach. ìI think Iíve expressed serious concern about going down that path but letís wait and see what the president does before we decide,î he said.Their advice, though, may be falling on deaf ears. In his most detailed remarks on the topic recently, Trump appeared to have made up his mind. ìI think thereís a good chance weíll have to do that,î he told reporters late last week. ìWe will be looking at a national emergency, because I donít think anything is going to happen. I think the Democrats donít want border security.îIf Congress were to pass the disapproval measure, Trump would have the opportunity to veto it.

And with new advances in technology, the projectís creators say the process can be done cheaply and legally at home.Atlas Arms, a firearms research nonprofit based in Tennessee, is working to develop a computer-aided design file of the bullets, and plans to release it for free to the public. People would then be able to download the blueprint and input it into a computerized milling machine, which would carve rounds out of a base material purchased separately by the user.In a news release last week, Atlas Arms argued that armor-piercing ammunition is ìcritical to a well-regulated militia,î because the government is already able to use such bullets. The project, called the Dagny Dagger, is an attempt to ìreclaim the forbidden fire, by outflanking the regulatorsí definitions and imaginations,î the group wrote. (Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.)The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has yet to approve the Dagny Dagger. A spokesperson for the bureau did not respond to a request for comment. Like many federal agencies, the ATF is currently being affected by the government shutdown.The Dagny Dagger is the latest entrant into the rapidly evolving world of DIY gunsmithing, which in recent years has ignited a contentious battle around intertwined issues of gun rights and freedom of speech and information.Last year, self-described ìcrypto anarchistî Cody Wilson drew nationwide attention when his company, Defense Distributed, began publishing downloadable blueprints for 3D-printed plastic guns. At the time, Wilson said he believed having a gun was a ìfundamental human dignityî and a ìhuman right.î He was also open about the subversive nature of his mission to create a world in which anyone with a 3-D printer and an internet connection could have access to firearms, which he claimed would lead to the death of gun control. A federal court eventually put a temporary hold on distribution of the Defense Distributed plans, but not before thousands of people got hold of them.Efforts to undermine the governmentís ability to regulate firearms have long been essential to pro-gun activists and lawmakers, said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University whoís written about regulatory issues around guns. ìThis is part and parcel of the mainstream gun rights movement,î he said.Austin Jones, a former aerospace engineer leading design efforts around the Dagny Dagger, told HuffPost that he ìadmiredî Wilsonís work and shares his mission to ìbuild a prohibition-proof future.î In an email, Jones said his goal is to help equip everyone with armor-piercing ammunition, including anti-government militia groups. ìTheyíre sure to want to maintain weapons that are still relevant in a modern firefight and on-par with their most-likely opponent,î Jones said.The sale and manufacture of armor-piercing rounds was banned in 1986, under a bipartisan measure signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. The legislation covered handgun bullets manufactured with specific metals or designs that increase their ability to penetrate bulletproof vests commonly worn by police and other government officials.That regulatory framework still exists today, but the creators of the new campaign say their bullets will comply with federal law <U+2015> largely because theyíre being designed using a model that is deliberately intended to circumvent the ban, according to Jones.Each Dagny Dagger round is expected to cost about $2, though Atlas Arms says it hopes eventually to halve that price. The company is beginning with designs for a 9 mm round that it says will be able to ìdefeat all level III body armor,î which is supposed to provide protection against most handgun and rifle threats. †The ATF has fairly wide discretion in determining whether a new design is forbidden by existing law, though such rulings are often beholden to the political climate of the overseeing agency or presidential administration. While the ATF generally has a pro-law enforcement orientation and tends to be ìextremely suspiciousî of efforts to increase civilian firepower, Lytton said, itís harder to predict how President Donald Trump might approach the issue.ìPart of his base is law enforcement and people who would be extremely opposed to allowing this kind of variation on armor-piercing ammunition, while another part of his base is gung ho to try and circumvent the kinds of controls we have on firearms and ammunition,î Lytton said. ìWhich part of his constituency he nods to really does depend on his current mood and the last person to have spoken to him.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

So obvious. So predictable. So pathetic,î Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group Americaís Voice, tweeted on Tuesday.The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country. It would also cap the number of Central American minors who are allowed to apply for asylum each year at 50,000 and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted per year to 15,000.†The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Trumpís administrative attempts to curtail the asylum process have faced legal challenges in two federal courts, however, prompting this weekís legislative fix.ìThis bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that Iíve ever seen,î Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday.Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous <U+2015> including permanent ineligibility for future protections.The billís changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor.Anyway, I'll look through it again tomorrow, but Democrats shouldn't support this bill, and to be honest, Republicans should be shooting question marks at McConnell too.Trumpís efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill <U+2015> which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate <U+2015> hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administrationís effort to end DACA. The move essentially left protections for Dreamers in place for at least the next several months <U+2015> giving Democrats less incentive to agree to Trumpís offer of protections to DACA recipients.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly included Sudan among the countries for which immigrantsí temporary protected status would be extended.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Now in its fourth week, it has become the longest shutdown in U.S. history.While the official who spoke to Axios contended that Mulvaney had a positive rapport with the president, a 2015 radio interview resurfaced by CNNís KFile showed that Mulvaney once called Trumpís position on the wall ìabsurd and almost childish.îFurthermore, in 2016, The State, a South Carolina newspaper, reported that in the run-up to Election Day, Mulvaney said he was supporting Trump ìdespite the fact that I think heís a terrible human being.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

President Donald Trump has refused to reopen the government unless Congress gives him around $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border, a sticking point Democrats have refused to budge on.†Hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed their first paycheck of the year on Friday, many of whom have still been required to go to work during the shutdown. Congress approved a bill last week to grant back pay to those workers and others who were furloughed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has signaled that Trump will sign it when it reaches his desk.Pressure has been building on both sides of the aisle to end the shutdown amid worries from Republicans that the standoff is hurting the partyís reputation. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an ardent supporter of the president, urged Trump on Sunday to temporarily reopen the government while negotiations continued and attempted to talk him off plans to declare a national emergency. Trump has been mulling that option as a means to bypass Congress and build his wall unilaterally, although such an effort would prompt a near-immediate legal battle.He has reportedly†pulled back from that option in recent days.ìI would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug,î Graham said during a ìFox News Sundayî interview. ìSee if we can get a deal.

Some hold only general or hazy concerns.†But with thousands of workers now missing paychecks, others cite more concrete, imminent harms.ì[Our son] is an essential federal worker with a one year old and no way to buy diapers or baby food,î wrote one Arizona woman, who described her family as devastated by the impact.†ìHe has to work but is not being paid. I am helping him out but my funds are limited too. Also, my son in law is on unpaid leave but luckily my daughter is working full time. But sheís going on maternity leave in March so they wonít have any money, either.îA Democrat, the woman gave low marks to President Trump and the Republicans for their actions, but said she believed her party was making a good-faith effort to end the standoff.Views about whoís to blame for the shutdown remain sharply divided along partisan lines.†Another woman surveyed also said her family members are going unpaid.†She described herself as very concerned about the shutdown and held the president and both parties in Congress at least somewhat responsible. But as a Republican,†she also backed Trumpís desire to hold out for a border wall and believed that he and his congressional allies were working to bring the shutdown to an end.Overall, as in previous HuffPost/YouGov surveys, Americans give everyone in Washington low marks for their handling of the shutdown <U+2015> but the GOP is faring especially badly. Americans are 45 percentage points likelier to disapprove than to approve of the performance by Congress as a whole. They disapprove of congressional Republicans by a 29-point margin, of Trump by a 17-point margin and of congressional Democrats by a 13-point margin. Members of the public are close to evenly split on how they feel about the performance of their own representatives.††In the newest HuffPost/YouGov poll, 57 percent of Americans say they hold Trump at least partially responsible for the shutdown, an uptick from the 49 to 51 percent who have†said the same in previous weeks.†The 44 percent of the public who assign some responsibility to the Democrats and the 39 percent who point to the Republicans are less changed from previous surveys, although the GOP number is slightly increased.Americans say by a 23-point margin that Republicans are playing politics rather than working in good faith to end the shutdown. They say the same of Trump by a 19-point margin and of Democrats by a 14-point margin.Several other polls about the shutdown have also been released since Friday. Taken together, they paint a consistent picture thatís also in accordance with earlier surveys: When asked whoís most to blame for the shutdown, Americans largely point their fingers at the president. Some of the highlights:†<U+2015>In†a CNN/SSRS poll released Sunday morning, 55 percent of Americans hold Trump mostly responsible for the shutdown, with 32 percent blaming congressional Democrats and 9 percent saying both are responsible. Fifty-six percent of Americans say they oppose building a wall along the border with Mexico.<U+2015>Americans ìreject the presidentís assertion that there is an illegal-immigration crisis on the southern border,î according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey released Sunday.†In that survey, 53 percent of Americans say Trump and the Republicans are mainly to blame for the shutdown, with 29 percent calling Democrats mostly at fault, and 13 percent believing both sides share equal responsibility.†A 54 percent majority oppose building a border wall, although thatís down from 63 percent in a Post/ABC survey taken last year <U+2015> the change is due largely to increased support among Republicans.†<U+2015>Trump, Democrats and Republicans ìall draw lackluster marks for their handling of the government shutdown,î according to a CBS/YouGov survey out Friday.†Forty-seven percent say that Trump is most to blame, 30 percent that Democrats are, 3 percent that Republicans are, and 20 percent that all share the blame equally.†Two-thirds of Americans donít think Trump should declare a national emergency to pay for a wall if one isnít funded by Congress.†<U+2015>Three-quarters of the public, including most Republicans, think the shutdown is ìembarrassing for the country,î per an NPR/Ipsos survey released Friday.†About 7 in 10 agree that the shutdown will hurt the country and economy, with a similar number saying Congress should pass a bill to reopen the government now while budget talks continue. Just 31 percent want the government to remain closed until a border wall is funded.<U+2015>Reuters/Ipsos tracking†finds that 51 percent majority of Americans now give Trump the most blame for the shutdown, up from about 46 percent at its start. Democrats receive about 32 percent of the blame and Republicans about 7 percent.(A methodology sidenote: The new Post/ABC and CNN/SSRS polls are also notable for being the first of this shutdown to be conducted using traditional live-interviewer phone calls, rather than cheaper methods such as online surveys. That fact highlights how much the face of political polling has changed since the 1995 shutdown, when pollsters like Gallup were conducting multiple surveys a week on the political ramifications of the governmentís closure. Gallup, under new leadership,†recently announced it would ìdiscontinue almost all ëspotí polls in the U.S. ó overnight polls, usually political, of immediate front-page interest.î)As is often true in polling, the framing of a question about the shutdown can have a significant effect on the responses.†Survey questions about whoís responsible are a case in point. Some polls have asked Americans to pick between blaming Trump, Democrats or Republicans. In those surveys, very few respondents name congressional Republicans as the group primarily to blame.But does that mean people are inclined to let the Republicans off easy? The Post/ABC survey, which instead ties Trump and the congressional GOP together, finds them mutually shouldering the blame. And in the HuffPost/YouGov poll, GOP legislatorsí overall marks on the shutdown are actually worse than either Trumpís or their Democratic counterpartsí.Neither format for those questions is inherently wrong. But it does matter which of those frames manages to best represent the way ordinary people are thinking about the shutdown when theyíre†not†fielding direct questions about it from pollsters.So far, despite the†claim of Trumpís campaign manager†that the shutdown has boosted the presidentís numbers, thereís little publicly available data to suggest that the shutdown has been politically helpful to anyone.†At best, surveys show Trumpís numbers remaining more or less stagnant. Several†poll aggregators, meanwhile, have found Trumpís disapproval rating rising modestly in the new year, albeit remaining well within the narrow range of approval ratings seen in his presidency thus far.†As hazy as the immediate political impact of the shutdown may be, its implications for the future are still more unclear. In the past, those effects have often been ephemeral. The 2013 government shutdown†sent ratings for the Republican Party falling to historic lows, but faded quickly from public memory and didnít prevent the GOP from claiming victory in the midterms a year later.†As the current shutdown stretches on, however, thereís still room for that calculus to change.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGovís opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.†You can learn more about this project and†take part in YouGovís nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the pollsí methodology are available†here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGovís reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.†Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Big Tommy, who served as a Maryland congressman and later the mayor of Baltimore.ìBig Tommy DíAlesandro Jr. taught little Nancy how to count,î Dowd wrote. ìFred Trump taught Donald, from the time he was a baby, that he didnít have to count ó or be accountable; Daddyís money made him and buoyed him.îThe scathing column called out what Dowd identified as major contrasts in the childhoods of Donald Trump and Pelosi, presenting one as the antithesis of the other.For the columnist, the point of digging into the past was to further understand the divide between the president and the congresswoman as the partial federal government shutdown wades into week four.ìAt this fraught moment when the pain of the shutdown is kicking in, President Trump and Speaker Pelosi offer very different visions ó shaped by their parents ó of what it means to be an American,î Dowd said.The problem, she contended, is that unlike Pelosi, Trump was never really raised to be an adult, his father having bailed him out of trouble time and time again.ìOver the years, Fred funneled tens of millions of dollars to clean up Donaldís messes,î Dowd wrote. ìThe father even gave the son $3.5 million in chips to save an Atlantic City casino. By the time he was in his 40s, Donnieís allowance was more than $5 million annually. No wonder heís still an infant.îSaving her most searing words for last, Dowd ended the column by suggesting it was useless for Pelosi to deploy ìher ëmother of fiveí voice on our tantrum-prone president, perhaps in an effort to reparent him,î asking, ìhow do you discipline the worldís brattiest 72-year-old?îPelosi continues to butt heads with Trump over his demands for more than $5 billion to build a border wall, a request that sent the government into its prolonged shutdown.She has teamed with Senate Minority Leader†Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) in opposing the wall, which she called an immoral ìwaste of moneyî this month.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Dowdís column compared Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi as the children of immigrants.

The woman, who said that she ended up at the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center after fleeing an abusive boyfriend in another state, had saved $600 <U+2015> enough for the first monthís rent in a mobile home. In December, the staff at the shelter offered to cover†her security deposit, using a special fund for emergency client expenses. For the woman, a new start was within reach. She paid the application fee and was approved for the rental. And then, the government shutdown happened. The shelter could no longer help her with housing costs. She lost the mobile home. ìI feel hurt, hurt, hurt,î she said. ìIím already starting out with absolutely nothing. I donít know what is going to happen now.î The government shutdown <U+2015> which on Saturday became the longest in U.S. history <U+2015> has thrown the fate of domestic violence shelters across the country in limbo. Many, like the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center, rely heavily on federal funds to stay afloat. With the government closed for business, they canít access the federal payments they so desperately need. The same funds they planned to use to help the woman with housing.Not knowing when the shutdown will end, shelters around the country are preparing for the worst. Many are curtailing services, cutting all but the most essential costs and planning for layoffs.Katie Spriggs, executive director of the Eastern Panhandle Empowerment Center, said her agency can no longer afford to provide any financial support to its clients. In addition to helping clients find permanent housing <U+2015> which moves them out of shelter, opening up a spot for another person in need <U+2015> the shelter also offers support for taxi rides to appointments and prescription medicines. ìThe things that we know they need to make their daily lives easier <U+2015> even if it only costs a little bit of money <U+2015> we canít help with now,î she said. Many of their clients live in extreme poverty, she said. For some, financial insecurity is the main reason why they donít leave their partners. They simply canít afford it. ìPeople will call and say íI would love to come in, but I have no way to get to work on Monday, or no way to get my kids to school,î she explained. ìWe used to tell them not to worry because we could alleviate some of that financial burden. But now we canít because we donít have any money.î The center has also been forced to halt another crucial program: Mobile outreach. Normally, advocates make daily trips to visit abuse victims in their own homes who canít make it into the shelter for services. Many women in the community donít own vehicles, Spriggs added. Others are too sick or depressed to leave the house or have young children. ìSo we meet them where they are,î she said. Advocates will assess their needs and help them fill out paperwork for court, such as protective orders and divorce and custody filings, and do safety planning.Spriggs said she was concerned about the victims who are missing out on services because they cannot make it into the shelter. She is also concerned about having to lay off staff. If the shutdown does not end within two weeks, that will become a reality, she said.Inside the shelter, the mood was somber. Lisa, a 45-year-old woman with a traumatic brain injury, said she had been living in the shelter for two months. The shutdown had already negatively impacted her life. The shelter could not afford to pay for her transport to her doctorís office, so she had missed a few medical appointments. They couldnít pay for her prescriptions at CVS, so she was going without. And instead of the hot meals usually served, they were eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, she said. Food was being rationed to save money.†ìYou can feel the stress in the air,î she said. ìWe try to work as a family, they are a lot of very wonderful women here, but it is hard right now.î Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Just seven members voted against it, all Republicans:Justin Amash (Mich.)Andy Biggs (Ariz.)Paul Gosar (Ariz.)Glenn Grothman (Wisc.)Thomas Massie (Ky.)Chip Roy (Tex.)Ted Yoho (Fla.)Polling indicates that Americans are more likely to blame Trump for the shutdown than congressional Democrats. Not approving the backpay measure could come off as an unnecessarily cruel decision from the president.

But those workers still have bills to pay and wonít receive their wages until the government reopens and enough time passes to process payroll.The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, an advocacy group for federal workers, said the legislation provides ìsome comfortî to the federal workforce but isnít ìan immediate solutionî to the mounting problems created by the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22.ìFederal employees are scrambling to make arrangements for unpaid bills, including tapping their retirement accounts,î Ken Thomas, the groupís president, said in a statement. ìEvictions are becoming a real possibility, medical issues go untended, local economies are suffering and services to citizens have ceased as workloads pile up.î The partial government shutdown marked its 21st day on Friday, and it is now tied for the position of the longest shutdown on record. Trump is demanding $5.7 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused to give him that money. The president has said he is considering declaring a national emergency to secure the funding, a move that would inevitably draw legal challenges.Because of the impasse, Congress has not appropriated money for roughly one-quarter of the federal government, leading to furloughs at agencies such as the Interior Department and the Department of Homeland Security. For thousands of workers, Friday marked the first typical payday without any pay.Workers are planning to use several strategies to eke by without steady income, including taking out loans, applying for unemployment benefits, borrowing money from family members and even forgoing medication.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Operations at nine departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, have been affected.The government shutdown began Dec. 22 and is now the second-longest ever. Because of the lapse in funding for roughly a quarter of the government, about 380,000 workers have been furloughed and sent home while 420,000 continue to work as ìessentialî employees but without pay. Many of the essential workers are law enforcement personnel in the Department of Homeland Security, including Border Patrol and Transportation Security Administration agents.Many stories of federal workers anxious about paying their bills have emerged, even as thousands of employees have continued to work without any guarantee theyíll be compensated after the shutdown ends.ìMorale is, I believe, close to rock bottom, and I think things will start getting really bad if this isnít fixed by this weekend,î a TSA officer who last received a paycheck on Dec. 28 told HuffPostís Nick Robins-Early.Congress would have to pass a law granting those workers backpay once the government reopens, as it has after previous shutdowns. Many workers received their last paycheck shortly before the new year and now may have to rely on savings, loans, credit or unemployment benefits to cover their bills.The impasse is the result of Trumpís demand that Congress sign off on more than $5.7 billion for a wall along the southern border, a structure he originally said Mexico would pay for. He has not budged on his request, and Democratic leaders have refused to give in, describing the wall as wasteful and foolhardy. The White House is now flirting with declaring a national emergency in order to secure the funding.Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said Trump was holding the federal government ìhostage.îìOver 200,000 employees at DHS <U+2015> charged with protecting our skies, waterways, and borders <U+2015> will also not be paid while still working,î Thompson said in a statement. ìBecause of the Presidentís childish behavior, families will face difficulties paying rent, keeping the lights on, and putting food on the dinner table. He should not be treating them like pawns in his pathetic pursuit to fulfill an absurd campaign promise.îThe White House has also felt the effects of the shutdown, with only 156 employees deemed essential out of 359.†Efforts to reopen the government have largely floundered since the start of the year, and the shutdown is on track to become the longest since the 1970s if it isnít resolved by Saturday. The president reportedly stormed out of a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) on Wednesday after being told they would not give in to his demands, slamming his hands on a table and saying, ìBye-bye.îThe Democratic leaders have criticized the presidentís behavior, equating it to a temper tantrum.ìIt wasnít even a high-stakes negotiation,î Pelosi said Wednesday. ìIt was a petulant president of the United States.îTrump is getting more comfortable with the prospect of securing wall funding through a national emergency declaration. Several media reports noted the president has been eyeing billions of dollars in disaster recovery and military construction funding from the Defense Department to build the wall, and a source told The Washington Post that Trump would like to begin work on the wall within the next 45 days.Title 10 of the U.S. Code allows the use of such unspent money in the case of a national emergency.The president,†in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity during a visit to the southern border on Thursday, said that if he canít make a deal with Congress, heíll†ìmost likelyî seek to declare a national emergency.ìThe law is 100 percent on my side,î Trump said. ìI mean we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, and this is security stuff.

They should do it immediately,î Trump said, referring to Democrats in Congress who have not agreed to the presidentís demand of $5.7 billion for the wall. †††ìLook, weíre not going anywhere,î he continued. ìWeíre not changing our minds.îThe government remains in a partial shutdown as Trump and Democrats fail to reach an agreement over how much money in the federal budget should be set aside for his proposed wall.Democrats have offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which includes building and refurbishing barriers at the border, but Trump has reportedly refused any offer less than his demand of $5.7 billion.Reacting to the stonewalled negotiations, the president last week began threatening to declare a national emergency in order to circumvent Congress and build the border wall ìvery quickly.î†By declaring a national emergency, the Trump administration would gain access to funds to build his wall elsewhere in the government.Trump is already moving forward with these plans by reportedly looking into spending money in the Department of Defenseís disaster recovery and military construction fund that hasnít yet been spent. Such drastic measures would likely prompt Democrats in Congress to legally challenge the administration for violating the appropriations clause in the Constitution.Late Thursday, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security had already slammed the administration over reports that Trump was considering using disaster recovery funds, and he promised to stop any efforts to do so.In a statement, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) demanded that Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen ìdisavowî the reports.ìThese funds were intended by Congress to be used for real emergencies and to help millions recover from hurricanes and other disasters,î Thompson said. ìUnder no circumstance are these funds to be used to fund the Presidentís pet project so he can claim a win.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I am sure the wildlife do not feel protected by being shot,î Ruch said.Critics say that, although the administration is protecting and encouraging aggressive consumption of public land during the shutdown, there is little to nothing being done to protect wildlife and habitat.

The organization represented Kim Davis, the now-former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses†to same-sex couples. Staver, who served as her lawyer, painted her as an evangelical Christian heroine, comparing her at one point to Jewish people who were persecuted by the Nazis.On its surface, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act isnít about queer rights. The bill addresses the crime of lynching <U+2015> extrajudicial executions carried out by a mob. According to the NAACP, lynching was used after the Civil War to resolve ìsome of the anger that whites had in relation to the free blacks.î At least 4,742 people, predominantly African-Americans, were reportedly lynched in America from 1882 to 1968.Since a new session of Congress has begun, the Senate-approved act and a corresponding bill in the House†thatís still in committee will likely have to be reintroduced.As of now, the Senate bill†defines lynching†as two or more people ìwillfully caus[ing] bodily injuryî because of the victimís actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, disability, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.Staver told OneNewsNow that if passed, the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would be the first federal law to mention gender identity and sexual orientation.Jenny Pizer, the law and policy director for the advocacy organization Lambda Legal, refuted that idea. She pointed to the†Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which passed in 2009 and covered crimes motivated by a victimís actual or†perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. The Violence Against Women Act, which expired in December amid the partial government shutdown, also explicitly mentioned sexual orientation and gender identity.Pizer said LGBTQ Americans still urgently need comprehensive and explicit federal anti-discrimination laws. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, only a minority of states have laws that specifically protect queer people.†Lambda Legal, the ACLU, and other progressive organizations have been pushing for the passage of the Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination against queer people in employment, housing, education and other areas of their lives.ìBecause there continues to be confusion and debate about whether LGBTQ people already are legally equal ó and whether or not we should be equal ó we need the law to be inclusive and crystal clear,î Pizer told HuffPost in an email.In response to backlash it received for Staverís position on the anti-lynching bill, Liberty Counsel released a statement Thursday claiming that what he actually meant in the OneNewsNow interview was that including a list of protected categories in the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act would limit the lawís application.ìLynching should be prohibited no matter the personís reason for committing this violent crime,î†Staver said in the statement.The organization also said it has received death threats over the issue.In a YouTube video defending the organization, Jonathan Alexandre, Liberty Counselís public policy director, said that some politicians and media organizations are using lynchingís ìhorrible historyî to ìpush unrelated political agendas.î He confirmed that Liberty Counsel is questioning members of Congress about the ìcreated list of protected categories.îìThe historical victims of lynching should not, as I do not, tolerate the hijacking of this issue by political agenda,î he said.†Liberty Counsel has not responded to a request for comment on why it believes LGBTQ Americans should not be treated as a protected class.†Pizer said she believes Liberty Counsel has repeatedly used an ìends-justify-the-means approachî to furthering its goals.ìWith the grossly disproportionate rates of hate crimes against LGBTQ people, and the horrifying rate of murders of transgender women of color in particular, a demand to strip [sexual orientation and gender identity] out of an anti-lynching bill is truly dumbfounding, and beyond comprehension,î she said. ìThat it would be done by someone claiming to be motivated by Christian teachings just shows how deeply perverse and inhumane that anti-LGBT advocacy can become.î"

Republicans and Democrats have basically stopped negotiating. Yet, members and aides on Capitol Hill believe a solution is imminent.Itís not that thereís going to be a legislative breakthrough. Itís more that everyone now recognizes there is no deal to be made <U+2015> not when President Donald Trump wonít come down from his $5.7 billion figure for border wall construction, conservatives oppose a larger immigration deal, and Democrats donít trust and wonít accept any offer but full capitulation.Instead, the solution to the impasse seems to be Trump declaring a national emergency at the border, using a dubious authority to reprogram military construction money for the wall, and then Congress passing clean funding legislation <U+2015> without wall money <U+2015> while Trumpís executive maneuver gets tied up in court.Trump has moved from toying with the idea of a national emergency declaration to all but promising it. He said Thursday that, if negotiations donít work out, ìprobably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.îThree senior GOP aides said Thursday that they expect Trump to declare a national emergency as a way of getting out of the shutdown, though all said they hadnít heard anything specific about timing. And while thereís been a scramble among some lawmakers to put together a deal involving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program in exchange for wall funding, that offer seems to be dead on arrival.According to Politico, the chief architect of a DACA deal, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), has all but given up. ìI think weíre stuck. I just donít see a pathway forward. I donít see a way forward,î Graham said Thursday. ìI have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now.îSo with the grand immigration bargain falling apart before it ever came together, and with Trump stuck on $5.7 billion for the wall and Democrats stuck on $0, the logical conclusion for most lawmakers is Trump acting through executive power.Specifically, Trump would use existing authority to reprogram unspent funds for military construction <U+2015> or redesignate funds earmarked for ongoing projects <U+2015> and build his wall that way. Thereís believed to be about $13 billion floating around in the military construction budget that hasnít been spent, along with $10 billion in new money for projects in fiscal 2019 <U+2015> more than enough for Trump to get started on his border wall. In effect, however, the move would be challenged in court immediately, tied up for years potentially.If there were enough backlash in Congress, Democrats and Republicans could team up to pass legislation blocking Trumpís use of the military construction fund for his wall. But initial reactions from Republicans have skewed more toward support, or at least not opposition, for Trump declaring a national emergency to subvert Congress.On Thursday evening, Graham tweeted his support of Trump using an emergency declaration to build the wall.And House Republicans were just as deferential Thursday when HuffPost continued asking members about Trump potentially using his executive power to build the wall.ìHopefully negotiations will work, but if the Democrats refuse to negotiate, I donít think the president has much of a choice,î Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Thursday.And even among those who said they would ìpreferî Congress fund the wall <U+2015> members such as Reps. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) and Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) <U+2015> no one was willing to lay out what repercussions they would support if Trump acted on his own.HuffPost repeatedly asked Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) on Thursday whether she opposed the president declaring a national emergency to build the wall, and she repeatedly restated her position that ìCongress needs to do our jobî without actually answering the question. (She actually offered some variation of ìCongress needs to assert its authorityî or ìCongress needs to do our jobî five times when HuffPost asked if she opposed the president declaring an emergency.)The point is, Republicans may not love†Trump going around Congress, but they donít seem willing to do anything real to block him at this time.On top of that reluctance to openly oppose Trump, lawmakers see the utility of Trump claiming victory and reopening government, with neither side actually giving an inch. Trump would not get to build his wall <U+2015> at least not until a court said so <U+2015> and Democrats would get to end the shutdown without giving the president a dollar.The difficulty is such an arrangement will inevitably derail future appropriations talks, as Democrats would push for riders blocking Trumpís authority to reprogram money and the president wouldnít sign a bill undercutting his ability to unilaterally build his wall, even if the ultimate decision was for the courts.Basically, weíd just be deferring the fight for the time being. But such a move seems like the least messy option as more than 800,000 government workers continue to go without paychecks.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

These policies are not coming out of nowhere. Most of them have been implemented and tested in cities and states across the country.ìWithin the last five or six years, you just got more and more of these solutions happening at the state and local level,î said Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the billís chief sponsor. ìItís not a unicorn. Itís not like weíre talking about something that exists in the atmosphere of Jupiter. This is happening in America.îSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, in a famous dissenting opinion from 1932, asserted the freedom of a state or local government to ìserve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.î This ìlaboratories of democracyî concept holds that state and local governments are the proper place to test policies before they move to the national stage.That is exactly what has happened with the sweeping policies in Democratsí H.R. 1, which theyíre calling the For the People Act. The billís campaign finance provisions on public election financing, dark money disclosure and democracy vouchers have all been field tested. The same is true of automatic voter registration, felon re-enfranchisement and the use of independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions.Since 2015, 15 states and the District of Columbia have adopted automatic voter registration, a popular reform among advocates who believe it can significantly expand the number of people on the voting rolls in the United States.The policy works slightly differently in each state, but the basic premise is the same: When someone interacts with the state motor vehicle or other agencies, they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out. If they are already registered, their information gets updated if needed. Federal law already requires state motor vehicle and some state agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote, and automatic voter registration essentially tweaks the process to make registering an opt-out choice instead of an opt-in.Oregon, considered the model for automatic voter registration, was the first state in the country to pass it in 2015. While itís still relatively early to assess the impact, the early evidence is encouraging. The policy went into effect in January 2016 and in a little over a year and a half, the policy added 375,000 people to the voter rolls. A 2017 analysis from the left-leaning Center for American Progress found over 116,000 people had been added to the rolls who wouldnít have otherwise registered.Automatic voter registration also went into effect in California last year, where it added 727,924 new voters to the rolls since its launch in April and updated the addresses of 269,365 people. (There were around 5.5 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state as of October.) The program also attracted scrutiny when it emerged the DMV made errors on thousands of voter registrations, including registering people who were ineligible to vote. The head of the DMV resigned and the agency imposed an additional level of review on the voter registrations it received.Forty-eight states donít allow people with felony convictions to vote while they are incarcerated, but states have widely different policies on when and how ex-felons can get back their right to vote. Some states allow former felons to vote once theyíre released from prison, while others bar them while theyíre on probation or parole. The various policies can be extremely confusing†and deter people from registering to vote, even if theyíre eligible.The For the People Act aims to fix this problem by automatically restoring voting rights once someone is released from prison. Currently, 13 states and the District of Columbia do this, but having a federal statute would help make the process easier for everyone involved.ìI think having a uniform rule that applies to everyone, everywhere and making that loud and having some action on it would be really helpful,î said Sean Morales-Doyle, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based nonprofit advocating for campaign finance reform and voting rights. ìHaving a uniform policy would clear up confusion among voters. It would also clear up confusion among elections officials. It would make keeping track of voter lists a lot easier.îThe Supreme Courtís 2010 Citizens United decision led to an explosion of undisclosed money spent by nonprofits, trade associations and corporate entities in elections. Congress attempted to fix the courtís collateral damage to transparency with the Disclose Act in 2010, but it fell one vote short of clearing a Republican filibuster in the Senate.States have since stepped in to pass their own Disclose Acts or to issue regulations to stop dark money in state elections. Varying disclosure rules to plug the holes created by the Supreme Court have been adopted in California, Delaware, Montana, New York, Texas, Vermont and Washington. Some of these laws provide more disclosure than others, and that can help Congress determine the best option for federal elections.ìCaliforniaís Disclose Act is great but limited,î said former Federal Election Commission Chairwoman Ann Ravel, now with the pro-disclosure nonprofit MapLight.The California government has enacted two disclosure bills since the Citizens United decision. The first was passed in 2014 to require any group spending more than $50,000 on elections to disclose its donors. The second, enacted in 2017, mostly focuses on requiring independent spenders to post disclaimers detailing their top three donors on their advertising and campaign materials. Ravel believes that the $50,000 threshold for disclosure could be lower <U+2015> which is something the House Democratsí bill does.A little-noticed provision in Democratsí big reform bill would create a pilot program for ìdemocracy vouchersî <U+2015> a proposal to provide every citizen with vouchers that can be used as small-dollar political donations. These vouchers would come in $25 increments, but could be used to give donations as low as $1.The ìdemocracy vouchersî idea was first proposed by constitutional law professor Bruce Ackerman decades ago, but had never been adopted until Seattle voters backed a 2015 initiative to implement the idea. The program has already enabled a large number of people who would otherwise be incapable of affording political donations, including homeless people, to participate in the political process by contributing to candidates. One study found that 84 percent of people who used used their vouchers in the cityís 2017 elections had not made a political contribution in at least the previous two election cycles.The vouchers also provide an alternative fundraising system for candidates who lack the kind of connections to big-money donors that are often seen as necessary to run for office.In 2017, Seattle City Council candidate Teresa Mosqueda became the first person in the country to win their first election running with democracy vouchers. She had kept hearing that she should run for City Council from participants in a program she ran for the AFL-CIO that encouraged women, people of color and working-class people to run for office. She was the kind of person she was trying to get to run: a Latina in the labor movement who didnít come from money. But her background also presented an obstacle to funding a campaign <U+2015> until Seattleís democracy vouchers became available.ìThe democracy vouchers program really took the pressure away from having to see yourself bankrolling a campaign or frankly having to dial for dollars for the majority of your time,î Mosqueda said.ìI was able to spend more time talking with people about what they wanted to see in government,î she added.The pilot program in the Democratsí bill would be implemented in three randomly selected states to test how it works for congressional elections and whether it should be expanded to the whole country.The For the People Act would require states to allow people to register on the same day they vote and to allow voters to cast ballots for at least 15 consecutive days before Election Day. It would require poll sites to be open at least four hours each of those days and, to the greatest extent possible, that they be located near public transportation.Twenty states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of same-day registration. Itís seen as a reform that can greatly drive up voter participation rates because people start paying more attention to an election the closer it gets. Federal law currently lets states cut off voter registration 30 days before an election. Activists also embrace early voting because it gives people more time to go to the polls at their convenience.Early voting in particular has been at the center of many recent fights between Republicans and Democrats over voting laws. The conventional wisdom is that early voting benefits Democrats, so Republicans in several states have moved to limit its availability. But one 2017 paper published by four political scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that reality may be more complicated. The authors analyzed early voting in the 2004, 2008 and 2012 presidential elections and found that while Election Day registration tends to benefit Democrats, early voting on its own is more likely to benefit Republicans.ìThe type of voter who takes advantage of early voting <U+2015> older, whiter, and wealthier <U+2015> is already likely to vote, and more likely to vote Republican,î the authors wrote in a blog post last year. ìOur findings confirm that early voting on its own has a negative and statistically significant effect on Democratic vote share in all three presidential elections we analyzed. The availability of early voting in isolation raises the Republican vote by about six percentage points.îWhen same-day registration is combined with early voting, the paper found, voter turnout aligns more with the conventional wisdom.H.R. 1 would require states to create independent commissions that would be responsible for drawing congressional districts. State lawmakers currently have the power to draw districts once a decade, and both parties have manipulated that process to their advantage. In 2011, Republicans saw an opportunity to take control of state legislatures, control the redistricting process and lock in an electoral advantage for the next decade. They executed that plan extremely precisely and well.Six states <U+2015> Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana and Washington <U+2015> use independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for state or congressional districts. (Voters in Michigan, Utah and Colorado passed ballot measures establishing independent commissions in the November election.) Advocates say lawmakers have firm incentives to draw districts that favor their parties, and the independent commissions offer a firm check to make sure districts are fair.†In 2011, Californiaís independent redistricting commission drew electoral boundaries for the state for the first time. Anyone can apply to serve on the 14-member commission <U+2015> which is made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people not affiliated with either party <U+2015> but there are strict requirements on who can serve. Eligible applicants must be registered to vote in California and have voted in two of the last three elections. In the 10 years leading up to submitting their application, they also canít†have run for office, worked for a lawmaker, political party or as a lobbyist, or donated $2,000 or more to a party or candidate. Votes from multiple Democrats, Republicans and independents are required to approve a plan. H.R. 1 would impose similar safeguards on the independent commissions it creates to help ensure the districts are fair.ìWhen lawmakers draw their own lines, they lose all of their philosophical ideals and they become ugly monsters that are willing to cut out competitors, punish people from the other party and try to draw the most protective district for themselves so they donít have to face serious competition for the next 10 years,î said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director at the good government group Common Cause, which championed the creation of Californiaís commission.The For the People Actís main campaign finance reform is the creation of a small-donor matching system to publicly finance congressional elections. It is based on the decades-old public financing program run for New York City elections.New York adopted a small-donor matching system to publicly finance its elections in 1988 in response to a series of corruption scandals throughout city government. At the time, the system provided a 1-to-1 match for donations of $1,000 or less. A candidate received $1 in public funds for every $1 of a contribution up to $1,000. But the system has changed to boost the power of small donors over the years.Proponents of New York Cityís matching fund system point to changes that greatly enhanced the role of small donors as the public match was increased and the contribution limit for matching funds was lowered. Currently, the system provides an 8-to-1 match for contributions up to $175. That means a $175 contribution actually counts as a $1,575 contribution after the public funds are added in. Democratsí For the People Act uses a 6-to-1 match, a rate used by the New York City system from 2009 through 2018, for contributions up to $200.ìThe fact that itís been around for 30 years and itís still working, I think thatís pretty remarkable,î said Lawrence Norden, a lawyer for the Brennan Center for Justice.New York Cityís system has enabled candidates <U+2015> especially those from less affluent neighborhoods <U+2015> to more consistently rely on small donors in their districts. ìThe cityís public financing system gives candidates an incentive to reach out to a broader and more diverse array of constituents to fund their campaigns,î a 2012 study by the Brennan Center and the progressive think tank Demos found.This small-donor matching system has also spread to other states, cities and municipalities. Some matching funds programs have existed for years, but in the past five years, adoption has spread rapidly to Washington, D.C.; Montgomery and Howard counties in Maryland; and Suffolk County, New York, among other places. New York state lawmakers are currently debating the statewide adoption of such a program. ìIf New York City is any guide, it actually changes how candidates raise money,î Norden said. ìSo, right now you have many candidates raising many more contributions than weíve seen in the past raising from small donors. I think we would see even more of a change of going to constituents and small donors as a source of funding rather than the biggest donors.î<U+FEFF>CORRECTION:†A previous version of this story stated that Teresa Mosqueda was the first candidate in the country to run and win using democracy vouchers.

It lacked support from both Republicans and Democrats <U+2015> the latter of whom were not included in the dayís discussions. It also didnít have the backing of President Donald Trump, who shot down the proposal shortly after it was pitched to him by the Senate GOP on Thursday, according to Politico.ìI have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just donít see a pathway forward,î Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and one of the main proponents of the idea, told reporters afterward.†The South Carolina Republican later tweeted that Congress faced a ìcomplete stalemateî over reopening the government, pinning the blame partly on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her fellow Democratsí refusal to give an inch on funding a wall Trump initially promised Mexico would pay for.Itís unclear where talks go from here <U+2015> if any occur at all. Trump on Thursday toured the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas to draw attention to the need for more border security. He also canceled a trip to the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, scheduled for later this month, citing Democratsí ìintransigenceî over the wall.Trump so far has refrained from building a wall via a national emergency declaration, which would free up unidentified Pentagon funds to start its construction. While he maintains that he has the ìabsolute rightî to do so, both Republicans and Democrats believe the move would be challenged in court.ìIf this doesnít work out, I probably will do it, maybe definitely,î Trump told reporters on Thursday before leaving for the border.Some lawmakers believe a presidential emergency declaration could be one way out of the showdown over border wall funding. By making the declaration, the theory goes, Trump could save face with his base by claiming he has begun building the wall and later blame the courts if they block it.ìIt might break an impasse. And it needs to be broken one way or the other. Iíd rather it be broken in negotiations,î Senate Appropriations Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.)†told reporters†about the idea on Thursday.Graham tweeted later on Thursday that he supports a presidential emergency declaration to build the wall. ìI hope it works,î he added.The consequences of the partial government shutdown are mounting <U+2015> for national parks, airports, food inspections, emergency preparations and a host of other services. Additionally, some 800,000 federal workers will start missing paychecks this week.Senate Democrats on Thursday attempted to call up for a vote several bills that would reopen the government, but each time Republicans objected.Democrats are also reportedly threatening to block the Senate from adjourning this week, a move aimed to heighten pressure on the Senate majority leader and further highlight the standoff over the shutdown.ìI would just say three words to my friend the majority leader: Open the government.

The park reopened campgrounds and a number of hiking areas that were closed at the end of December as a result of the government shutdown.With the U.S. government now in the third week of a partial shutdown <U+2015> which†has left 380,000 federal workers furloughed and another 420,000 working without pay <U+2015> Joshua Tree has found itself sorely understaffed and vulnerable to irresponsible visitors.†Spokesman George Land†said in a statement on Tuesday that the park had witnessed ìincidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days.îA temporary closure was set to begin at 8 a.m. local time on Thursday ìto allow park staff to address sanitation, safety, and resource protection issues in the park that have arisen during the lapse in appropriations,î Land said.National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration kept them open during this partial shutdown without funding.Just eight rangers were on hand as of Tuesday to oversee Joshua Treeís sprawling 790,636 acres, Land told the†Los Angeles Times.But on Wednesday, officials said they would be able to use Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to ìbring on additional staff to ensure the protection of park resources and mitigate some of the damage that has occurred during the lapse of appropriations.îOfficials also thanked volunteers who have helped with cleaning and maintenance during the shutdown.ìTheir efforts have contributed significantly to the reopening of campgrounds and restoring access to other closed areas of Joshua Tree National Park,î officials said.†Even with the park largely reopened to the public, some experts warn against visiting Joshua Tree anytime soon to avoid straining the delicate desert ecosystem.Casey Schreiner, a journalist who works to educate people on how to responsibly enjoy the West Coastís natural beauty, said deserts can appear more robust than they are to an untrained eye.ìIf youíre not a desert person, you donít understand how fragile these environments are,î Schreiner said in an interview for The New York Times California Today newsletter.Deserts are home to delicate flora dependent on a fine layer of cryptobiotic soil that, as Schreiner told the Times, ìcan take literally thousands of years to form and can be crushed with a single footprint.î"

Instead, workers are bracing for the next phase of the shutdown as they worry how to pay for gas, rent and food with no income in sight.Now, the effects of the shutdown will get a whole lot worse, the TSA employee union and several officers told HuffPost.ìMorale is, I believe, close to rock bottom, and I think things will start getting really bad if this isnít fixed by this weekend,î one TSA officer told HuffPost, requesting anonymity out of concern over repercussions at work.TSA employees received their last paycheck on Dec. 28, giving them money that would typically last through the next pay period <U+2015> but which will now have to stretch much further. Many TSA workers live paycheck to paycheck, with the starting salary for officers between $25,000 to $30,000 a year. The shutdown has already forced some employees to look for new jobs or take on extra work, TSA staff say, and the pressure is immense for employees and families with no other source of income. ìI donít know how people are going to get to work next week, when we donít get a check,î said Joe Shuker, a regional vice president for the TSA employee union. Shuker says many workers will have to choose between the cost of getting to their job at the airport and covering everyday living expenses. The shutdown is taking an increasing toll on federal workers, adding stress to already difficult work environments such as airport security. As the situation deteriorates at these jobs, some experts warn that it may also increase the risk of corruption at borders, prisons and airports. Meanwhile, the TSA employee union claims that a loss of staff over the shutdown could create a ìmassive security riskî for travelers if the agency is left short-handed.Although TSA officers will very likely receive back pay when the government eventually reopens, that does little to help with their immediate expenses and concerns. Because TSA workers are classified as providing essential services, they must continue to work through the shutdown with no pay coming in and can face disciplinary action for unexplained absences. Already the shutdown has resulted in hundreds of employees calling out of work sick, according to union officials. The TSA has rejected reports of widespread callouts, however, with a representative telling HuffPost that rates are only slightly higher than at this time last year <U+2015> but multiple employees say that they do know of some officers who are calling out due to the shutdown.ìNo one wants to go to work and not get paid, especially for a job like TSA,î another TSA officer told HuffPost, also on the condition of anonymity. The shutdown is now in its 20th day, and there is no sign of a breakthrough in negotiations over President Donald Trumpís demand for $5 billion to fund a border wall with Mexico. On Wednesday, Trump abruptly walked out of a meeting with top Democratic leaders <U+2015> which Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described as ìa temper tantrum because he couldnít get his way.î Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown, often resulting in them scrambling to make rent or even pay for medicine. Federal workers have already held or planned protests in major cities, including one in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, and Shuker expects more to come if the shutdown isnít resolved soon.ìI canít imagine it being a good situation next week, because people are out of money already,î Shuker said.ìWeíve got a lot of dedicated people, man, but sooner or later theyíre gonna break.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I have no doubt about it. I will.îìBut the easy route for me would be to call a national emergency and do it,î Trump added.TRUMP: ""When during the campaign I would say Mexico is going to pay for [the wall], obviously I never meant they are going to write out a check. I said they are are going to pay for it. They are. They are paying for it w/the incredible [unapproved] deal we made called the USMCA."" pic.twitter.com/YVCrSQty2vAlso, Trump falsely claimed that he never said Mexico would directly pay for the wall he is now putting on taxpayers.ìWhen during the campaign I would say Mexico is going to pay for [the wall], obviously I never said this, and I never meant theyíre going to write out a check. I said theyíre going to pay for it. They are. They are paying with the incredible deal we made called the USMCA.îTrump made the same talking point days earlier during his Oval Office address.ìThe wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico,î Trump said Tuesday night in a televised speech. That trade deal,†the United StatesñMexicoñCanada Agreement (USMCA), would replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) but has not been approved by Congress. And with Democrats now in control of the House, it seems unlikely that its ratification will become a top priority anytime soon.I often stated, ìOne way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.î This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!The presidentís pivot is a far cry from what he promised his supporters in his 2016 presidential campaign: that Mexico would directly pay for the construction, either through ìreimbursementî or by deducting costs ìfrom Mexican foreign aid,î among other possible solutions that have not come to fruition.In April 2016 he sent a memo saying Mexico would directly pay.ìItís an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,î the memo read.Our border is being breached daily by criminals. We must build a wall & deduct costs from Mexican foreign aid! http://t.co/jEgR6jSQ5JBut if Trump truly thought Mexico would pay for his wall, he would not have allowed a government shutdown that has left an estimated 800,000 federal workers†furloughed or working without pay after Congress refused to give him†$5 billion from taxpayers for his wall. The shutdown, which has reached its 20th day, has led to the Food and Drug Administration postponing routine checks for food safety and has made air travel less safe as air traffic controllers have worked without pay and safety inspectors have been furloughed. Trump said last week he can ìrelateî to the unpaid workers, but that ìtheyíll make adjustments.îDuring his Thursday morning meltdown, the president also claimed he was ìa professional at technology,î said he didnít slam a table during a failed meeting with Democratic leaders on Wednesday and called Democrats ìcrazy.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He said he has been picking up odd jobs to provide for his seven daughters and wife, who is recovering from cancer.ìIt brings a lot of stress,î Munoz said of the shutdown.He continued: ìA lot of the folks that look up to you in the community look at you like, ëWait, youíre a firefighter. You work for the federal government. Youíre supposed to be in a secure job, a strong profession.í And when they hear that youíre furloughed and youíre not working and youíre possibly asking for loans and extensions on your utilities <U+2015> itís unacceptable.îThe shutdown stalemate focuses on President Donald Trumpís demand for more than $5 billion to build his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall. The president has said he would reject a spending bill to reopen the government that doesnít provide for the wall, which he has promised Mexico would pay for. Democrats have refused his demand.Though federal employees will likely receive retroactive pay, many families are struggling to pay rent and buy necessities in the meantime. Whatís more, government contractors likely never will receive back pay.The shutdown has also jeopardized food security and health care for American Indian tribes, which rely heavily on federal funding to operate under longstanding treaties with the U.S. government. Food assistance benefits for 38 million Americans could run out in March.Both Munoz and Honan agreed the shutdown needs to end immediately for the sake of all Americans.ìI donít know how long financially that our family will be able to hang in there,î Honan told CNN. ìAnd itís not just us <U+2015> many families outside of federal employees are affected by this as well. So just end this now <U+2015> the sooner the better.îH/T†MediaiteDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Instead, the furloughed federal employee will be looking in her mailbox for an unemployment insurance check. ìI should get it this week, hopefully in the next day or so,î said Evans, who lives in Oregon and works for one of the governmentís natural resource agencies.Many federal workers like Evans are about to mark their first expected payday without wages since the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22. As they go longer without pay, more and more are expected to take the step Evans was quick to: file an unemployment claim with their state in order to find a lifeline until the government fully reopens and their pay resumes.Roughly a quarter of government functions are unfunded as President Donald Trump demands Congress approve more than $5 billion for a wall along the southern border that he used to say Mexico would pay for. Some 380,000 federal workers have been furloughed and are off the job, while another 420,000 are continuing to work as ìessentialî personnel but without pay. It would require an act of Congress to retroactively pay both groups of workers once the government reopens, as has typically been done in the past. In the meantime, workers still have mortgage payments to make, credit cards to pay down and groceries to put in their cabinets†without knowing when their next paycheck will arrive.†So far, the number of federal workers and contractors seeking unemployment benefits has been rising but appears to remain small as a share of the overall furloughed workforce. Unemployment agencies said they expect the number of claims to rise in the coming days, if more workers fear the impasse will stretch beyond their savings.The District of Columbia, which has a disproportionate share of federal workers compared with states, had seen 3,745 federal workers and an estimated 822 federal contractors apply for benefits due to the shutdown as of Tuesday night, the D.C. Department of Employment Services told HuffPost. The agency is dealing with the influx of cases by having staff work extended hours. †A total of 1,328 workers in Maryland had applied for unemployment as a result of the shutdown as of Monday night, according to the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. The state has some of the highest concentrations of federal workers in the country.ìIt has been increasing since the start, and like with any extended shutdown, we anticipate that the number of claims will continue to increase,î said Theresa Blaner, an agency spokeswoman.William Walton, the unemployment insurance director for Virginia, said the state has verified only 279 claims as a direct result of the shutdown.ìWe are certainly seeing claims here in Virginia, and we do see them trending upward,î Walton said. ìThe longer the shutdown continues, the more claims we will see.îMany federal workers live paycheck to paycheck, and as HuffPost previously reported, they are buckling down for a long shutdown by maxing out credit cards, looking for interest-free loans and borrowing money from relatives, among other budget-tightening moves.Only workers who are furloughed are eligible for unemployment payments; those who are continuing to work without pay donít qualify since they are still employed. When federal workers are granted backpay after a shutdown, they are required to pay back any unemployment benefits they received. (The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued guidance for federal workers on applying for unemployment.)Workers are entitled to a weekly payment as a percentage of their annual gross pay, though each state has its own cap on benefits. In general, workers are also required to look for jobs as they receive benefits, even though they know they will return to work for the federal government once the president and Congress reach a deal.ìPeople arenít going to get a huge portion of their wages replaced. The average is one-third to half. At least itís something,î said Michele Evermore, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.Evans, who is 66, said the unemployment payments she expects are well under her regular salary. The maximum weekly benefit in Oregon is $624. She estimates that would leave her with a shortfall of about $800 over the course of a full month, relative to her normal wages.She already paid her rent for the month, but soon sheíll have to deal with a car payment and utilities. She has repayments to make on two loans and reached out to her creditors to ask for leniency. With 42 years of service with the government, Evans said she would much rather be doing her work than filling out unemployment forms and applying for jobs she wonít be taking. ìThis sitting idle knowing that you have work to do and want to serve the public <U+2015> weíre going to be further and further behind,î Evans said. ìIím trying not to focus on that. Iím trying to do what I need to do for the unemployment insurance, hunkering down at home and visiting family.î As for whether the benefits will be enough to cover all her bills, she said she doesnít know yet.ìWeíll find out if this goes on a couple more weeks,î she said.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Last month, the administration took a significant step toward opening large swaths of the remote refuge to fossil fuel production, releasing a report that calls for leasing to begin as early as this summer and details potential effects on the unspoiled landscape. The lengthy draft environmental impact statement <U+2015> one of former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeís final acts at the agency <U+2015> explores three alternatives that would make available for lease between 66 percent and 100 percent of the refugeís 1.5 million-acre coastal plain.The Trump administrationís own analysis makes it clear that spills of oil and other substances are not only possible but likely.The Bureau of Land Management report estimates that future development in the refuge could result in up to 1,745 oil spills by 2050, including six ìlargeî events of at least 1,000 gallons. Additionally, the agency concludes that ìthe probability of a spill over 100,000 gallons is low,î noting that ìonly three spillsî of that size were documented on the North Slope from 1985 to 2010. But CAPís review suggests the federal governmentís estimate is far too conservative. The group points to a 2007 report by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation that shows there were an average 448 spills per year on the North Slope from 1995 to 2005, with spills averaging 428 gallons <U+2015> or roughly 10 barrels. And since 2002 there have been 16 large oil spills in Alaska, five of them over 100,000 gallons, according to the Oil Spill Task Force.The arctic refuge, considered one of Alaskaís crown jewels and often described as ìAmericaís Serengeti,î covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska. It is home to polar bears, caribou, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds. For years the refuge has been a battleground between environmentalists and fossil fuel interests. The GOP tax law passed by Congress in late 2017 included a provision, introduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), that requires the Interior Department to approve at least two lease sales for drilling ó each covering no less than 400,000 acres.The Trump administration has prioritized arctic refuge drilling as part of its ìenergy dominanceî agenda. Even amid the current partial government shutdown that has left national parks around the country†damaged†and overflowing with†trash and human waste, the Department of the Interior has found a way to continued that work, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media†reported.†CAPís review suggests the administrationís assessment minimizes the potential harm that energy development would have on wildlife, specifically imperiled polar bears and caribou. Polar bears, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, maintain a constant presence in the refugeís coastal plain, which contains important habitat for pregnant mothers to den and give birth. In its assessment, BLM acknowledges that ìthe potential for injury or mortality [of polar bears] could be high when developing new oil and gas projectsî but provides no estimate of how many bears could be harmed. Seventy-seven percent of the refugeís coastal plain is denning habitat identified as critical for polar bears, although BLM says not all of those acres are suitable for maternal dens. To mitigate potential effects on†bears, surveyors can use infrared technology to spot heat coming from occupied dens. BLM says this technology is ìproven to be an effective means of locating densî but that it does ìnot provide perfect detection and occupied maternal dens are sometimes missed.î In its analysis, CAP points to a review of proposed seismic surveys in the refuge by Steven Amstrup, the chief scientist for Polar Bears International. In 2004, Amstrup evaluated the effectiveness of the infrared technology in spotting dens. His findings suggest that ìa 50 [percent] detection rate is probably close to the highest that could reasonably be expected from a single survey effort,î Amstrup writes in the review.In December, Mother Jones magazine†reported on an internal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service memo in which FWS experts warned the administration about the threat seismic exploration posed to polar bears. To rely on infrared technology to safeguard a species thatís already at risk is highly concerning, Kelly said.CAP also says BLMís assessment fails to accurately detail the amount of water required to support planned energy development, as well as the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. CAP estimates that up to 1.3 billion gallons of water would be needed to drill the oil wells, and then 5.7 billion gallons per year to support oil production. The Trump administration projects that annual greenhouse gas emissions would range from 0.7 million to 5 million metric tons, but CAP pegs the figure at closer to 62 million metric tons <U+2015> equivalent to the annual pollution of 13 million cars.A BLM official told HuffPost on Wednesday that, due to the lapse in appropriations, the department is unable to answer media inquiries unrelated to the ongoing partial government shutdown. An email sent to the Interior Departmentís press office bounced back as undeliverable.Republicans have been working for decades to gain access to the oil and gas below the refugeís coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area. President Donald Trump has said he ìreally didnít careî about opening the refuge to drilling, but then a friend ìwhoís in that world and in that businessî called and told him about the longstanding battle. Murkowski has dismissed the idea that fossil fuel production puts this remote swath of northeast Alaska at risk, saying at a Senate hearing in 2017 that ìthis is not a choice between energy and the environment.îìWe are not asking to develop all of the 1002 Area,î Murkowski said. ìWe are asking for 2,000 acres, about one ten-thousandth of [the refuge].îThe GOP tax law Trump signed in late 2017 allows for the development of 2,000 acres of the coastal plain above ground with well pads and support facilities. That stated surface disturbance is another area where CAP and other conservation groups argue the administration has twisted the truth, saying the 2,000-acre figure excludes potentially hundreds of miles of elevated pipelines and ice roads. ìIf you dig into the details contained in this review, it becomes clear what a huge footprint the oil and gas operation would have,î Kelly said. ìThey are contemplating that exploration and production would last for nearly a century. We are talking about something that impacts future generations quite literally.îPrevious CAP research showed that the purported economic incentive of opening the refuge could be wildly off-base. The Interior Department has said the oil and gas leases would generate an estimated $1.8 billion in federal revenue over a decade, while the Congressional Budget Office has pegged the figure at closer to $1.1 billion. But CAP found that the U.S. government would likely collect only†$37.5 million over 10 years."

But some of their parents are federal employees who now canít take paid leave.Federal workers <U+2015> like many other Americans <U+2015> donít get paid parental leave. But most are covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. They can substitute paid annual leave during that time to take care of the new baby or recover from labor. But during a government shutdown, scheduled paid time off is canceled.New parents who stay home furloughed may be paid retroactively, like other federal employees, if Congress acts.†But the uncertainty about when or if theyíll get paid is putting pressure on families. Employees like Bill Striffler, the head of the local air traffic controllers union in Newark, New Jersey, worry if they stay home, they risk losing paychecks. Striffler and his wife Theresa, are expecting their first child on Friday, Jan. 18. Theresa, who works in sales, is hoping to collect disability pay. In the meantime, Billóconsidered an ìessentialî employee as an air traffic controller at Newark Liberty International Airportóplans to work up until the baby is born. At that point, he was intending to take accrued paid vacation time. But if the shutdown continues, and he takes that time off, it will be considered furlough, or unpaid time, and he doesnít know whether heíll recover the back pay. That could influence how much time he takes, he told HuffPost.ìIf she really needs me home, thatís going to be my priority, and weíll figure out the finances later,î Bill said. ìBut it definitely is going to have impact.î ìI was looking forward to him being able to take a couple weeks off and being paid for that time, but now thereís no guarantee that heíll ever be paid if he does,î Theresa added. ìIt makes the situation scary.îThe partial government shutdown over President Donald Trumpís desired wall on the southwestern border, began Dec. 22 and affects only certain agencies. It has forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees deemed essentialólike those protecting public safetyóto work without pay, while others have been furloughed. They wonít get paid retroactively unless Congress acts, which has happened in past shutdowns, but in the meantime, bills are piling up. From fearing eviction to forgoing Lupus medication, Americans are feeling the effects of the shutdown ripple across their lives.Expecting parents are in a particular lurch. Another employee who works in enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Fort Worth, Texas, and asked not to be named because of concerns about the political climate, was due to have her second child Wednesday. The employee has been saving up paid leave for almost a year in anticipation of having her baby, she told HuffPost on Tuesday, noting that she has approximately 140 paid hours from vacation and 60 paid hours in sick leave. Her paid leave was due to start on Wednesday, but because of the shutdown and her being furloughed, she now wonít be receiving her paycheck, she said.Sheís fortunate, she noted, in that sheíll be able to access her paid leave when the shutdown ends. (Generally, the government also recommends that ìuse or loseî leave†be restored if lost due to a shutdown.)†Her supervisors are very understanding, she added, and her unpaid leave is, of course, protected under the law. But she has had to borrow money from her parents, an option not everyone has, she pointed out. She worries about having to eventually file for unemployment benefits, ìwhich I donít really want to have to do,î she said. Because she was furloughed, she also couldnít work for several days before her maternity leave as planned, she said, which added more stress as she was ìworried about the workload I may have left somebody else.îMany employees represented by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association can use their own paid leave for an uninterrupted period of†up to six months†to care for a new child, said Nick Daniels, the Fort Worth center president for the organization. But if an employee decides to come to work to not be furloughed, this interrupts that time, he said.One of Danielsí co-workers, an air traffic controller in Fort Worth, had a baby less than a week ago, he noted. ìDoes he stay home with his wife and two other children and risk not getting paid, or go to work and at least he knows he will get paid when the governments reopens?î Daniels asked.He called the decision ìexcruciatingî and added that new moms, as well as co-workers with sick children, are facing a similar dilemma. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and others have†backed legislation that would provide retroactive pay to employees impacted by the shutdown at the earliest date possible after the shutdown ends. It would also allow ìexceptedî employees to take leave during a shutdown and be subsequently paid.†But for now, as Trump continues his public relations campaign for $5.7 billion for a barrier along the border, with no end to the shutdown in sight, federal employees and their families will continue to shoulder the burden. ìWith the baby coming, itís scary,î Bill Striffler said. ìItís not what I want to be worried about right nowógetting paid for what Iíve actually been working.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Foreign food inspections have proceeded as normal, and the Department of Agriculture has continued to inspect domestic meat and poultry, the Times reported.The FDA oversees about 80 percent of Americaís food supply and many overseas imports, and helps counter food-borne diseases that send about 128,000 people to the hospital each year, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Just last year, the agency and the CDC helped pinpoint an outbreak of E. coli to romaine lettuce and track breakfast cereal that sickened some people with salmonella.The shutdown has stretched deep into its third week and is on track to become the longest since the 1970s if the government doesnít reopen by Saturday. President Donald Trump has remained steadfast in his demands for $5.7 billion from Congress to construct a border wall and resisted Democratsí efforts to forge a deal to reopen the government without it.On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said the president abruptly walked out of a White House meeting to discuss ending the shutdown, saying Trump threw a ìtemper tantrum because he couldnít get his way.îìA total waste of time,î the president declared of the meeting afterward. ìI said bye-bye, nothing else works!îWhile the FDAís inspections are an important part of American food safety standards, there are tens of thousands of food facilities in the country, and it would be impossible for the agency to inspect all of them every year.ìI think most people agree these inspections are important.

Federal employees are already paid about 32 percent less than private-sector employees for doing the same work, according to the Federal Salary Council. Now, about 380,000 are on furlough while another 420,000 are being pressed into working without pay. And though government employees have received back pay for every previous shutdown, itís not guaranteed that they will this time. And contractors working for the government have never been approved for back pay.President Donald Trump has said heís willing to let the shutdown continue for years if Democrats donít bend to his demands to fund a wall along the U.S. southern border. If youíre one of the Americans affected by the shutdown, thereís no denying itís an incredibly difficult position to be in. However, there might be a few steps you can take to stay afloat.If you were sent home on furlough, the first thing you should do is apply for unemployment benefits. In general, furloughed government employees <U+2015> including contractors <U+2015> are eligible under the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees Program. Eligibility varies by state; you can look up your stateís contact information here. Most states pay out a maximum of 26 weeks of regular benefits.Keep in mind that if you do end up receiving back pay, youíll need to repay your unemployment funds to the state. In most cases, you can take care of it online.Whether youíre furloughed or working without pay, youíll need to determine which bills have to be paid now and which can be put on the back burner.For example, you might want to prioritize payments for utility services such as electricity and gas. However, you should call your service providers and let them know about your situation <U+2015> it might be possible to work out a deal so that your service goes uninterrupted during the shutdown while you defer payments.Another priority should be payments on any collateral loans, such as your home or car, since you could lose them if you fall behind. Plus, your credit will take a hit for any payments late by 30 days or more. Again, you might be able to temporarily pause payments by informing your lenders of the situation (more on that below).Food is another major expense that you canít simply eliminate from your budget. However, there may be community programs you can take advantage of from food banks and churches. As of now, the federal Women, Infant and Children nutritional assistance program can be utilized by those who might temporarily qualify for it during the shutdown. But WIC also may have to stop its operations if the funding standoff drags on through February.As for other expenses, consider freezing or cutting off services that arenít essential, such as cable or streaming services, gym memberships, internet, cell phone data, etc.If you have outstanding debt, your lenders may be willing to work with you during the shutdown. Call your lenders, explain your situation and ask about any financial hardship programs. Some lenders might temporarily modify the loan or allow you to defer payments.The federal Office of Personnel Management provides letter templates you can send to creditors, lenders and landlords to inform them of your employment and income status during the shutdown and document the terms of any changes to your payments. However, OPM suggests speaking with letter recipients first, since it may take some time for them to see your correspondence. You should also make sure you have all the necessary information in your letter, including contact information and account numbers. Keep copies for your records.You might have started off the shutdown with existing credit card debt, or racked up a balance trying to keep up with expenses since the shutdown began. Either way, those payments are one more cost itís tough to cover with no income. And if youíre only able to make the minimum payments, credit card interest will add up fast.Try asking your card issuer about extended grace periods or a temporary reduction in the minimum payment. Alternatively, you might want to try a fairly simple solution if your credit is in decent shape: Perform a balance transfer.Credit card companies will often entice new customers by offering promotional interest rates on balances transferred from competitors. If you can qualify for a balance transfer credit card, you can enjoy 0 percent APR on that balance for about 12 months in most cases <U+2015> maybe longer. Usually, there is a balance transfer fee of around 3 to 5 percent, but that is likely worth the interest savings.The longer you go without pay, the more difficult it is to stay on top of basic living expenses. But unless youíre able to score a 0 percent APR deal, adding to your credit card debt will probably create a bigger mess for you to deal with later.Fortunately, many banks and credit unions across the country are offering low-interest loans to borrowers affected by the shutdown. For instance, Launch Federal Credit Union is offering 12-month loans of up to $3,000 at 0 percent interest. Navy Federal Credit Union is also offering interest-free loans of up to $6,000.If you need to borrow money to make ends meet, this could be a more affordable way to do it. Contact your local banks and credit unions to find out what options you have.Money, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPost"

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), aims to give those workers a helping hand while the government remains shuttered.The bill would prohibit landlords and creditors from taking action against federal workers or contractors who are hurt by the shutdown and cannot pay rent or repay loans. It would also allow federal workers to sue creditors or landlords that violate those protections, which would remain in effect during and for 30 days after a shutdown.The bill is modeled after the Servicemembers Relief Act of 1940, which protects military members from being sued while in active service for their country and for up to a year after active duty.The new proposal ìprevents eviction, foreclosure, repossession, and loss of insurance. It basically allows any federal worker or contractor who is behind on monthly expenses to have relief until the government is reopened,î Schatz told HuffPost on Wednesday.The bill has broad support from Democrats in the House and Senate, but no Republican co-sponsors <U+2015> yet. Schatz said he hoped to get at least a few of them on board.Some banks have already moved to forgive late payments and service fees from furloughed federal workers, including Wells Fargo, Chase and Capital One.Over the weekend, Trump told reporters†that he could empathize with those who arenít getting paid as a result of the shutdown.ìI can relate,î he said on Sunday. ìAnd Iím sure that the people that are toward the receiving end will make adjustments, they always do. And theyíll make adjustments. People understand exactly whatís going on.îìMany of those people that wonít be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what Iím doing,î the president added without evidence.Trump later encouraged landlords and lenders to ìbe nice and easyî to furloughed workers.UPDATE: Jan. 10 <U+2015>† Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Thursday that while he had not yet seen Schatzís proposal, he welcomed the concept of legal protections for furloughed federal workers.ìI certainly support the idea that we should be protecting them. I feel terrible for them. Itís not their fault. Theyíre caught in the crosshairs of something that has nothing to do with them and itís unfair,î Rubio told HuffPost.†Arthur Delaney contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are wondering when they might see their next paycheck.Chapin Fay, a former National Republican Congressional Committee aide, joined Fox Newsí ìThe Daily Briefingî on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or, if deemed essential, working without pay.Though these workers will likely receive retroactive pay after the government reopens, some are struggling to pay rent or buy groceries in the interim. Whatís more, government contractors likely will not receive back pay.But Fay didnít seem too concerned with their plight on Wednesday,†even suggesting he would welcome additional shutdowns in the future.ìTrump is winning the shutdown showdown because heís made it all about immigration, the wall, national security <U+2015> these are things that motivate his base,î Fay told Fox News.†ìI just donít think that the average American is motivated yet about shutdown politics.îHe added,†ìI think actually some of us wonder if the government shouldnít be shut down more often.îHost Dana Perino laughed off Fayís insensitive suggestion: ìWell, okay, well we could try that.îAsked later to clarify his remarks, Fay told HuffPost:†ìI have sympathy for the federal workers not getting paid as Iíve been a government employee at the municipal, state and federal levels. But the size and scope of government is out of control and the country would be better off with less government not more.îThe shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, has affected several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department. Without staffing, national parks like Yosemite in California and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado are being overwhelmed with trash and vandalism.The Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that Americans who receive food assistance will still get benefits for February even if the shutdown continues, though the agency did not make any promises about March.†Suspending benefits, which is what would apparently happen if the shutdown continues past March, would have serious economic consequences <U+2015> and create a lot more hunger for the nationís 38 million Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program enrollees.Watch Fay deliver his head-scratching proposal around the 21:50 mark below:This article has been updated to include Fayís comment to HuffPost."

This month, they do. The difference between then and now is that Trump has wholeheartedly embraced the concept of shutting down parts of the federal government to force congressional Democrats to support funding for the wall. The reversal suggests that a funding bill similar to last monthís could pass in this Congress, too, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to allow a vote on any spending bill that does not have the support of the president. Itís possible a bill to reopen the government could pass with enough support to override a presidential veto. But Republicans suggested Wednesday they wouldnít dare.ìIím going to defer to the president on the best strategy and I would never vote to override a veto on something that the president didnít think was the best approach,î Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost while carrying a lapdog named Mitch to McConnellís office on Wednesday. Fun meeting Mitch Tillis, the newest addition to the Tillis family! #mitchmeetmitch pic.twitter.com/0g41vfh9ktOther Republicans scoffed at the prospect of overriding a veto. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, called the prospect of 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in bucking Trump over the wall ìa waste of time,î adding that it would ìnever happen.î†But if this Congress worked as the founders intended <U+2015> as a branch of government that is equal to the White House <U+2015> lawmakers could at least be given a chance to vote on a bill to reopen the government <U+2015> especially one they already passed less than a month ago.ìThe Constitution doesnít make Congress subservient to the president,î Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. ìNo one here has to follow the order of President Trump, especially when heís doing something bad for the country.î†The funding bill that the Senate passed in December <U+2015> which would have kept the government operating until February but did not include any wall money <U+2015> passed easily, without a roll call vote, meaning zero out of 100 senators opposed it strongly enough to demand a roll call. Any Republican senator currently repeating the Trump administrationís line about a ìcrisisî on the U.S.-Mexico border could have forced a recorded vote on the measure over its lack of border security funding, but none did.†Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) said Wednesday that he was one of two senators who said ìnoî to the December funding bill on the Senate floor during the voice vote. The Appropriations Committee member did so, he said, because of a general objection to funding government via a short-term ìcontinuing resolutionî <U+2015> not the fact that it contained no funds for Trumpís wall.ìI keep telling myself Iím never voting for a CR again,î Moran told HuffPost. Before the Senate agreed to the resolution, McConnell said Republicans would ìfulfill our duty to governî even though Democrats were being intransigent about funding Trumpís border wall (which, after all, the president had previously said would be funded by Mexico, not Congress). But then the House of Representatives, which was still under Republican control at the time, refused to hold a vote on the Senate bill because Trump had belatedly decided he opposed it, contrary to previous signals from the White House. The new Democratic House has approved funding but couldnít send the previously passed Senate measure to the president without the Senate passing it again. †The government has been shut down since Dec. 21, and the consequences are mounting. A range of services, including trash pickup in national parks, have ceased. This week, some 800,000 federal workers will start missing paychecks. The Internal Revenue Service announced an ad hoc plan to pay tax refunds, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it could pay food benefits for February but not necessarily March. Trump repeated Wednesday that the shutdown could continue ìfor as long as it takes,î raising the possibility that his push for a border wall could result in mass hunger for the 38 million Americans who currently receive food benefits each month. †Nevertheless, a funding bill that didnít include money for Trumpís wall would not succeed now, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.ìWhat we need is a negotiated outcome, not trying to vanquish your political foes, which is the exercise weíre engaged in right now,î Cornyn said. HuffPost pointed out to Cornyn that Congress and the White House are coequal branches of government and that lawmakers could override a presidential veto. ìWith 67 votes,î Cornyn said, implying that the higher vote threshold for a veto override would be unreachable. While presidential veto overrides are rare, they have occurred many times in history. Most recently, Congress voted overwhelmingly to override President Barack Obamaís veto of a bill that allowed families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-V.t.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, predicted that a bill funding the government that did not include money for a wall would pass ìoverwhelminglyî if it was allowed to come to the floor.ìEvery Republican will tell you that privately,î Leahy told HuffPost on Wednesday.Still, there are no signs that Republican leaders are planning on backing down. Trump visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to reassure uneasy rank-and-file members and urge them to stand firm as the shutdown barrels toward its fourth week. Several moderates <U+2015> including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado <U+2015> have called for votes to reopen most of the government without a resolution on the wall funding.But some of the presidentís biggest allies in Congress say the issue of the wall is a life-and-death situation for the Trump administration <U+2015> and maybe even the Republican Party writ large.ìIf we undercut the president, thatís the end of his presidency and the end of our party,î Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday in an interview on Fox News.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Nancy said, NO,î the president tweeted.Trump has made his proposed border wall the sole focus of the shutdown: Unless he can secure some $5 billion for the project, he will not agree to any budget proposal that would fully reopen the government.He continued: ìI said bye-bye, nothing else works.îJust left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!Schumer confirmed Trumpís version of events, telling reporters gathered in front of the White House, ìWell, unfortunately the president just got up and walked outî after Pelosi said she would not agree to funding for the wall.†ìHe just got up and he said, ëThen we have nothing to discuss.í And he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldnít get his way,î Schumer said.According to a source familiar with the meeting, the Senate minority leader had confronted Trump in the situation room about the human cost of the partial shutdown, which has left some federal employees with diminishing means to pay for basic necessities.†ìYouíre using people as leverage. Why wonít you open the government and stop hurting people?î Schumer said.According to the source, Trump replied:†ìBecause then you wonít give me what I want.îOutside the White House, Pelosi echoed Schumerís message, telling reporters that she did not believe Trump fully appreciated the financial impact on the federal workers who have been showing up to work without getting paid, or who have not been able to work at all since the shutdown began just before Christmas.†ìThe president seems to be insensitive to that. He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money,î Pelosi said. ìBut they canít.îìIf you donít understand financial insecurity, then you would have a policy that takes pride in saying, ëIím going to keep the government shut down for months or years unless you totally agree to my position,íî she said.Asked whether the president acted out of anger, as alleged by Schumer, Vice President Mike Pence said he remembered Trump behaving calmly.†ìThe president walked into the room and passed out candy. I donít recall him ever raising his voice or slamming his hand,î Pence said.†The vice president told reporters that the Democratic leaders also objected to Trumpís characterization of the situation at the southern border, which Pence referred to as ìa humanitarian and security crisis.î†Pelosi, Pence said, ìbegan to argue whether we even had a crisis or whether facts are true.î†The Trump administration <U+2015> including the vice president <U+2015> has invited sharp criticism this week for its numerous†misleading claims about what is happening on the U.S. border with Mexico to justify the proposed wall. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed in a Sunday interview on ìFox News Sundayî that 4,000 ìknown or suspected terroristsî had come into the U.S. illegally, prompting host Chris Wallace to fact-check her; the figure stemmed from people captured at airports. Pence cited the same misleading statistic in a Tuesday morning interview with ìGood Morning America.î†In his Tuesday evening address to the nation, Trump repeated many of the same lies and half-truths he has long told in regard to the wall, falsely claiming that Democrats want ìopen bordersî and painting the migrants arriving at the border to seek asylum as dangerous criminals.†Hayley Miller contributed reporting.

Roy Cooper (D) on Wednesday implored President Donald Trump to end the partial government shutdown in order to unlock funds meant to help the battered state recover from a destructive hurricane season.The shutdown, which began Dec. 22, poses a significant risk to North Carolinaís farming economy and its ability to rebuild after deadly Hurricane Florence pummeled the state in September, Cooper wrote in a letter to the president.ìThe people of North Carolina are strong and are working hard to rebuild,î Cooper wrote. ìBut we are equally determined to hold the federal government to its promise of help.îìDuring your visit following Hurricane Florence, you promised me the 100 percent support of the federal government in North Carolinaís recovery,î the letter continued. ìThis shutdown makes that promise harder to keep. Please work with Congressional leaders to end this shutdown so our communities can rebuild quickly and effectively.î†Florence left 41 people dead in North Carolina and dumped an estimated 8 trillion gallons of water, flooding homes and businesses across the state. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in September designated $1.68 billion for states impacted by 2018 storms, but hasnít notified those states about how much funding they will receive, Cooper wrote.Additionally, HUD awarded North Carolina $168 million last April to make the stateís flood-prone areas safer, but the state is unable to use those funds until guidance is published in the Federal Register, which cannot happen during a shutdown, the governor added.ìThe government shutdown is also threatening the livelihood of our farmers, many of whom were swamped by the same hurricane waters that destroyed homes and businesses,î Cooper wrote.†ìHelp from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for hurricane affected farms is unavailable, and farmers hoping to plan for this yearís planting season are running out of time.îNorth Carolina farmers and livestock producers suffered an estimated $1.1 billion in losses due to Florence, which killed at least 5,500 hogs and 4.1 million chickens and turkeys,†the stateís Department of Agriculture announced in September.†The weekslong budget impasse centers on Trumpís demand for $5 billion to build his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Several agencies, including the USDA and the Department of Homeland Security, have been affected by the shutdown. About 800,000 federal workers across the country have been furloughed or, if deemed essential, continue to work without pay.The White House did not immediately respond to HuffPostís request for comment.Read Cooperís letter to Trump below:Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

On Jan. 1, former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan took over as acting secretary at the Department of Defense after Secretary James Mattisí abrupt resignation. The next day, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist and No. 2 at the Department of the Interior, became acting secretary when the agencyís boss, Ryan Zinke, stepped down amid mounting ethics probes.†Wheelerís promotion was expected. Trump announced plans to nominate Wheeler to the job in November. Wheeler, the former deputy administrator, told The New York Times that month that he felt he was ìmaking a difference.î†ìThis is a transitional time for the agency,î he said. ìWeíve started a number of initiatives that Iíd like to see through to conclusion.îWheeler took over the agency six months ago when scandal-plagued former Administrator†Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace. Close allies of Pruitt, including Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), swiftly touted Wheeler as an adequate replacement who would reliably carry out Trumpís pro-fossil-fuel agenda.†Wheeler delivered. In August, he proposed gutting fuel economy standards for new vehicles in a move seen as a ìgiant giveawayî to oil companies even as electric automobile technology made historic leaps forward. Weeks later, he unveiled a rule to weaken a landmark Obama-era power plant regulation, allowing by the EPAís own calculus enough pollution to cause an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.††In November, when scientists at 13 federal agencies, including the EPA, determined in the annual National Climate Assessment that global warming was rapidly worsening,†Wheeler responded by threatening to intervene in the next reportís drafting.†In December, Wheeler handed two more victories to the coal industry that paid him to lobby until mid-2017. In the first week of the month, he proposed softening a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. By the end of the month, he announced plans to relax a rule restricting how much mercury and other dangerous pollutants coal-fired plants can release into the air.††Installing Wheeler as the nationís 15th EPA chief is a formality. Last month, Wheeler became the longest-serving acting administrator in the EPAís 48-year history, surpassing Bob Perciasepeís roughly five-month stint as acting administrator in 2013. Acting rules for the EPA are vague and have generally gone unchallenged, and some argued Wheeler†could have remained in his current role for the rest of Trumpís first term.Yet with a Republican majority in the Senate, Wheeler seems likely to win confirmation.†His nomination to serve as Pruittís No. 2 faced little opposition. Democrats largely overlooked him during the initial confirmation hearing in November 2017. He couched blatant climate change denial in smooth legalese. He appeared moderate next to Kathleen Hartnett White, the right-wing ideologue nominated to serve as the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, whose humiliating performance captured Democratsí attention at the confirmation hearing she shared with Wheeler.†Wheelerís nomination finally came up for a vote in the Senate last April as allegations against Pruitt began to surface. Ahead of the vote, at least one Democratic senator warned that the process seemed ìlike a shadow confirmation vote for the next administrator of the EPA.î Yet every Republican and three Democrats in the Senate†<U+2015> more support than Pruitt himself received in his confirmation vote <U+2015> confirmed him as Pruittís No. 2.Republican challengers unseated two of those Democrats, and the remaining one,†Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), is expected to support Wheeler again.Wheeler has faced his own controversies. As HuffPost reported in October, the agency chief repeatedly engaged with incendiary, partisan content on his personal Facebook and Twitter accounts over the past five years. The online activity included liking a racist image of former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama on Facebook and retweeting an infamous ìPizzagateî conspiracy theorist. At least two Democratic senators called on him to resign.†In early February last year, The Intercept†reported that Wheeler held fundraisers for Sens.

It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!îThere was no further information on the veracity of Trumpís Twitter claim. The White House and FEMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. FEMA is also impacted by the ongoing partial government shutdown and, as Washington Post reporter Damian Paletta highlighted, doesnít have money to send to the state.The announcement comes as California reels from one of its worst wildfire seasons on record.†The Mendocino Complex fire, the largest wildfire in the stateís recorded history,†burned more than 450,000 acres north of Santa Rosa in July. Novemberís Camp fire <U+2015> the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californiaís history ó engulfed more than 153,000 acres, destroyed nearly 19,000 structures and killed at least 86 people.Trump has blamed the stateís devastating infernos on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent water shortage†resulting from ìbad environmental laws.î And the administration has used the disasters to push partisan policy,†connecting the blazes to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources.But the reality is that the federal government manages more land in California than the state. And many of the stateís worst fires have burned primarily federal lands, as the Redding Record Searchlight reported.Last month, Trump signed an executive order†to boost logging and forest thinning on more than 4 million acres of federal lands to combat extreme wildfires.†The order directs the Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture to identify ways to reduce ìregulatory barriersî to better manage forests and get rid of hazardous fuels, and it calls for ìtreatingî 4.25 million federal acres ó an area larger than Connecticut ó to cut fuel loads.Newly inaugurated California Gov. Gavin Newsom†(D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) were among the state leaders that swung back at Trumpís announcement.ìDisasters and recovery are no time for politics,î wrote Newsom, who on Tuesday announced an interstate partnership and a pair of executive orders to combat the wildfire problem.†ìIím already taking action to modernize and manage our forests and emergency responses,î he added in a post to Twitter. ìThe people of CA <U+2015> folks in Paradise <U+2015> should not be victims to partisan bickering.îìWe should work together to mitigate these fires by combating climate change, not play politics by threatening to withhold money from survivors of a deadly natural disaster,î Harris wrote in her own post.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Our last paycheck was near the end of December, and went to cover our mortgage, electric bill, car note, insurance, cable and internet, cellphone bill, and medications. I paid everything at once, not knowing when this shutdown would end and when we would get another paycheck. We are a one-income family <U+2015> my husbandís paycheck.My husband, whose identity I am keeping hidden for fear of agency retribution or loss of his job, is an essential government employee, which, unlike furloughed employees, means he must go to work or lose his job. But, like furloughed workers, he is not getting paid. It will depend on Congress whether he eventually receives back pay. His job helps ensure the safety of the flying public. He manages resources (flight data and radar systems) for the air traffic controllers, which can be a stressful operation if one of the systems breaks or goes offline.During this shutdown, he has worked every day since New Yearís, and will not have a scheduled day off for four more days. He also has been pulling overtime occasionally, as there are not enough workers to man the systems.Each day this shutdown continues, he and his co-workers become more nervous. One co-worker has three sons and is worried about feeding them. Another is worried about paying her daughterís college tuition. Some of his co-workers said they were running out of money entirely and will soon have to figure out how to get to work, since they wonít be able to afford gas. They are paying for school, mortgages, groceries, light bills and other everyday things, and are not receiving a paycheck. This cannot hold.My husband has diabetes. I have asthma, severe allergies that require three medications, and anxiety and depression. We have been stretching the budget as far as possible; weíve canceled doctor appointments, suspended IRA contributions, shopped our freezer and pantry, have not been able to pay our $500 homeowner association fees, did not renew our Costco membership, and kept the heat very low and the lights off for most of the day to save on our electric bill. We are responsible people. We have never been frivolous or spendthrifts. We drive newer used cars, buy generic brands, cook our meals at home, havenít had a vacation in years, and always buy things on sale. We live in a modest house. We save for retirement, pay our bills, and add to our savings when we can. But when youíve spent $15,000 on a new roof that needed to be torn down to the decking after Hurricane Harvey and you had to put in new floors, savings are pretty much depleted. I check our bank account and the budget every few days to see how long we can go without a paycheck. We have enough money to last into February, but after that, we are in serious trouble. The money we do have can only pay for bills, groceries, and essentials like that cat litter. If we have an emergency ó a car breaks down, an illness, hospitalization, anything, really ó what money we do have will be in jeopardy. I have tremendous gratitude for help weíve received, like a few gift cards for Amazon and Walmart, which went to buy one of my allergy medications, toothpaste, rice, my husbandís NescafÈ, and cat food.We try to offer thanksgivings for any money in the bank, a roof over our head, food on the table, a bed to sleep in, and central heating, and we pray a lot that this ends, soon. However, we have little faith that the president understands the plight that we and 800,000 other government workers are in ó the serious and real decisions about food, shelter, lights, gas that are being made right now.Even friends, family members and, of course, internet trolls, have voiced their opinions on how ìthese peopleî (federal employees) should have prepared better, saved three monthsí expenses ìbecause Dave Ramsey says thatís what you should do.î Iíve also heard from people that itís basically a vacation, right? But Iím not quite sure what vacation one would go on that has them worrying about paying for toilet paper, food, medication and electricity. And no federal worker whom I or my husband has spoken with wants to trade their paycheck for a wall.This situation demonstrates the impact that this political fight has on working families in America. American workers should not be held hostage to any political whim or budgetary fight. When 800,000 government employees, including us, who have worked hard and given their lives to make this country a safer and better place are either forced out of their job or, like my husband, forced to work without a paycheck, this highlights the glaring divide between the economic class structures in this country and the quick descent of class mobility.This must end.

The loss of officers, while weíre already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we donít have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires.îLast week, AFGE launched a lawsuit against the federal government for forcing federal employees to show up to work uncompensated, calling the demands ìinhumane.î†Around that time, the union said TSA agents were starting to skip work.

Jay Inslee (D) signed a pledge Tuesday promising to reject donations from the fossil fuel industry ahead of a likely run for the White House that heís vowed to uniquely center on climate change. In an interview with HuffPost, Inslee, 67, said he added his name to the list of more than 1,300 politicians across the United States who took the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge. The vow, administered by a coalition of 16 left-leaning environmental groups, commits candidates to ìadopt a policy to not knowingly accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives, or front groups of fossil fuel companies ó companies whose primary business is the extraction, processing, distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal.îìThis is just one small statement that they should not continue to have undue influence over our decision-making over the existential threat against our nation,î Inslee said by phone Tuesday night. ìThis challenge calls for the scale of national effort similar to when we went to the moon, similar to when we beat fascism.î Inslee is the second governor to sign the pledge, following newly elected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who was sworn in this week, took a similar pledge <U+2015> called Oil Money Out <U+2015> but the oath was limited to the oil industry in the Golden State. But Inslee is the third likely contender for the next Democratic presidential nomination to take the pledge, after Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).ìThe Democratic Party has to put a candidate forward who will make it the primary commitment to get this stuff done,î Inslee said. ìIt canít be put in just one of the baskets of many issues.î By signing, Inslee is laying the groundwork for a historic, if long-shot, bid for the presidency on the single issue of scaling back planet-warming emissions and preparing for climate change. The move is bold but timely. Record-breaking storms, droughts and wildfires wreaked havoc across the U.S. over the past three years as President Donald Trump attempted to boost the fossil fuel industry by gutting or delaying nearly every major federal climate regulation. Even amid a three-week partial government shutdown leaving federal workers scrambling for pay, the Trump administration is continuing to approve oil and gas drilling permits, Bloomberg reported.†In October, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning, giving world governments a 2030 deadline to halve emissions or face a cataclysmic temperature spike. Yet emissions hit an all-time high last year and look set to continue soaring as new estimates released Tuesday showed a 3.4 percent surge in the United States alone. A new generation of left-wing Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), ran as champions of a Green New Deal, a sweeping federal policy to end fossil fuel use and guarantee high-wage clean-energy sector jobs to every American. Itís a popular idea. One poll released last month pegged the number of registered voters who support a Green New Deal at 81 percent, including 57 percent of conservative Republicans.Yet only some of the high-profile Democrats hoping to challenge Trump in 2020 have made the issue a top priority. Sanders held a town hall†on climate change in December and is preparing legislation on a Green New Deal. Merkley was the first senator to back a Green New Deal last year. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) followed soon after, explicitly tying his push for a federal job guarantee to the climate proposal.Former Rep. Beto OíRourke (D-Texas) and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) voiced tepid support for the concept of a Green New Deal.ìThe pledge, even more than the Green New Deal, represents a true litmus test for serious climate action in 2020 and beyond,î R.L. Miller, the president of the political action committee Climate Hawks Vote, said by email of Insleeís announcement. ìOur democracy is being drowned in a dark oily tidal wave of dirty money and it needs leaders who can rise above.îInslee stands alone as the first candidate to say climate change takes priority over other hot-button issues like health care, immigration and inequality. ìThe political capital that needs to be invested, the intense gathering of allies to push this through Congress, just requires an all-out effort,î Inslee said. ìThatís not going to be done just because somebody now decides theyíre interested in climate change. It takes someone whoís frankly cared about it for years and years.î Inslee boasts a lengthy record on climate. In 2006, Inslee, then one of Washingtonís 10 U.S. representatives, spearheaded an effort to set a renewable portfolio standard in the Evergreen State. In 2007, he co-authored a book called Apolloís Fire: Igniting Americaís Clean Energy Economy, which, as the title implies, laid out a vision for bolstering the renewable-energy and electric-vehicle industries. In 2009, he co-founded the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition in the House of Representatives. Later that year, he sponsored the federal cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey. Since he was first elected governor in 2012, Inslee repeatedly championed incentives for electric vehicles, with the goal of getting 50,000 on Washington state roads by 2020. In 2016, he became the first governor to issue an executive order capping carbon dioxide emissions. A glowing profile published last week in The Atlantic credited Inslee with pursuing ìarguably the most progressive and greenest agenda in the country, with fields of solar panels, fleets of electric buses, and massive job growth to show for it.îIn just the past year, Inslee kiboshed two major fossil fuel projects and added new regulations on existing infrastructure. Last January, he personally intervened to reject permits to build what would have been the nationís largest oil-by-rail facility at the Port of Vancouver. He signed a bill in March putting a new tax on pipelines, forcing the operators to fund a state program to protect against oil spills. In May, he blocked construction of a $680 million coal-export terminal on the Columbia River.ìThis is the 11th hour,î Inslee said of the time thatís left to halt catastrophic global warming. ìBut it should be our hour to shine.îInslee fought over the past year to pass Initiative 1631, a ballot measure that would have put a $15 per metric ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions and directed the money toward expanding public transit, energy-efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind- and solar-powered plants. The proposal, dubbed by some a state-level Green New Deal, failed after the oil industry spent a record $31 million pressuring Evergreen State voters to reject the measure. It was Insleeís third attempt at putting a price on carbon in his state.But Inslee said heís not wedded to a carbon pricing scheme as the central focus of a climate policy. Carbon taxes are gaining favor among Republicans and oil companies. But a new gas tax triggered fiery protests in France and became a rallying cry over the past few months against carbon taxes that donít directly benefit low- and middle-income workers.ìPeople have focused on this issue of a carbon tax, but it may not be necessaryî to finance renewable energy infrastructure, Inslee said. ìWe may find other ways to finance this. You look at the Trump tax cuts that were misbegotten and gave all these tax benefits to the upper-income groups, and people werenít worried about the deficit when they did that.î Inslee faces some critics on climate change. In February, 13 young people in Washington, ages seven to 17, sued the state, alleging Inslee and the agencies under his control violated the constitutional rights of a generation by failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions. One plaintiff <U+2015> Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old activist in Seattle who founded the youth climate group Zero Hour <U+2015> railed against Inslee in a series of tweets last week accusing the governor of fighting ìtooth & nailî against the lawsuit, which a state judge tossed in August. Margolin called Inslee†ìan old corperate [sic] establishment white man who screws over the youth and indigenous folks of his state.î She pointed to the ongoing fight over a massive liquefied natural gas terminal in Tacoma, Washington, which the Puyallup Tribe and leaders from 14 other Northwest tribes pleaded with Inslee to reject. Asked about the accusations on Tuesday, Inslee said the Tacoma facility had already begun permitting and that his administration was ìgoing to follow the lawî and allow the process to play out, though he said he requested additional carbon dioxide analyses of the project. ìI cannot make statements about eventual permitting until that plays out,î he said. In a follow-up email, Insleeís spokesman reiterated that the project ìdoesnít have final permitting yet.î Earlier this year, Inslee visited the scorched remains of Paradise, California, a town decimated by the stateís deadliest wildfire in history. He said that visit made clear to him that the 2020 election needed to be singularly focused on the crisis at hand. ìIt looked like Dresden after World War II,î Inslee said. ìIn my final days, when I look back and ask what I did to deal with climate change, I want to be able to say I did everything I could, including possibly running for president.î Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in America, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the presidentís speech below.ìThe wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.îAfter abandoning his campaign pledge that Mexico would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, Trump has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised North American Free Trade Agreement. However, both economists and trade experts have said that wonít be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasnít been approved by Congress yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for Americans. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and itíll be American taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward.ìOur southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.îMore than 90 percent of heroin sold in the United States does come from Mexico, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a ìsmall percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,î the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a report last year.Fentanyl, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into the United States through packages mailed from China and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to The New York Times.Trump also said illicit drugs cost the U.S. some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the presidentís figure, or $193 billion.ìLast month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.îCustoms and Border Protection reported in November that a little more than 20,000 ìfamily unitsî were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives.ìDemocrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.îìThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.îTrump accused Democrats in Congress of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, Democrats offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.During a meeting with Trump in December, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked Trump if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.In that same meeting, Trump maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didnít get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday nightís address where he solely blamed Democrats for the shutdown.ìYes, if we donít get what we want, one way or the other ó whether itís through you, through a military, through anything you want to call ó I will shut down the government. Absolutely,î Trump said in December.He added: ìI am proud to shut down the government for border security.îìSen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,î Trump said. ìThey changed their mind only after I was elected president.îSchumer did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, but that fence pales in comparison to the ìbig, beautifulî 30-foot concrete wall that Trump promised his supporters. In 2006, Schumer, along with then-Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and 22 other Democrats, voted for the Secure Fence Act, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.Trumpís plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but hereís what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an ìimpassable physical barrier,î which Trump first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to ìsteel slats.î Heís also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.As Trump pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence. ìItís not a fence,î Trump said in a tweet addressed to Jeb Bush. ìItís a WALL, and thereís a BIG difference!îìIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we donít act right now.îThe statistics that Trump uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are. According to ICEís year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges <U+2015> but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As the Washington Postís Salvador Rizzo pointed out, ìIn many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.î†ìAt the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.îThe reality: Democrats donít want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown.ìThe fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,î Pelosi said in the Democratsí rebuttal speech. ìWe can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.îìMake no mistake: Democrats and the president both want stronger border security,î Schumer added. ìHowever, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

You know he is scripted.îFurther dismissing Trumpís remarks, Navarro argued that ìthe majority of the American people have now come to understand that this is a lying president.îìHe lied today,î she said. ìItís not inaccuracies, itís not facts and alternative facts. It is downright lies to try to make a political point.îTrumpís speech quickly became the subject of controversy for its series of misleading statements and falsehoods, the first of which occurred in his opening line. According to†Washington Post journalist Salvador Rizzo, Trumpís assertion of a ìsecurity crisis at the southern borderî didnít hold water given that the number of attempted illegal border crossings had hit an almost 20-year low.The primetime speech was part of the presidentís push for more than $5 billion in border wall funding amid a partial government shutdown that has now entered its third week.(h/t RawStory)Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called climate change ìthe biggest crisis of allî in a fiery rebuke of President Donald Trumpís televised address Tuesday night meant to drum up support for funding a U.S.-Mexico border wall to reopen the federal government. Speaking shortly after Trumpís prime-time Oval Office speech, Sanders listed the 30 million Americans without health insurance, the millions of senior citizens in ìdesperate povertyî and the 40 million young Americans ìtrying to deal with outrageous debtî as issues meriting a White House declaration of a national emergency. But the Vermont senator and likely 2020 presidential candidate said human-caused global warming should top the presidentís priorities. ìThe scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet,î Sanders said. ìThey have told us in no uncertain terms that if we do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, our nation and our planet and the planet we will be leaving our kids and grandchildren may well become unhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not-so-distant future.î He added: ìMr. President, we donít need to create artificial crises, we have enough real crises.îThe clarion call capped off Sandersí roughly nine-minute response and stood in stark contrast to the humdrum address the two top Democrats in Congress gave immediately after Trumpís speech. In a response aired on nearly every major network, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the president of using ìthe backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administrationî and of ìholding hostage critical services for the health, safety and wellbeing of the American people.î They made no mention of climate change.The two Democratic leaders, who were standing soberly side by side, drew mockery for appearing like two proverbial parents expressing disappointment with a misbehaving teen. If that official Democratic response was meant to demonstrate the poise and civility that plays well with the Beltway crowd, Sandersí seemed targeted at average American voters. He opened with a list of people victimized by the three-week shutdown of the federal government, including ìthe disabled, their children and the elderlyî on food stamps, small businesses and farmers owed financial assistance, and would-be homeowners or sellers awaiting the processing of mortgage applications. (He didnít mention, however, that the Trump administration has continued processing oil and gas drilling permits, according to Bloomberg.)Then, Sanders recalled the Senate bill to fund the government that passed unanimously on Dec. 19 and said it was ìwidely expectedî that the next day, ìthe House would do the sameî and ìthe government would remain open.î ìUnfortunately, President Trump, who started receiving criticism from an assortment of right-wing ideologues, changed his mind about the agreement,î Sanders said. He then read aloud quotes in which Trump said he is ìproud to shut down the government.î ìIn terms of the shutdown, President Trump has made it very clear who was responsible,î Sanders said.In the middle of his speech, Sanders called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly, saying, ìletís vote to end the shutdown now in a bipartisan way.îìIt gives me no pleasure to tell you what most of you already know, and that is that President Trump lies all of the time,î Sanders said, his voice rising. ìIn his remarks tonight and in recent weeks regarding immigration and the wall, he continues to lie.îSanders stopped short of denouncing the presidentís repeated statements that call the science behind global warming into question. But as he gears up for a second White House bid, the senator is making climate change a central focus of his campaign.†In December, he hosted a televised town hall talk on global warming and repeatedly tried to push the policy debate beyond whether or not climate science is real and toward ìa political revolution that takes on the fossil fuel billionaires, accelerates our transition to clean energy, and finally puts people before the profits of polluters.îIn a twist, a right-wing commentator seemingly alluded to Sandersí words on Tuesday.†Erick Erickson, a vocal conservative critic of Trump, suggested on Twitter that, if GOP lawmakers cave to the presidentís border demands, ìit is only a matter of time before a progressive President declares climate change a national emergency and uses eminent domain to shutter coal plants, etc.î†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money to end the nearly three-week partial shutdown of the federal government, offering the deal as the only solution to a major national security crisis. He put the onus on congressional lawmakers to craft such a plan to reopen more than half a dozen federal agencies that have remained partly shuttered since before Christmas.ìHow much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?î Trump asked during the address. ìFor those who refuse to compromise in the name of job security, I would ask, imagine if it were your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis.îTrump repeated several mistruths in an attempt to tout the barrier, casting migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. as criminals and listing off a slew of crimes that critics saw as an attempt to generate fear.After the #TrumpAddress, @SenSchumer & I are talking about the facts & how we can end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/hoqAKwoqf9ìThis president just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration,î Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a televised address after Trumpís speech.During the address,†Trump also tried to pit Americans of color against undocumented immigrants in his quest for public sympathy.ìAll Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest-hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans,î said Trump, who largely won his election by playing to the anxieties of white voters.He also repeated misleading claims that Mexico would indirectly pay for the wall through a revised trade deal, an assertion that has been debunked by leading economists. Trade experts say any benefits from the revamped deal would be dwarfed by the cost of the wall.The presidentís address, which ran for around 10 minutes, was carried by every major television network in America as well as some cable providers. The media giants had to make quick decisions as to whether they would accommodate Trump, who tweeted his intentions to speak to the country during prime time in a missive just a day earlier.About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the partial shutdown thus far, and many have been required to go to work without pay. There are no signs the shutdown will end anytime soon with the presidentís latest demands.Leading Democrats demanded they be given equal airtime to counter the presidentís address, which contained multiple falsehoods and mistruths. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) fired back shortly after Trump ended his speech, saying the presidentís recent behavior was ìfull of misinformation and even malice.îìThe president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts,î Pelosi said, noting that House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government on the first day of the new Congress. ìThe president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would reopen government ó over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall.îTrump had reportedly been working with White House staff to create justification to declare a national emergency†to build the wall unilaterally, but made no such announcement on Tuesday. Democratic lawmakers have vowed to challenge the administration if it attempts to do so, and such a move would guarantee the issue would go to federal court.The president plans to travel to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday.This is a developing story.

Itís also what our professionals at the border want and need,î Trump said,†describing the impasse as a ìchoice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.îBut the only thing resembling a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border isnít an existential threat to national security <U+2015> itís the question of how to handle a historically high number of Central American families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation. The White House position on the issue is clear: Trump wants to either indefinitely detain the Central American migrants or cast them back to Mexico. But the wall wonít achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved Trumpís way to the presidency back in 2016.There was no border crisis when Trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the Southern border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, thereís still no crisis <U+2015> the unauthorized population of the United States has remained flat for more than a decade.What has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are Central American asylum seekers <U+2015> often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates Trump. But since he took office, the number of Central American families crossing has risen to historic highs.In 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by Border Patrol were families and unaccompanied children <U+2015> instead, most were single men. As of November 2018,†families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.The Trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it <U+2015> ìzero toleranceî prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the National Guard and U.S. military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum <U+2015> have stopped them from arriving.That trend isnít particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 <U+2015> Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras <U+2015> all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world. And now, Trumpís focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.Customs and Border Protection officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that ìmeteringî policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread. With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a large swath of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.If they reach the U.S., families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded Border Patrol stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. The Washington Post reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children†died while in Border Patrol custody. In June, Trump implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.Trump won the presidency in 2016 largely by fabricating a border crisis and hawking a massive wall as the solution to the contrived problem. Now, heís upped the ante, by portraying migrant children and families from Latin America as a security threat so grave that the federal government shouldnít reopen without committing to building a symbolic wall to, in theory, keep them out.

However, the president has consistently propagated various lies about the wall, including his sensationalist claim that former presidents support its construction.The CNN host remarked that Trump had built nothing more than a ìwall of liesî around the entire issue.ìThere may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration,î he said.ìTrumpís own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch,î Tapper later added.Watch Tapper take on Trumpís ìwall of liesî in the clip below."

But McConnell did not mention that on Tuesday.The legislative package Democrats blocked Tuesday includes security assistance to Israel and Jordan, sanctions on the Syria regime,†and a measure that aims to block boycotts of Israel. Some Democrats have endorsed bills disallowing boycotts, but critics say such measures†violate the First Amendment right to free speech.In a 56-44 vote, Democrats denied the package the chamberís required 60-vote threshold to open debate. Four Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the bill: Doug Jones of Alabama, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.McConnell on Tuesday immediately moved to bring up the foreign policy bill again later this week, signaling he had no intention of backing down to the Democratsí demands. His office also issued a press release noting that the Democratic-controlled Senate continued to pass bills amid the 2013 federal government shutdown, which was more severe and affected more workers.Itís unclear how long Democrats can remain united in blocking legislation from coming to the floor. Whereas nearly a dozen Democratic senators have pledged to filibuster all unrelated bills <U+2015> following the urging of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) <U+2015> from coming to the floor, others are reserving judgment on future legislation.ìIíve made no decision on future votes without knowing what the bills are,î Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Tuesday, adding that ìthereís simply no tellingî if Democrats will continue the blockade into the future.A public lands bill that was held over from the last Congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example <U+2015> and it has support from a number of Western Democratic senators.Trump threatened last week to keep the federal government partly closed for ìmonths or even yearsî if he did not get $5.7 billion for his wall at the southern border. But he is also considering declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation on the border, allowing him to direct the Department of Defense to construct the wall instead.There was little agreement among members of his own party on Capitol Hill if he could or should bypass Congress with an emergency declaration, however.ìThatís not my preferred route. I donít know legally if you could do that,î Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Tuesday, noting that such an† emergency declaration is likely to be challenged in court.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), another Trump ally in Congress, agreed.ìThereís a hard way and an easy way to do things. I think that would definitely be the hard way,î Cornyn said.But Sen.

But the ongoing partial government shutdown <U+2015> which is leaving some of the nationís lowest-paid law enforcement officials working without a paycheck <U+2015> risks creating a new crisis of corruption within the nationís prisons, airports and, ironically, at the border. Federal law enforcement agencies like the Bureau of Prisons, the Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have long struggled with integrity issues, from smuggling contraband into prisons and stealing from luggage to taking bribes at the border. Forcing employees of these law enforcement agencies <U+2015> which have also struggled with morale issues <U+2015> to work without pay could exacerbate corruption problems, some experts told HuffPost. When unpaid law enforcement employees get desperate, some could become compromised. ìAs this thing goes on, and as peopleís financial situations become more dire, it always increases the risk for corruption,î says John Roth, the former inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes TSA and CBP. ìItís ironic that youíre increasing the risk of corruption at the same time as youíre attempting to fortify the border.îRoth, who†retired in late 2017, told HuffPost he was particularly concerned about border patrol agents going without pay because they often work in isolation and their work gives them a tremendous opportunity to engage in corruption. The screening process for border patrol agents <U+2015> who start out with a base salary of around $40,000 <U+2015> has†become lax†as CBPís employee population exploded. Like a lot of law enforcement organizations, Customs and Border Patrol has an inadequate internal affairs system that a 2016 watchdog report found leaves it ìvulnerable to a corruption scandal that could potentially threaten the security of our nation.îWhile dozens of CBP employees have been prosecuted for corruption in recent years, experts believe the level of corruption within border patrol isnít fully recognized. Much of the border patrol corruption involves moving drugs or human trafficking, the type of problems that Trump has highlighted in his rhetoric about the southern border. The border patrol union, a conservative organization that has boosted Trump and his border wall, is backing Trump and the shutdown. Leaders of the National Border Patrol Council appeared alongside Trump at an unusual event in the White House press room last week, where they offered support for Trumpís standoff with Congress over billions in border wall funding. ìWe are all affected by this shutdown,î union official Art Del Cueto told the White House press corps. ìWe have skin in the game.î Union President Brandon Judd said it was ìnot trueî that federal employees donít agree with the government shutdown. Union officials didnít respond to requests for comment.Transportation Security Administration, where officers earn a base salary of $37,000 a year, has also been under scrutiny for employee misconduct. The agency, which struggles with morale issues, has seen several prosecutions in recent years involving drug smuggling and theft of passenger property. Hundreds of TSA employees have called in sick during the shutdown, some in hopes of working other jobs that would actually give them a paycheck. Federal prisons <U+2015> which house nearly 152,000 federal inmates, are another point of vulnerability. The average correctional officer starts out making the mid-$40,000 range, and their paychecks are about to stop in the next few days.Aaron McGlothin, a local union president for Mendota federal prison in California, said heís driving for Uber on nights and weekends to make ends meet. Most of his co-workers live paycheck to paycheck, and not being able to afford gas to get to work <U+2015> where theyíre not getting paid <U+2015> is a real threat. That opens the gate to potential corruption, he says.ìYou always have those few bad apples that you donít know, and now youíre getting inmates knowing whatís going on,î he said. ìThis is an opportunity for them to prey on staff, give you $500 bucks or something and say ëGet me some cigarettes.íîìThereís a huge morale hit that happens when something like this happens, and the expectation is that youíre going to be working for weeks at time without a paycheck,î said Roth, the former DHS inspector general. Rick Heldreth <U+2015> the union president for correctional staff at Hazelton, the federal prison in West Virginia beset with safety issues where Whitey Bulger was recently killed <U+2015> believes that morale hit is directly impacting his staffís ability to properly patrol the prison. In the last week, there have been three attacks on staff, with several minor injuries.Absenteeism plays a major role in those threats, Heldreth says, as the ìblue fluî isnít solely a TSA problem.On top of the rising absenteeism <U+2015> McGlothin estimates his prison is at 20 percent <U+2015> and worsening safety issues, the shutdown is distracting correction workers from their normal levels of vigilance, Heldreth argued.ìThe staff is distracted wondering if theyíll able to pay their bills, people worry about losing their houses and their cars and afford health care and child care, on top of regular pressures,î he told HuffPost. Heldreth said he was forced to chose not to visit his parents over the Christmas holiday season to save cash.†He also said heís been worried for the last few weeks about the potential corruption issue. After all, heís not alone: The government monitors the credit of federal correctional officers to make sure theyíre not easily compromised.ìAnd here it is out for public consumption that weíre all in financial difficulty,î†Heldreth added.One BOP registered nurse, who emailed HuffPostís tipline and whose husband is also employed by BOP, said that the shutdown had cut off all of their household income. ìWe have three children, and bills just as everyone else. It is beyond me that my livelihood is held hostage due to someoneís temper tantrums,î the BOP employee said. †McGlothin said that BOP employeesí opinion on the president <U+2015> and Congress, who they also blame <U+2015> is dropping by the day.ìI voted for Trump <U+2015> I donít support him right now; I donít support him with this shutdown,î†he said.†ìHeís never turned a fucking wrench in his life, heís never used a shovel to work hard labor <U+2015> heís always had everything handed to him on a silver platter.îìThe hardworking people of the federal government are working without pay and heís still eating lobster.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Perdue didnít make any promises about what would happen in March.President Donald Trump initiated the partial government shutdown last month in an effort to make Congress pay for a border wall that he previously said Mexico would fund. Congress has shown no willingness to play along, and Trump has said the shutdown could go on for ìmonths or even years.îìFor now we have solved the problem of what to do about February SNAP benefits,î Perdue said Tuesday. ìI believe this is ample time for Congress to act.îPerdue said the U.S. Department of Agriculture would still have a $3 billion contingency fund that it might be able to use for benefits in March, but he didnít offer any details about the agencyís plans for that month.Food assistance, commonly known as food stamps, is one of the federal governmentís most responsive antipoverty programs. Suspending benefits, which is what would apparently happen if the shutdown continues past March, would have serious economic consequences <U+2015> and create a lot more hunger.Word that the federal shutdown could suspend SNAP benefits has spread through state and local media since last week. Just on Tuesday, local reporters in Hawaii, New Jersey,†South Carolina, Utah†and several other states filed stories on the shutdown possibly bringing hunger to town.Perdueís plan will be no small administrative feat. The USDA is telling state agencies to suspend their normal operations this week so they can instead prepare to issue Februaryís benefits early. States are responsible for taking federal SNAP funds and loading them onto debit cards for program enrollees to spend on food at grocery stores. The average benefits come to about $123 per month per person.Itís good that the government has guaranteed SNAP benefits through February, said Stacy Dean, a nutrition policy expert with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.†But, she said, ìif the shutdown continues we face the same dilemma in March.î† †Some experts have said thereís no reason for USDA to suspend food benefits just because Congress hasnít appropriated funds, arguing that the government ought to treat SNAP as an ìentitlementî like Social Security or Medicare. Those programs continue on autopilot even in a government shutdown.Perdue and his spokespeople have not responded to questions about paying SNAP benefits without an appropriation.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

National parks typically close during government shutdowns, but the Trump administration kept them open during this partial shutdown without funding, leaving them sorely understaffed and lacking resources for sanitation and maintenance.About eight rangers are currently on hand to oversee Joshua Treeís sprawling 790,636 acres, Land told The Los Angeles Times. Without comprehensive oversight, the park has fallen victim to irresponsible visitors over the winter holiday.ìWhile the vast majority of those who visit Joshua Tree National Park do so in a responsible manner, there have been incidents of new roads being created by motorists and the destruction of Joshua trees in recent days that have precipitated the closure,î Land said.Though Land said in his statement the park would reopen ìto limited basic services in the coming days,î he told the Los Angeles Times that the site could remain closed for the duration of the shutdown.President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders have made little headway in recent days in reopening government functions affected by the shutdown. The president continues to demand more than $5 billion for†some version of a wall or steel barrier†along the southern border.In the meantime, national parks around the country have witnessed streams of visitors <U+2015> sometimes failing to pay entrance fees <U+2015> while overburdened staff have tried to mitigate the public health hazard of over trash and human waste.In some cases, emergency services may have been impacted as well.

The share who consider it very serious now stands at 42 percent, up from one-third last week.The shift also means that concerns now surpass the publicís worries about last yearís brief January shutdown, which was seen as at least somewhat serious by only 64 percent of Americans in HuffPost/YouGovís polling.Twenty-three percent of Americans now say theyíve been affected in some way by the current shutdown or that they expect to be, up from 10 percent at the start of the shutdown. For some, that simply means living with the sense that their government isnít working.†But other responses were more specific. Several said theyíd reconsidered visits to national parks or expressed looming†concerns about tax season. (The White House has since announced that tax refunds will be paid regardless of the status of the shutdown.)For many federal workers and their families, the shutdown has already had a serious financial impact, forcing some to max out credit cards or borrow money from relatives.ìMy husband works for the government and is currently furloughed,î wrote one woman polled who said she was concerned for her familyís ìimmediate financial futureî and that she disapproved of the role both congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump had played in the shutdown.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it. If youíre willing to be interviewed, please provide a phone number.Americans are 34 points more likely to disapprove than they are to approve of the way Congress has handled the shutdown. The public also disapproves of the performance of the congressional GOP, specifically (-29), and, by smaller margins, of Trumpís performance (-17) and congressional Democratsí actions (-9); theyíre about split on the performance of their own representatives (+2).The results appear to represent a modest reversion from the change seen in last weekís survey, although, as before, itís unclear to what extent the movement reflects a genuine shift in opinion, rather than the kind of fluctuation inherent to tracking surveys.A 51 percent majority of Americans say Trump deserves at least partial responsibility for the shutdown, with 41 percent naming Democrats in Congress, and 35 percent putting at least some responsibility on Republicans in Congress. Those numbers are largely similar to where they stood last week.In contrast with shutdowns from previous years, thereís so far been relatively little polling on this one, perhaps in part because its start coincided with Christmas and the new year.An†Ipsos/Reuters tracking poll finds that currently about half of Americans mostly blame Trump for the shutdown, with 32 percent naming congressional Democrats and 6 percent congressional Republicans.†Another survey from Morning Consult, taken at the beginning of the shutdown, bore similar results, with 43 percent of voters saying Trump was most to blame, 31 percent pointing the finger at Democrats in Congress, and 7 percent naming the congressional GOP.An Economist/YouGov poll taken over New Yearís also gave President Trump the plurality of the blame, and found that 40 percent of the public believe Trump should accept the Democratsí current offer of $1.6 billion for border security, with just 24 percent saying Democrats should agree to spend $5 billion for a border wall.

Since the shutdown, many have been furloughed or have received ìstop workî orders, putting them out of work, and without pay, until the government is running again.

But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nationís greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018.Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year, the second largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group. The analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change. The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. ìI donít believe it,î President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administrationís report. He added that ìweíre the cleanest weíve ever been.î Between 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have†touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the presidentís†decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change.At a Dec. 11 briefing on the Environmental Protection Agencyís proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler credited Trumpís leadership for a 2.7 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from 2016 and 2017. ìWe are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for,î Wheeler said. ìWe are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. Weíre moving forward. Weíre addressing the issue.î Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administrationís ìregulatory philosophyî is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at ìthe leading edge of technology.î The U.S. has ìlead the chargeî in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added.ìWeíre doing the right thing,î Zinke said. ìBut itís a narrative thatís very difficult to get across.î Zinke repeated this defense in a parting interview last month with Fox Newsí Bret Baier. ìEveryone else is up,î he said, referring to other countriesí overall emissions. ìWeíre going down while we have our record-breaking oil and gas production.îBut as Rhodium Groupís new analysis makes clear, that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick <U+2015> the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid-2009 <U+2015> comes despite a record number of coal-fired power plants going offline, replaced largely by the use of natural gas.Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the ìlimited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies,î the analysis found.ìThe U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets,î it stated. ìThe gap is even wider headed into 2019.îResponding to Rhodiumís analysis, May Boeve, executive director of climate advocacy group 350.org, stressed that the Trump administration energy and environmental policies come with consequences.ìWith a new Congress in session, we demand they heed these warnings (about climate change) and step up to act at the scale of the crisis,î she said in a statement.The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obamaís Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

President Donald Trump has said the shutdown could continue for months or a year. The people who get food benefits will go hungry if this happens. The late 20th century expansion of the food stamp program helped eradicate starvation in the U.S. But Professor David Super, an expert on administrative and welfare law at Georgetown University Law School, argues that the conventional wisdom misreads the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programís underlying statute. Super points to the text of the Food and Nutrition Act, which indicates more than once that anyone who is poor enough to qualify for benefits is supposed to get them. ìAssistance under this program shall be furnished to all eligible households who make application for such participation,î the law says. While it may seem obvious that people should get benefits for which theyíre eligible, the wording is significant. It echoes the ìentitlementî language in the Social Security Act that preserves health and retirement benefits for seniors even if the federal government is partially shuttered. Super is not alone in his analysis. ìWe have long agreed with some legal experts that SNAPís authorizing law requires SNAP benefits continue during a shutdown,î Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email. The CBPP is an influential liberal think tank.†The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency has been mostly silent about what will happen to food assistance during a prolonged shutdown, except for a late December press release that only indicated it had funds for Januaryís benefits. Itís not clear what would happen in February if the government remains closed. If the USDA reversed itself and said benefits would continue despite a prolonged shutdown, it would be in good company. The Internal Revenue Service had said it would collect tax revenue but not issue refunds <U+2015> until Monday, when officials†said the agency would dish out refunds after all.†ìIf the shutdown continues and USDA determines it does not have the authority to extend SNAP in the absence of congressional action, many low-income households would be at risk of serious hunger and hardship,î Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post,†adding that food banks would see dramatic increases in needy families.Ending SNAP would not only cause material hardship for the programís beneficiaries <U+2015> most of whom are very young, elderly or disabled <U+2015> it would also rattle the economy. Joe Brusuelas, an economist with the accounting firm RSM, estimated a full year without SNAP benefits would reduce gross domestic product by as much as 1 percent. (For comparison, most analyses of the new Republican tax law said it would boost GDP by less than 1 percent in its early years.) A spokesman for House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) declined to say whether the chairman agreed that food aid could continue to operate despite the shutdown.Itís not just the entitlement language that should protect SNAP benefits. Though lawmakers have appropriated money for SNAP annually, Super argues they have also amended the statute over the years to make SNAP less contingent on appropriations. †ìThe conventional wisdom, that SNAP must terminate benefits absent an appropriation, was correct under the statute as it once existed,î Super said in an email. ìBut, as often happens, the conventional wisdom failed to update as Congress repeatedly amended the statute.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

All four major news networks plan to air the event live from the Oval Office, and millions of Americans are expected to watch.But Trump, who campaigned with a promise to build a ìbig, beautiful wallî along the U.S.-Mexico border (and to get Mexico to pay for it), has long turned to mistruths and outright lies in an effort to get the structure funded.Here are some of the biggest falsehoods the president is likely to tell on Tuesday.Trump has regularly claimed that Democrats are the ìparty of crimeî and want ìopen bordersî with Mexico, both blatantly false statements. Leading Democrats have argued for years now that a wall along the southern border would be wasteful and ineffective, instead supporting legislation that would increase border security efforts.In June, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pointed out that in 2013, long before Trump was elected, every Senate Democrat supported a $40 billion funding effort to step up protection of the border, a proposal that would have provided funding to hire thousands of border agents and hundreds of miles of fencing.Dozens of lawmakers have also supported legislation to give young undocumented immigrants who have spent their lives in America, known as Dreamers, a pathway to citizenship.†About 800,000 federal employees have been affected by the shutdown thus far. Many have been furloughed, but thousands, including airport security workers, have been forced to go to work without pay while the stalemate continues.Trump claimed last week that ìmaybe most of those people ... are the biggest fan of what weíre doingî and that he really believed ìa lot of them want to see border security.î But heís made such assertions without any evidence, and as HuffPostís Amanda Terkel notes, polls have found most Americans do not support the wall or funding for it.All four living former presidents have thrown cold water on Trumpís claim that some of his predecessors ìtold me that we should haveî built the wall.Former President Jimmy Carter said he didnít support Trump on the issue. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush told Politico they hadnít spoken with the White House. Former President Barack Obama has spoken against the wall†publicly and hasnít interacted with Trump since leaving office in 2017, aside from a small encounter at former President George H.W. Bushís funeral last month.†Trumpís campaign assertion that the Mexican government would pay for his wall quickly fell away after he assumed office. But the president has continued to promise that†Americaís southern neighbor would do so through the revised North American Free Trade Agreement that would pay for the structure ìmany, many times over.îOutside economists and trade experts told HuffPostís S.V. Date, however, that any trade benefits wonít be anywhere near the billions of dollars necessary to construct the barrier.ìWhat it really is is American consumers paying higher prices for stuff,î Monica de Bolle, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told HuffPost last week. ìSo itís the American consumer whoís paying for the wall, if you want to look at it that way.îMembers of the Trump administration have been cherry-picking statistics in thinly veiled attempts to paint migrants attempting to seek asylum in the U.S. as terrorists or gang members. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Friday that 3,000 ìspecial interest aliensî had been apprehended trying to enter the country from the southern border, but that designation applies to anyone who simply comes from a country that has ever produced a terrorist, according to Fox Newsí Chris Wallace.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to peddle a similarly false statistic in an interview with Wallace on Sunday, saying 4,000 suspected or known terrorists had come into the country illegally while implying that they had passed through the southern border. But Wallace said that was a mistruth, and in fact those people had been taken into custody at airports.Studies show that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens, and states with more undocumented people have less crime than states with fewer.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Borrowing money from relatives. Searching for interest-free loans. Federal workers and their families are doing whatever they can to save a few dollars and eke by as the partial government shutdown continues with no imminent end in sight. Many are fearful weeks will go by without another payday, forcing them to take on debt or find side jobs in order to cover housing and food costs.ìWeíre going to have to trim some fat and see how long we last,î said Scott Reyna, a former air traffic controller whose wife works for the Transportation Security Administration. She isnít being paid during the shutdown, even though she continues to work.ìIím still getting my pension, so weíll be living on that and credit cards until theyíre maxed out,î Reyna said. ìAfter that, I have no idea.î For Kathryn Smith, the shutdown has meant forgoing her medication for lupus in order to pay the bills and buy food.ìMy husband is a disabled vet. I have lupus. Iím disabled,î said Smith, whose husband is a furloughed federal worker. ìI canít get my medications right now, because, what are we going to do? Make sure you have your groceries or make sure you have your medication. Itís going to put me in a flare, and we know, but what can we do?îShe and her husband had some savings, but they exhausted a chunk of that money recently when they had to pay veterinary bills after an unexpected emergency with their dog.ìDo you know how embarrassing it is to go to your kid and say, ëHey, I have to borrow the house payment?íî Smith said. ìWe had to go to our son. Heís being supportive as much as he can, but he has an infant in his house. We shouldnít be borrowing money from our kids.î†The government shutdown that began Dec. 22 has left 380,000 federal workers furloughed and another 420,000 working without pay. (Roughly three-quarters of government functions have already been funded by Congress and are not affected by the impasse.)†President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders have made little headway in recent days as Trump continues to demand more than $5 billion for a wall <U+2015> or perhaps a steel barrier of some kind†<U+2015>†along the southern border. Meanwhile, federal employees and contractors are reckoning with the possibility that the shutdown will drag on for months, leaving them no steady income to pay mounting bills. Federal workers have received back pay after previous shutdowns, but only retroactively through an act of Congress after the government has reopened.The shutdown is already the second-longest on record. Trump has said that it could last for ìyearsî if Democrats donít agree to his demands <U+2015> a warning thatís rattled feds with dwindling bank accounts.Nathaniel Shenton, a federal worker based in Maryland, said he received his last paycheck just before the New Year. He said he had enough savings put away to support his wife and two children for roughly one pay period without a check. But if the shutdown stretches into the latter half of January, he isnít sure how heíll cover his mortgage, car payments and the groceries.ìThe real thing is if we miss two paychecks. If we miss two, Iím pretty screwed, to be honest,î said Shenton, who is classified as ìessentialî and has continued to work during the shutdown. ìWe just donít know when itís going to end. Thereís no indication, no sign that thereís any kind of headway being made.îShenton said he plans on talking to his mortgage lender about deferring a payment, and hopes to get an interest-free loan through his bank, Navy Federal Credit Union. For now, he and his wife have stopped driving anywhere unless necessary to save gas money, and have resolved to cut out the pricier organic foods for their 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son. †ìWeíre not millionaires,î he said of the typical federal worker. ìItís incredibly stressful and it can be really damaging for us.îArash, a federal employee who is still working during the shutdown, has cut out entertainment costs in his life, like going to dinner with friends, Netflix and Hulu. He was lucky enough to get extensions on his two credit cards, but now heís looking at taking out another credit card that offers zero percent interest for the first year, just so he can have an extra line of money. ìI think I make a decent salary, but that doesnít mean I donít live paycheck to paycheck,î said Arash, who asked to be identified by only his first name. ìMy extended family relies on me financially as well. ... Thereís a lot of financial anxiety that goes into it because thereís just no clear end goal. There doesnít seem to be any progress.îDaniel Moragne, a federal contractor in Louisiana who isnít even sure if heíll get back pay, is, at the age of 67, wondering if heíll lose his apartment if the federal government doesnít get its act together.While the Office of Personnel Management put out sample letters for federal workers to use to ask for leniency with their rent or other payments to creditors, for people like Moragne, itís not that simple. He pays his rent online, and he doesnít even have a way to personally contact his landlord. Therefore, he canít ask for leniency or explain that itís not his fault that the government canít get its act together.†ìIf I canít pay my rent, they will probably move to evict me, and Iíd be without a place to stay. ... I might be able to stay with my brother who lives here in town. Heís fairly close. But thatís not a given,î he said. ìI donít know. ...

The shutdown is also affecting staffing levels in air traffic control towers, according to Forbes.DePete urged Trump in his letter to ìtake the necessary steps to immediately end the shutdown of government agencies that is adversely affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system.îThe union president noted the importance of the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Department in safe flying.†ìWhen any of their responsibilities are placed on pause due to a shutdown there are safety, security and efficiency gaps that immediately emerge,î DePete wrote.The partial shutdown affects some 800,000 federal workers, but about half of those are considered essential workers ó including agents of TSA, which is part of DHS. They are expected to perform their jobs without pay during the shutdown. That has driven some TSA workers to use sick time to work elsewhere to pay the bills, according to the union.TSA officials have conceded that the number of TSA workers on the job was down, but said Friday that the reduction hadnít yet affected passenger checkpoint wait times. That appears to be changing as air travel begins to pick up again after the traditional slow time after the winter holidays.This TSA line at SeaTac is out of this world. Iíve NEVER been in a line this long before.DePete also noted in his letter that fewer Federal Aviation Administration safety inspectors are working ó ìfewer than are needed in order to ensure the air traffic control infrastructure is performing at its peak levels.îThe shutdown also impacts aircraft manufacturing oversight activities that have either stopped or are ìsignificantly reduced,î DePete wrote. ìThese safety and oversight inspections will potentially allow for the introduction of safety issues that put passengers and airline crews at risk.îThe shutdown began after Trump refused to sign any legislation that doesnít include $5.7 billion for his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The shutdown is now in its third week.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the pilots union letter.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, also said Trump would travel to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday.Shortly after the network confirmations, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement calling for Democrats to be given ìequal airtimeî to address the country.ìNow that the television networks have decided to air the Presidentís address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,î the pair said.The major networks <U+2015> ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC <U+2015> all committed on Tuesday to airing the Democratsí response, to be delivered by Pelosi and Schumer.The networksí decision is likely to be a costly one, as advertising spots in prime-time hours can cost millions of dollars in total. The New York Times notes that such addresses have grown increasingly rare and are usually reserved for moments of significant national importance, like President Barack Obamaís announcement of the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Some requests have been denied, with addresses aired on a tape delay, including a 2014†Obama speech on immigration.†Some questioned why major networks wouldnít use tape delay for Trumpís address in order to counter his persistent falsehoods about the border. CBS, the first network to announce it would air the speech, didnít immediately respond to an inquiry about its plans.The address comes in the midst of an ongoing partial government shutdown, during which Trump and Senate Republicans have refused to pass funding measures that donít include more than $5.6 billion for the wall. The shutdown has stretched into its third week, with no end in sight.The president has continued to tout his border wall, even as his definition of it has changed. Last weekend, he said he would be happy to build a steel barrier on the border rather than one made out of concrete, saying such a structure would ìlook beautiful and itís actually strong.î The White House has also released ìGame of Thronesîñstyle posters featuring a mock-up of the wall with Trumpís image hovering above it.Trump has also lied about support for the structure, falsely claiming that some of his predecessors had told him they supported a border fence.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who represents a state with a large number of federal employees, urged Senate Democrats to adopt the strategy in a tweet over the weekend. Since then, it has been endorsed by several progressive groups and nearly a dozen of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.Senate Democrats should block consideration of any bills unrelated to opening the government until Sen. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans allow a vote on the bipartisan bills the House passed to open the government. Mitch, donít delay. Letís vote!He will need nearly all Democrats on board, however, in order to prevent Republicans from clearing the chamberís 60-vote threshold to bring a measure to the floor.The first test will come Tuesday afternoon, when the Senate is scheduled to vote on a motion to proceed to open debate on a Republican Middle East policy package that includes Syria sanctions and a measure that aims to block boycotts of Israel. The latter has been endorsed by some Democrats, but critics say it violates the First Amendment right to free speech.A senior Senate Democratic aide said Monday that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) would join the opposition to taking up the foreign policy legislation, known as S.1, before the Senate votes on the House-passed spending bills.ìSenate Republicans should instead bring to the floor the House-passed bills to reopen the government,î the aide said Monday.Schumer is a prominent ally of Israel in the Senate, and he has backed similar measures that would have made it a felony for Americans to support the international boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), an author of the anti-boycott bill, argued that the shutdown is not really the reason Democrats are coming out against the foreign policy package.†ìA huge argument broke out at Senate Dem meeting last week over BDS. A significant # of Senate Democrats now support #BDS & Dem leaders want to avoid a floor vote that reveals that,î†Rubio tweeted Monday.†But Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who serves with Rubio on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, disputed that characterization in a tweet of his own.ìYou know it isnít true that ëa significant # of Senate Dems support BDSí. Really dangerous to play politics w support for Israel,î†Murphy tweeted.Itís unclear whether Democrats can remain united in blocking all legislation from coming to the floor. A public lands bill that was held over from the last Congress is expected to get a vote next week, for example <U+2015> and it has support from a number of Western Democratic senators.For now, though, the tactic seems to be Democratsí best hand before Trumpís national address and trip to the border later this week.ìSenate Republicans should not treat this legislative work period like itís a time to catch up on miscellaneous items.

The government has been partially shut down over this impasse.Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee, told CNNís Jake Tapper that not only is that rhetoric ìreally threatening,î but suggested that the president canít even do that.ìIf Harry Truman couldnít nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesnít have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,î Schiff said on Tapperís ìState of the Unionî Sunday. ìSo thatís a nonstarter.î†Truman had cited a national emergency during the Korean War to take control of the steel industry in 1952, but the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his executive order.Trumpís government shutdown has hinged on his demand for more than $5 billion in wall funding, but neither the president nor the newly empowered Democrats in the House of Representatives seem to be budging.Trump first floated the national emergency idea during a press conference Friday, but whether he can actually do so is a gray area, legal experts told NBC News.†ìHe can declare some kind of national emergency, but what it would allow him to do legally is a totally different question,î George Washington University professor and presidential power expert Matt Dallek told the outlet.Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet told NBC that Trump may actually be able to get his wall by turning to certain unused Defense Department funds that Congress doles out yearly with no specific intention.ìMy instinct is to say that if he declares a national emergency and uses this pot of unappropriated money for the wall, heís on very solid legal ground,î Tushnet said.†GOP and Democratic leaders have met multiple times to negotiate an end to the government shutdown, which went into effect Dec. 21, but acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says little progress has been made.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

An estimated 800,000 federal employees throughout the country have either been furloughed and are going without a salary or,†if deemed essential,†are working without getting paid.Vice President Mike Pence held meetings with Democratic congressional aides over the weekend at the White House, but the two sides appear dug-in with no deal in sight. Administration officials have said they wonít accept anything less than the $5.7 billion in wall funding they originally requested.†Trump further said Sunday he was considering whether to bypass Congress and build the wall by declaring a national emergency <U+2015> which would constitute an unprecedented use of executive powers. Some advisers close to the president are reportedly pushing him to do so if negotiations on the Hill drag on, a move that would put the Defense Department in charge of building the wall.ìWeíre looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency,î Trump told reporters on Sunday, per a pool report.Still, such an action would likely face an immediate legal challenge from congressional Democrats.ìI think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, Where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this,î Smith said on ìThis Week.îìBut beyond that, this would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars. The president spends most of his time talking about how weíre not spending enough on national security.

He also cited†State Department†reports that found ìno credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.îSanders responded, ìWe know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.îWallace, ready to pounce, interrupted Sanders with a blistering fact-check.ìWait wait, ícause I know the statistic,î he said. ìI didnít know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where theyíre captured? Airports.îThe exchange begins below around the 5:35 mark:ìNot always but certainly a large number,î Sanders said as Wallace continued to hammer his point.ìThe state department says there hasnít been any terrorists found coming across the southern border from Mexico,î he added.Sanders, seemingly ignoring the facts laid out before her, said terrorists enter the U.S. ìby air, itís by land, itís by seaî and that the southern border is the countryís ìmost vulnerable point of entry.îìBut theyíre not coming across the southern border, Sarah,î Wallace persisted. ìTheyíre coming and theyíre being stopped at airports.îSanders continued to dance around the facts, saying that terrorists are ìcoming a number of ways.îìIím not disagreeing with you that theyíre coming through airports,î she told Wallace. ìIím saying that they come by air by land and by sea, and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that weíre going to have an influx, not just of terrorists, but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people who are coming here to do American citizens harm.îTrump last month claimed the government had stopped terrorists from entering the U.S. from Mexico, but†Reuters reported†that no evidence backed up the presidentís assertion, according to four government sources.ìPeople are pouring into our country, including terrorists,î Trump had said. ìWe have terrorists. We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten. These are very serious people.îStudies show undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens.

The fight to have the measure included in a spending bill has lawmakers so divided that their work came to a screeching halt last month. However, Hannity doesnít think itís time for Washington to get back to work just yet.ìMy humble advice is the shutdown, as much as an inconvenience some people that work for the government and I hope they get their back pay, it needs to continue straight through the State of the Union and maybe beyond,î he said.ìThe State of the Union, the president, he can take his case directly to you, we the people. And while the president should support back pay for those furloughed employees, make no mistake <U+2015> no matter what the president does, he must hold firm on this border wall funding from Congress.îThe remark is significant given that Hannityís comments have influenced Trump in the past, as he is seen as an informal adviser to the president.Last August, USA Today reported that Trump weighed shutting down the government over border security before the midterm elections, citing Hannityís advice along with that of right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh.ìYou know who thinks it should be before?†Rush Limbaugh thinks it should be before the election. You know who else? Sean Hannity.

More than 38 million Americans receive monthly food benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is often known as food stamps and is arguably the federal governmentís most important anti-poverty program. If Trump keeps the government shut down through February, benefits could stop. The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs the program and is one of the federal agencies that shut down last month as part of Trumpís strategy to force Congress to pay for a giant wall on the Mexican border. Itís just one of dozens of programs <U+2015> including tax credit refunds for the working poor <U+2015> that will be disrupted if the shutdown continues. The USDA has said only that it has enough leftover money to pay for Januaryís benefits. Its reserve fund amounts to less than the total projected cost of Februaryís benefits. After February, itís possible there would be nothing. Other food programs that serve seniors, mothers and children could also be affected. Spokespeople for the USDA did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.President Trump said Friday that the shutdown, which is already two weeks old, could go on for months or even a year. Since he has already taken credit for the shutdown, and since his border security demand is so vague <U+2015> does he want a wall, or a fence? <U+2015> itís hard to see how the situation could change unless Trump caves.A shutdown lasting many months or a year would be a massive policy experiment. Yanking food benefits from millions of people would probably result in a lot more hunger. Outright starvation hasnít been a public health problem in the U.S. since the food stamp program expanded in the 1960s and 1970s <U+2015> what happens if food stamps suddenly disappear?†There is a far more robust network of food banks than in the 1960s, but thereís no way charity could make up the difference between a huge national program and no program at all.The Trump administration has kept relatively quiet about the threat to food assistance. When a funding lapse approached in 2015, the Obama administrationís USDA warned lawmakers that there wasnít enough money for the following monthís benefits. The present situation is slightly different than 2015 since the agency seems to have a larger funding reserve this time around. But a USDA employee who is not authorized to speak publicly told HuffPost some within the agency suspected current leadership didnít want to talk about the possible negative effect on SNAP because doing so would highlight the shutdownís harm to struggling Americans instead of furloughed government employees. Trump has vilified federal workers and claimed theyíre all Democrats.One option to prevent the benefit cutoff would be for the USDA to adopt a new legal interpretation and say that SNAP recipients are entitled to benefits even if Congress hasnít appropriated annual funds for the program, since SNAP has been authorized for the next five years by the farm bill.Thereís no doubt that even a partial reduction in benefits in February would have a big effect on individual beneficiaries and the economy. When Democrats cut SNAP benefit amounts by about 13 percent in 2013, to pay for improvements to the National School Lunch Program, the impact reverberated through both low-income households and corporate boardrooms.The way SNAP works is the government distributes food benefits on debit cards that program enrollees then redeem for food items at grocery stores <U+2015> meaning retailers benefit substantially from the program, which costs more than $60 billion annually. When the benefit cut occurred in 2013, chains like Walmart and Target cut their earnings forecasts. Dollar General stockholders have claimed in a lawsuit the firm had failed to notify them how badly business would be harmed by other SNAP reductions. Local media has been covering the shutdownís possible threat to food assistance since last week. More than a million low-income Georgians could lose their benefits in February, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Thursday. An official with Alabamaís food aid program told a local TV station they expected more guidance from the USDA at the end of the month. Arizona food banks are worried about a surge in demand if the government shutdown continues into February. The possibility of lost food assistance caught the White House by surprise, the Washington Post reported Friday. Administration spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

On Thursday, Trump doubled down on the shutdown, saying it could last for months or even years if he doesnít get what he wants.Bidenís comments echo that of Rep.†Tim Ryan†(D-Ohio), who also pointed to Limbaugh and Coulter as key motivators in getting Trump to call for the shutdown.ìWeíre dealing with someone who is dishonest,î Ryan said of president on MSNBC Wednesday. ìYou could make a deal in a room with a handshake and by the time heís out of the room the dealís over, heís in front of the camera. And letís just put this all in perspective. The main problem here is heís worried about the investigation thatís breathing down his neck right now.

Trump acknowledged afterward in his press conference at the White House that he does not like the term ìgovernment shutdown,î as no one blamed for one would. ìI donít call it a shutdown,î Trump said, before offering a less-than-concise alternative: ìI call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and the safety of our country.îAnyone with the slightest understanding of the impasse in Washington knows that whatís going on is not a strike. A strike is a work stoppage initiated by workers. But in this case, some 380,000 federal employees are furloughed and another 420,000 are working without pay because Congress and the White House have not funded their agencies. In labor parlance, whatís happening is more like the polar opposite of a strike: a lockout. Thatís a work stoppage initiated by management, in which workers are denied access to their jobs.†Like a strike, a lockout usually happens during a labor dispute, in an effort to gain leverage. There was no workplace dispute that led to the shutdown. Rather, lawmakers and the White House simply failed to carry out their responsibilities and appropriate funding for roughly a quarter of government functions. But to government employees, the effect is the same: Workers who are willing to clock in are denied paychecks and many are barred from even venturing onto the job site, as a result of decisions made by management.ìSure, itís a lockout,î Jacque Simon, policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 700,000 government workers, told HuffPost. ìThatís what it is.îThe shutdown began on Dec. 22, when funding lapsed for several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department. Workers whose duties are considered ìessential,î such as law enforcement, have continued to work. Any pay those workers get would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress, after the government reopens.†The same goes for the hundreds of thousands of workers who are furloughed and not working. Those workers are not even supposed to check their emails during the shutdown.Trump has threatened that the shutdown may go on for months or even years. If it stretches into Monday <U+2015> and there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough <U+2015> it will become the second-longest government shutdown ever.

And while Trump is characterizing the barrier as a non-negotiable tenet of border security, immigrant experts told HuffPost itís an ineffective solution that will endanger migrant families.Advocates say the wall could force people to take dangerous journeys to cross the border or threaten parents and childrenís health by making them languish in unsanitary shelters near ports of entry. Experts are especially concerned about the well-being of migrant kids after a boy and a girl recently died in Border Patrol custody.ìFortifying the border is just going to lead to more deaths,î said Elissa Steglich, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who teaches a clinic for immigrant families. ì[Itís] giving business to sophisticated smugglers who are going to be taking migrants through more perilous and life-threatening circumstances.îThe number of migrant families being apprehended at the border reached record-high levels of more than 25,000 last month <U+2015> a number thatís risen by more than 13 percent since 2013.Experts say Trumpís wall, which the Department Of Homeland Security estimated would amount to more than 330 miles of fencing, wonít deter families from trying to cross the border even as it makes their journeys more dangerous.ìYou canít deter away a refugee flow,î said Jennifer Podkul, the director of policy for Kids in Need of Defense. ìIf someone thinks they are not going to live if they stay in their country of origin, they will go and try to find safety somewhere else.îIn the í90s, the government built fences in border cities such as San Diego, California,†and El Paso, Texas, which forced immigrants to make more perilous journeys through the mountains and desert. The number of migrants who died trying to reach the U.S. has†skyrocketed†and the bodies of nearly 3,000 migrants have been found in southern Arizona since 2000, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner.The number of families apprehended by Border Patrol while traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a part of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by†more than 1,500 percent†over the past year because of policies that dissuade immigrants from using legal ports of entry and an increased military presence at the border. Advocates worry a border wall will only exacerbate the problem and lead to more health issues for children traveling through remote regions that lack access to medical services.In December, 7-year-old Jackelin Caal Maquin traveled from Guatemala through the New Mexico desert with her father before dying from dehydration and shock in Border Patrol custody. After turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents, Caal and her father traveled three hours by bus to the nearest Border Patrol station in Lordsburg, New Mexico. Jackelin was later transported by helicopter to a childrenís hospital after having seizures.ìThe U.S. government has made a strategic decision to force people to only cross in areas where death is more likely,î said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Instituteís Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity. ì[A wall] will create more deaths in the desert and more people suffering on their way here.îImmigration experts say a border wall will also drive migrant families to use smugglers to navigate precarious border crossing routes. Some smugglers are involved in human trafficking or the drug trade, putting children in extremely dangerous situations. Steglichís child clients have told her stories of being forced into prostitution, made to carry drugs across the border or being locked in hotel rooms for weeks.ìAnytime you make it more difficult to cross, you empower cartel and smugglers and organized criminals who control the crossing points and the border,î said Bier. †Experts also worry that a wall will cause†further backlogs at legal ports of entry, where some migrants have been waiting for months to cross the border due to the Trump administrationís crackdown on asylum-seekers. As a result, thousands of immigrants who arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, with a migrant caravan last month are languishing in sometimes unsanitary shelters for their turn to legally cross the border. Others have tried to enter the U.S. between ports of entry, which can be especially dangerous for children. Last month, two Guatemalan teens injured themselves after climbing the border wall separating Arizona from Mexico and falling 18 feet. Other migrants, including children, have been tear-gassed or hit with rubber bullets while trying to cross the border illegally. Immigration experts say the money Trump is requesting to build a wall would be better spent on more Border Patrol agents to process migrants, a more efficient immigration court system and technology to detect drugs and weapons at the border. Steglich says that in addition to forcing people into physically dangerous situations, the wall enforces a dangerous mentality that migrants should be treated like criminals instead of humans.ìIf you are looking at a migrant as a national security threat, youíre going to be more callous,î she said. ìYouíre not going to be as attentive to the humanitarian needs of a mother or child before you.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Címon yíall. Can we be real?îTrump wrote about the concrete idea on Twitter as recently as the end of December.An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!Aside from the matter of building materials, Lemon also ripped Trumpís demands that Congress approve money to pay for the wall, an issue which sent the government into a partial shutdown more than two weeks ago as it left lawmakers divided in the House and the Senate.Earlier in the day, the president claimed he could declare a national emergency to get his wall, a point disputed by Lemon and others.<U+2033>The fact is, there is no national emergency at our southern border,î Lemon said. ìThis is simply another attempt by this president to get his way by doing an end run around Congress to get his precious wall, the wall he is willing to shut down the federal government for, the wall he has been talking about for years.îIn a fact check of Trumpís claim, NBC News spoke with experts in presidential power and legal matters who argued that while an emergency could be called, the amount of money he would be able to access at that point remains unclear and congressional approval for the the spending would likely still be required."

Numbers will ìget worse as this drags on,î said union official Mac Johnson.Sick time ìcall-outs have increased,î TSA spokesman Jim Gregory told The Washington Post.

Previously, the IRS was prohibited from issuing refunds during a shutdown while the majority of employees were on furlough. However, Trump administration lawyers decided it was legally permissible to proceed with processing tax returns. The IRS employees who return to work in order to process these returns will not be paid during the shutdown. Final details are still up in the air, including how many workers will be recalled and when the official tax filing season will begin.PREVIOUSLY: Today we reach the two-week mark of the partial government shutdown, the result of a standoff between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding of a border wall that he originally said Mexico would pay for.In addition to the 420,000 government employees who continue to work without pay, the shutdown has left an estimated 380,000 government workers on furlough, including nearly all Internal Revenue Service employees.So what does that mean for your taxes? As you might have guessed, itís not great news.According to the governmentís shutdown plan, only 12.5 percent of IRS employees are authorized to work during the current ìnon-filing season.î The plan also states that processing certain tax refunds and issuing tax refunds are ìnon-exceptedî activities during this time, meaning that the employees responsible for performing those duties will be furloughed during the shutdown. Jay Williams, a West Virginia-based financial adviser who focuses on tax-advantaged investing, noted there are a few exceptions. Specifically, the government will continue processing of returns that are deemed ìnecessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property.îCurrently, thereís no official plan for how tax returns would be handled in the event that the shutdown extends into tax filing season, which begins Jan. 15 <U+2015> an unprecedented situation, according to Fox Business.So what does this mean for the majority of taxpayers expecting a refund? ìThe government shutdown wonít impact the ability to submit a tax return, but it will impact the issuance of refunds,î said Jeff Fosselman, a certified financial planner, certified public accountant and senior wealth adviser at Relative Value Partners. ìRefunds donít start getting issued until mid-January, so depending on how long the shutdown lasts, this may or may not impact early filers.îWilliams predicts that if shutdown lasts past Jan. 15, the potential delay would be one and a half days for every one day of continued shutdown. ìPast February 1, that delay could balloon to an extra two days per one day of shutdown,î he said.And if the shutdown rolls into March <U+2015> Trump threatened Friday to continue for ìmonths or even yearsî <U+2015> thereís really no telling what could happen. ìPlaying catch-up could be a nightmare for the IRS and consumers,î Williams said, noting that the issue would disproportionately affect Americans in lower-income brackets who count on refunds to pay down debt, save money or simply stay afloat.Hereís the real kicker: Though Uncle Sam could indefinitely dole out IOUs to tax filers awaiting refunds, those who owe taxes will be expected to pony up by the usual deadlines, regardless of whether or not the government is shut down.ìThereís no language in the IRS plan for a shutdown that calls for payments to be withheld or delayed,î Williams said. ìFiling deadlines most certainly still apply, and the IRS takes postmarks very seriously.îEven so, if you have any questions or concerns about how to approach filing your taxes, Williams said you should talk them over with a tax professional.Money, Home and Living Reporter, HuffPost"

And that is paying for the wall. Many, many times over,î Trump said in another rambling, hourlong news conference filled with such falsehoods.ìWhat we save on that just with Mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year, two years, or three years. So I view that as, absolutely, Mexico is paying for the wall,î he claimed.The White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trumpís claims, despite weeks of queries from HuffPost.Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revised NAFTA <U+2015> which Trump has rebranded as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement <U+2015> will not bring into the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. Even more important: What extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by Americans, not Mexico.ìItís not true,î said Monica de Bolle, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, of Trumpís claim. ìWhat it really is is American consumers paying higher prices for stuff. So itís the American consumer whoís paying for the wall, if you want to look at it that way. Itís just total crazyland, and itís only going to get worse.îTrumpís untrue claim about the trade agreement was accompanied by the announcement that he ìmayî declare a national emergency and bypass Congress to build the wall.Trump also confirmed that he told congressional leaders that the two-week-old government shutdown could last months or even more than a year if Congress doesnít give him what he wants.ìI did say that. Absolutely I said that,î he told reporters in a chilly Rose Garden not long after a two-hour meeting with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the minority leaders from both chambers.But he said that if negotiations do not produce the $5.6 billion in border wall funding he is demanding, he can simply spend money on his own. ìWe can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,î he said. ìNo, we can do it. I havenít done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.îWere Trump actually to make such a declaration, though, it would almost certainly draw immediate legal challenges and, in all likelihood, court orders blocking him.ìThe presidentís authority in this area is intended for wars and genuine national emergencies,î said Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the House Appropriations Committeeís Democratic members. ìAsserting this authority to build a wasteful wall is legally dubious and would likely invite a court challenge.îVermont Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy, the vice chairman of the Senate version of that committee, said there was no actual emergency for Trump to declare.ìThere is no national emergency on the southern border.†Between 2000 and 2018, border apprehensions fell sharply from roughly 1.6 million in fiscal year 2000 to approximately 400,000 in fiscal year 2018 <U+2015> thatís a 75 percent drop,î Leahy said in a statement. ìThe president stealing resources from the Defense Department for the construction of a wasteful border wall, at taxpayer expense, to defend against the presidentís imaginary invasion would make our country less safe and the men and women of our military less safe.îFridayís was the second meeting between Trump and the Republican and Democratic congressional leadership this week, but the first since Pelosi formally became speaker with the start of the new Congress. Democrats won 40 seats in the November midterm elections, giving them control of that chamber.Both Trump and Democratic lawmakers said both sides would have staff negotiate through the weekend. Trump said his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence would lead his team.About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money two weeks ago, at midnight on Dec. 21, after Trump reneged on his commitment to sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment even a single time. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars for it <U+2015> even though the structure of what he wants is unclear.During the campaign, he promised a ìgreat, greatî wall made of reinforced concrete that extended so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has said the wall could just be steel slats <U+2015> which would be the ìbollard fencingî that was developed during President Barack Obamaís administration.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

While some federal workers may back the presidentís stance, thereís no evidence that most of them do.Here are some responses HuffPost received from self-identified federal workers:†ìI am a furloughed fed and I do NOT want a god damned fence. I want to go back to work serving the public and getting a paycheck.î <U+2015> federal worker†ìIím really pissed to not be working, but I will be even more pissed if the Dems cave and allow this tantrum to work.î <U+2015>†federal worker in Washington, D.C.ìNeither me,†nor any of my coworkers want any of this wall or this fight.

This is not about a wall, this is about 800,000 real people with real families and real bills to pay.îAFGE has also sued the government over the shutdown, saying itís illegal to make people work without pay. Employees who are considered ìessentialî to the functioning of the government <U+2015> such as air traffic controllers and people who work in law enforcement <U+2015> continue to work during the shutdown but will not get paid until after itís over. Congress will have to pass legislation authorizing back pay for both furloughed employees and those who worked during the shutdown. Trump has said he would support it.†Since about three-quarters of the governmentís funding has already been appropriated by Congress, only certain agencies are closed for the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

We arenít releasing more details.îNPS representatives did not respond to HuffPostís requests for comment. (The NPS has said media lines would also be impacted by the shutdown.)MuÒoz told Outside Magazineís Wes Siler that dispatchers at the Yosemite National Park Emergency Communications Center received a 911 call on the afternoon of Dec. 25 ìregarding a male park visitor with a head injury above Nevada Fall.îìRangers were on scene in less than an hour and the visitor was removed from the water,î MuÒoz said. ìMedical attention was provided to the visitor, but he died from his injuries. The visitor was not in a closed area.îThough national parks have closed during previous government shutdowns, Yosemite is one of numerous sites that remain open but are sorely understaffed right now while parts of the government are shut down.†The NPS typically employs around 800 staff at Yosemite during the winter season, but one ranger at the park told Outside Magazine on Thursday that only about 50 employees were working at the park after the shutdown went into effect at the end of December.MuÒoz did not comment on whether a lack of staffing impacted how quickly rangers reached the man who fell.But CNN reported on Friday that understaffing at national parks would likely impact things like maintenance and cleaning, as well as emergency services.ìFor most parks, there will be no National Park Service-provided visitor services, such as restrooms, trash collection, facilities or road maintenance,î Jeremy Barnum, an NPS spokesman, told the outlet.One hiker at Big Bend National Park broke his leg in a fall and was assisted by other visitors before being intercepted by a park ranger.ìI can only imagine what someone else might be going through right now who needs a service that they canít get,î he told CNN.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Trump has said that he is willing to wait ìas long as it takesî to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises.†A Friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it a ìcontentiousî discussion, but Trump claimed it had been ìproductive.î†His administration has asked for $5.6 billion for the project.Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, ABC News reported†Friday that the president has discussed using funds from the Department of Defense, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal.†The Washington Postís Robert Costa said an unnamed former Trump adviser told the paper that the president was†ìwilling to send the Army Corps of Engineers down to the border and start diggingî if he does not get what he wants.Lawyers from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon are meeting to discuss the legality of using executive power, NBC News reported Friday.†Exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing.

Unless legislators take action by Saturday, the Post reported, the freeze is likely to expire and government executives like Pence could begin receiving raises that would have accumulated due to annual cost-of-living adjustments.The raises may be an intended outcome of the shutdown, as Republicans in November were attempting to tie a pay increase for civilian federal employees to a lift on the pay freeze for top government executives.†President Donald Trump†told lawmakers in August he wanted to scrap the annual pay raise for civilian federal employees, arguing the nationís budget couldnít finance it.Federal workers were poised to receive a 2.1 percent pay increase in January, along with an annual ìlocality pay increase.îìWe must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,î Trump wrote in a letter to House and Senate leaders.Trump in late December went forward on the pay freeze†for federal workers, while the government shutdown was in effect.With the pay cap lifted, Cabinet secretaries could be eligible for an annual salary bump from $199,700 to $210,700, the Post reported. Salaries for deputy secretaries could jump from $179,700 to $189,600. Penceís salary could rise from $230,700 to $243,500.The raises could cost $300 million in taxpayer money over the course of 10 years, the Senior Executives Association told the Post.Roughly 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed since parts of the government shut down last month. Another 400,000 have been forced to work without pay. Democrats quickly passed legislation to reopen the closed government agencies after taking back control of the House on Thursday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed to block the bill, and Trump said he would veto it.Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills, said it was ìoutrageousî that top Trump administration officials could take home raises while other federal employees go without pay.ìAt a time when 800,000 federal employees arenít getting paid, it is absolutely outrageous that the Trump administration would even consider taking advantage of the shutdown to dole out huge raises to the Vice President and its political appointees,î Lowey said in a comment to HuffPost.Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), whose attempt to maintain the pay freeze for top government executives was voted down by House Republicans in June, condemned the potential raises.ìDonald Trump has a long history of shortchanging workers,î McCollum said in a comment to HuffPost. ìWhile the government is shut down and federal employees are going without pay, heís doling out pay raises to his senior political appointees. I find this outrageous. The president must rescind this action, or Congress must work to prohibit it.îThe White House did not immediately offer comment on the potential raises. The governmentís Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget also did not respond to requests for comment.Trump said during remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday he was considering not granting the raises to cabinet members.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that the administration was ìaware of the issueî and was ìexploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.îJacqueline Simon, the policy director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said no federal workers of any rank should be subjected to pay caps.ìWe think it is a good thing salaries for top executives and political appointees will no longer be frozen, but we would expect the administration to abide by the ëofficers eat lastí principle and make sure that rank and file federal employees receive a pay adjustment first,î Simon said in a emailed comment to HuffPost.She added: ìIf pay freezes are wrong for those at the top, then surely they are wrong for those on the front lines, and we urge the President to make sure that everybody gets an adjustment so they can keep up with the cost of living.îThis has been updated to include comment from McCollum and Sanders.CORRECTION:†A previous version of this story indicated that Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) is the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for drafting annual spending bills.

But he reiterated that the meeting was ìproductive,î and said that ìI hope [the shutdown] doesnít go on even beyond a few more days.îTrump claimed that ìweíre all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open,î before announcing that he has convened a group slated to meet ìover the weekend to determine what weíre going to do about the border.îThe president also offered tepid endorsements for a number of potential ideas that could potentially end the shutdown.For one, Trump toyed with supporting the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. He also suggested he could be flexible on what the physical wall structure would be <U+2015> allowing for steel slats instead of a concrete barrier. Both ideas are concessions Democrats could potentially get behind, if they trusted Trump.Itís just that trusting Trump to hold up his end of a bargain is a gigantic leap of faith for Democrats.In his Rose Garden press conference alone, Trump lied multiple times <U+2015> about his past support for a concrete wall, about who is paying for the wall (surprise: itís U.S. taxpayers!), and about the status of a U.S-Mexico trade deal that hasnít passed Congress.If Trump did back DACA, it would still be a sell to Democrats in Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leaders have said that deal is no longer on the table, after Trump rejected it last year. It would take a substantial amount of trust that Trump wouldnít just change his mind and somehow find a way out of DACA, perhaps by offering a new executive order to override the legislation.And even if Trump stood by the immigration program that allows children brought to the United States illegally to stay and obtain work permits, many Republicans inside and outside of Congress would work to undo the legislation in the future.At the same time, the Democratic position that Trump and Republicans must completely cave and fund the government without any concessions doesnít seem realistic either.The partial government shutdown has lasted 14 days as Trump continues to insist on the $5 billion he wants to build his long-promised border wall. Roughly 800,000 federal workers are going without paychecks during the standoff.When asked Friday why he would not just reopen the government and negotiate over the border wall later, Trump said, ìWe wonít be opening until itís solved.îTrump later suggested he could declare a ìnational emergencyî to circumvent Congress to fund the wall.Asked if there were plans to help federal workers who have not gotten paid because of the shutdown, Trump claimed without evidence that they ìare the biggest fan of what we are doing,î and said that ìthe safety net is having a strong border.îThis has been updated.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Most shelters pay their staff, rent and expenses out of pocket, and are repaid with federal funds at the end of each month, Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence explained.The amount of time a shelter can continue operating without federal funds depends on its cash reserves, access to credit lines, and other sources of funding, such as state grants and private donors.ìA lot of shelters operate on the edge,î she said. ìIf there is nobody home in the government to send out reimbursement checks, some programs wonít be able to pay next monthís rent.îOn an average day, over 40,000 victims of domestic violence seek refuge in shelters across the nation. An additional 31,000 receive services, including counseling, legal advocacy and childrenís support groups. Domestic violence programs are funded by a number of federal programs. Not all of them are impacted by the shutdown. But two of the major sources of funding <U+2015> the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Victims of Crime Act Fund <U+2015> are administered through the Department of Justice. The DOJ is now partially closed due to the shutdown.Another source of funding comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development; most of its staff are furloughed. Lisalyn R. Jacobs, an expert in sexual and domestic violence, noted that many domestic violence programs survive paycheck to paycheck, much like many of the clients they serve.In Arkansas, for example, 32 domestic violence shelters serve all 75 counties. Beth Goodrich, the executive direction of the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said a number of those shelters can last only a few weeks before they need to begin laying off staff or even closing up temporarily.Goodrich said she has been fielding phone calls from shelter staff across the state who are anxious about the government shutdown.ìMany of our shelters are at capacity right now,î she said. The biggest concern, she added, was where to send the shelter residents if they had to close or lay off staff.ìThatís a question I donít have an answer for,î Goodrich said. ìWhere are these people going to go?îAccording to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will experience severe physical violence by an intimate partner in her lifetime. An estimated three women a day are killed by their boyfriends, husbands and exes.If the public wants to help ease the current pressure on shelters, they can donate items such as food, diapers and gas cards to their local shelters, Goodrich added.Mariah Stidham Wineski, executive director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said shelters in her state <U+2015> which rely heavily on federal funds to operate <U+2015> knew what to expect with the shutdown after weathering past ones. ìWe did our best to prepare for this, but the longer the shutdown goes on, the more precarious our position becomes,î she said. Wineski was hopeful the shutdown would end soon. ìUntil then we will do our best to juggle money and make it work,î she said. Shelters, which generally provide 24-hour emergency housing, need sufficient staffing around the clock, both for safety reasons and to support their clients, who come with myriad and complex needs. As well as providing a place to stay, domestic violence programs may offer counseling, child care, help finding transitional housing and legal assistance.ìI always like to think of our programs as essential services,î said Tonia Thomas, team coordinator for the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ìI wish more people would think that too.î VAWA, landmark legislation that funds programs for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, also expired when the government shut down on Dec. 22. Advocates believe services will still be funded by Congress until the act is renewed. Thatís what happened the last time VAWA expired in 2011. However, getting VAWA renewed is a huge priority in 2019.Cindy Southworth, executive vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said she was on Capitol Hill on Thursday to greet new members of Congress and impress on them the importance of reopening the government for victims of abuse.ìI explained to them we needed their help to end the government shutdown immediately,î she said. ìBut in addition, I told them we have a vital task ahead of us: to reauthorize a robust and survivor-centered Violence Against Women Act that protects all victims.îCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated which items could be donated to local shelters.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Taking us out of it, mistakes can happen.îOn the day of the shutdown, union leaders with the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists warned that Congress would need to act fast to get inspectors back to work.ìFurloughing this critical workforce during the busy holiday travel season is neither in the best interest of the nationís economy nor the oversight of the U.S. aviation system,î the union said in a statement at the time.†Union leaders at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) are encouraging its members to call their representatives in Congress to ask for an end to the shutdown.This unacceptable government #shutdown is negatively affecting the National Airspace System.

Overtime in the form of six-day weeks and 10-hour days is common at many of the nationís busiest and most short-staffed facilities including radar facilities in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas.†And none of the controllers forced to work during this shutdown will see pay for their hard work to keep travelers safe until the shutdown ends. This shutdown must end now.îTrumpís desperation for a border wall will be further hampered after Democrats took control of the House on Thursday.

The bill is a sweeping combination of election, campaign finance and ethics reforms designed to make voting easier, curb the power of big donors and reduce conflicts of interest in all three branches of government.The For the People Act was the first major legislative action for Democrats after they voted to end the partial government shutdown initiated by President Donald Trump,†a measure he is expected to veto.The package of reforms was put together in a collaborative process initiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in 2011 and overseen by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) since 2017. The party ran in the 2018 midterm elections on a promise to enact these reforms.ìWe carried a message of reform, of fighting corruption, of cleaning up Washington,î Sarbanes said in introducing the bill on Friday. ìWe made a promise to the American people. The new members whoíve come made that promise and made it clear they wanted this to be the first order of business.†[This bill] is delivering on that promise.îThe reforms in the For the People Act would restore the right to vote to millions of disenfranchised Americans and make it dramatically easier for people to vote while also creating a first-of-its-kind public financing system for House elections. It would also require presidential candidates to disclose 10 years of their tax returns.The bill shortly will go to three committees <U+2015> administration, judiciary and oversight <U+2015> for hearings. Democrats hope to pass it through the full House in February.It will then go to the Senate, where a companion bill will be introduced soon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a hard-line opponent of campaign finance and election reforms, promised that the bill will not get a vote.ìThe American people will know that this is an option that the House has given the Senate of the United States and the president of the United States,î Pelosi said on Friday.Here is what is in the Democratsí big reform bill:†(Read the full text here.)The bill includes a requirement that all states automatically register voters who submit paperwork to a state government agency (unless the person opts out), provide same-day voter registration, allow 15 days of early voting with sites located near public transportation, use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to draw new congressional maps, enable online voter registration, count provisional ballots from eligible voters filed at the wrong polling place and use paper ballots in addition to electronic voting systems.It would also ban post-release felon disenfranchisement. This means that about 5 million Americans <U+2015> a disproportionate number of whom are African-American <U+2015> would regain their voting rights once their sentence is completed. The bill would, however, still allow states to disenfranchise felons during their imprisonment.States would be banned from engaging in voter caging, a process in which election officials purge voter rolls by sending out non-forwardable mail and then removing anyone whose mail is returned to sender. It would not be permissible for states to remove someone from the voter rolls for failing to vote in a previous election. The use of interstate cross-checks to purge voter rolls would also be limited under the legislation.Election Day would become a federal holiday for 2 million-plus federal workers, and non-government employers would be encouraged to give the day off to private-sector employees, too. Colleges and universities would be designated as voter registration agencies. Absentee ballots would no longer require postage. And the bill would also increase funding to help states update and secure election infrastructure and to the Election Assistance Commission to oversee these updates, with mandated reports on its progress. The Department of Homeland Security would be ordered to deem election systems as critical infrastructure.Additionally, the bill contains declarations and findings on important issues that Democrats aim to advance in separate legislation. These include findings about the importance of fixing the Voting Rights Act to comply with the Supreme Courtís 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision, which gutted a key section of the historic legislation. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) will introduce this legislation, which will move on a separate track through the committees. The bill also asserts support for statehood for the District of Columbia, protects Native American voting rights and the right to vote in U.S territories.Sarbanes built his reputation as a democracy reform advocate through his work crafting and advocating for legislation to create a system of public financing for congressional elections. The legislative language from his previously introduced bills is the centerpiece of the For the People Actís campaign finance reform section.The bill creates a public financing system for House elections that provides $6 in public funds for every $1 in funds raised from donations up to $200. Participants in this voluntary public financing system would also be prevented from raising money from large donors. The bill also creates a small-donor matching system for presidential elections. A separate bill covering Senate elections will be introduced by Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.).This small-donor-backed public financing system is based on numerous programs adopted around the country, most notably in New York City. The idea is to create an alternative to the funding from big donors and political action committees that currently dominates politics by making it feasible for more candidates to run on small-donor contributions alone.The bill also includes the Disclose Act, which mandates that nonprofits and other groups not currently bound by law to reveal donor information must disclose those sources when they contribute to election campaigns. The packageís Honest Ads Act requires the disclosure of digital political ads on tech platforms.The Federal Election Commission would be reconfigured from six members to five to prevent deadlocks on important issues. The agencyís civil penalty would be made permanent to prevent future legislative battles over its authority. Coordination between super PACs and candidates would be defined in the legislation and banned. Presidential inauguration committees would be required to disclose expenditures and be banned from spending money on anything not related to the actual inauguration. Previously enacted bans on the Securities and Exchange Commission, the executive branch and the Internal Revenue Service from requiring donor disclosure from corporations, nonprofits and government contractors would be repealed.Like the election reform section, the campaign finance reform piece of the bill contains findings on issues Democrats would like to address in separate legislation. This includes a declaration that the Constitution should be amended to overturn not just the Supreme Courtís 2010 Citizens United decision that empowered corporations, unions and the rich to spend unlimited sums on elections, but also the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision that banned Congress from limiting election spending altogether. Additionally, the bill states an intent to ban anonymous shell companies from funding campaigns to prevent the potential for secret foreign money to seep into elections.Every presidential candidate would be required to disclose 10 years worth of tax returns under the bill. The president and the vice president would be required to conduct themselves as though the executive branchís conflict of interest regulations apply to them. Presidential appointees would be required to recuse themselves from any decision in which a party is either the president, the presidentís spouse or any entity in which the president or their spouse has an interest. The president and vice president would be banned from contracting with the U.S. government <U+2015> a provision that would prevent Trump from leasing the Old Post Office Building that houses his D.C. hotel.The Office of Government Ethics would get new enforcement powers. Ethics waivers issued by OGE must be publicly disclosed. OGE must also come up with regulations to govern potential conflicts of interest that arise from the political contributions appointees previously made and received. Presidents-elect would be required to come up with ethics plans to govern their transitions.The bill also features new lobbyist and revolving door reforms to reduce government corruption. Lobbyist registration is extended to anyone ìcounseling in support of lobbying contacts.î This means ex-lawmakers acting as ìconsultantsî for lobbyists would finally have to register as lobbyists. Federal contracting officers would be banned from accepting any compensation from a contractor that they awarded a contract to for two years after leaving office. Senior federal officials would be banned from contacting their former agency to influence employees for two years after their service ends. Foreign agents would be required to disclose anything of value given to an officeholder. And corporations would be prohibited from making incentive payments to anyone entering government service.Supreme Court justices would be required to develop a code of ethics to govern conflicts of interest and recusals. Members of Congress would be banned from using taxpayer funds to settle employment discrimination cases. Lawmakers would be banned from serving on corporate boards and from using their position to help the financial interests of themselves or their immediate families.Democrats see passage of the For the People Act as necessary to keep the promise that they made in the 2018 election to voters to fix democracy and root out corruption in Washington.The new House Democratic class that pushed the party into power in the 2018 election ran on a message of reform. More than 100 Democratic candidates, many of whom now sit in Congress, sent a letter to the House†in October demanding the first order of business be the passage of campaign finance and electoral reforms.ìThis package is really a great place for us to start in keeping all of the promises we made on the campaign trail,î freshman Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) said.ìThe overall message is one that I hope will show voters that Democrats and many Republican allies who join us in this effort are trying to restore faith in the democratic process and in our government,î freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) added.This article has been updated to include Sarbanesí comments.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

In 2013, the agency leased the property for 60 years to the Trump Organization. That agreement noted that the property could not be leased to an ìelected official of the Government of the United States,î but the GSA determined the deal was in ìfull complianceî because Trump had agreed not to accept direct payments from the hotel.According to the†lease, Trump Hotels must preserve public access to the tower and maintain the entire Post Office site.ìFor the avoidance of doubt, the Clock Tower Space is part of the Premises ... for which Tenant is responsible,î the lease states.The website for the Trump International Hotel touts the ìClock Tower observation deck with panoramic views of the capital cityî as one of the ìhotel highlights.îThe hotel is at the center of an emoluments case against the president. The emoluments clause of the Constitution bars federal officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign officials or governments.†The case, filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C., accuses Trump of skirting the prohibition with the hotel where they contend foreign leaders can curry favor with the president via pricey bookings and parties.A spokesman for the Department of the Interior told E&E that the parks service was attempting to keep ìiconic areasî†open during the shutdown, but that did not include the tower ó until the GSA stepped in.†This story has been updated to include a working link for the NPS page on the clock tower.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?

We will have no deal without a wall.îThe partial government shutdown, which began shortly before Christmas, is stretching into its third week with no end in sight. House Democrats under the leadership of newly elected Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), passed legislation meant to reopen closed agencies, but those efforts have already been deemed dead on arrival by Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has said he would block any bill without first obtaining President Donald Trumpís approval, and Trump has refused to back down from his demand that a government spending bill include the $5.6 billion for the wall.Pence on Thursday repeatedly said the White House was willing to negotiate with the Democrats to sort out some kind of compromise, although he said there would be no deal without funding for some sort of barrier along the Mexico border.ìWe really are prepared to negotiate, weíre prepared to talk, weíre prepared to listen,î the vice president said. ìI want the American people to know that this is a real crisis at our border, and we made progress last year.îCongressional leaders from both parties are expected to meet with Trump at the White House again on Friday.Some GOP senators began to break with their party on Thursday, however, and urged McConnell to consider compromising on legislation even if Trump didnít get immediate funding for border security. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) told The Hill that the chamber should pass a continuing resolution, a stop-gap funding measure, to ìget the government back open.îìWe can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more, but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open,î he told the outlet.Sen.

Neither the White House switchboard nor the call-in phone line to leave recorded comments is functioning because of the government shutdown. ìWe apologize, but due to the lapse in federal funding, we are unable to take your call,î a recorded message on the switchboard states.But no poll has found that a majority of Americans support the wall or funding for the wall, or see it as a priority.A Quinnipiac poll of 1,147 voters reached on landlines or cell phones from Dec. 12-17 found that 54 percent of respondents opposed the wall and 43 percent supported it. A Harvard CAPS/Harris online survey†of 1,407 registered voters conducted Dec. 24-26† found that 56 percent of those surveyed did not support a wall, while 44 percent did.Just 35 percent of those surveyed supported including money for the wall in a federal spending bill, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,440 adults conducted online Dec. 21-25.More than two-thirds of Americans donít think the wall should be a priority, according to†a poll of 1,075 adults by NPR, PBS News Hour and Marist. That poll was conducted Nov. 28-Dec. 4 using live telephone interviews to reach both landlines and cell phones.†Regardless of Americansí opinions about the wall,†theyíre not happy with how the government shutdown is being handled by either Congress or Trump. Just 18 percent of Americans polled say they approve of how Congress has handled the shutdown, with 60 percent disapproving, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey†finds. As for Trump, 38 percent approve of how heís handling it, and 49 percent disapprove, according to the poll.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing to block the bill and President Donald Trump saying he would veto it.The partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with Democrats now controlling one chamber of Congress, thereís no sign of any deal.Democrats are more determined than ever not to give Trump a single dollar for his border wall, and Trump hasnít moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (Thereís an ongoing semantics battle over ìborder security,î ìsteel slats,î ìfencing,î and a ìwallî that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)Thereís also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. Sean Hannity, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but Democrats have also said they now wouldnít accept that deal, partly because they donít trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.A DACA deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if Democrats decided to trust Trump. Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are set to attend another White House meeting with Trump on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.On Thursday, House Democrats passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for the Department of Homeland Security that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October. The short-term bill for DHS passed the House 239-192, with five Republicans breaking ranks to join all Democrats in support of the bill.The House also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yes.The Republican defections <U+2015> contrasted with Democratic unity <U+2015> are the first signs of the GOP cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), whoís up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.But aside from a few Republicans, the GOP is digging in. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) <U+2015> a member who speaks with Trump on a regular basis <U+2015> told HuffPost on Thursday that the shutdown wouldnít end until Democrats approved wall money. ìI mean, thereís a wall between Tijuana and San Diego, right? If itís so bad or immoral as they say, youíd think theyíd be willing to tear them down,î Jordan said.Jordan is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesnít include Trumpís full request, but one of the byproducts of Democrats taking back the House is that Jordanís vote is irrelevant. As Democrats proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the Senate to act and the president to sign it <U+2015> two things that remain unlikely.McConnell once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the Senate unanimously two weeks ago a ìwaste of time.î He says he wonít allow a vote on anything ìthat does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature.îLeaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesnít have a real chance of passing, the House and Senate could always override Trumpís veto, but that would require a significant number of Republicans to break ranks <U+2015> more than two dozen in the Senate and around 50 in the House.Politically, thatís a tall order for the GOP, a party that seems to value fealty to Trump above all else. But the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week <U+2015> looking more likely by the day <U+2015> it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.For Democrats, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. Itís almost a representation of Trumpís entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. Democrats donít want to give in to Trump on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that Democrats give him what he wants.ìWeíre not doing the wall,î Pelosi told reporters Thursday night. ìDoes anybody have any doubt? Weíre not doing the wall.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Instead of throttling legislation that is popular with the general public but makes Trump and Republicans look bad, she will pass it, and dare the Senate and Trump to oppose it.ìI donít think the president or his team fully appreciate how miserable having a House Democratic majority will be,î said one Republican consultant on condition of anonymity.†A former White House official said Trumpís daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had told the president that a Pelosi speakership would actually be good for him.ìHeís only now realizing that Javanka misled him,î the official said, also on condition of anonymity and using a nickname for the couple.Trump made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon to congratulate Pelosi and to predict he would work well with her. ìI think itís actually going to work out. I think it will be a little bit different than what a lot of people are thinking,î Trump said.Ramesh Ponnuru, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, remained unpersuaded. He said that Trumpís White House seems to understand the threat posed by Democratsí new ability to investigate using congressional hearings and subpoenas, but ìit seems like they havenít given much thought to the legislative headachesî Pelosi could cause.If Trump demands legislation important to him, Pelosi and Democrats could counter it with something they want.If Trump pushes restrictions on immigration, as he has in the past, House Democrats could pass the comprehensive immigration bill that cleared the Senate in 2013, which includes a path to citizenship for those who entered this country illegally.If Trump insists on funding for his border wall, Democrats could agree to pass it on the condition that the bill also include protection for special counsel Robert Muellerís investigation of Trump. Or a requirement that all presidential candidates produce 10 years of tax returns. Or both.Democrats could also bring to the floor and pass proposals that are popular generally but that traditionally have been opposed by Republicans ó and thereby force House Republicans to take a public stand on them.ìJust increasing the minimum wage is an issue thatís popular and that splits Trumpís coalition,î Ponnuru said.The new Democratic House majority will likely not have much effect on Trumpís own legislative agenda, primarily because he has not had much of one.While Trump likes to boast about the tax cut bill, legislation rolling back regulations and his appointment of a record number of conservative appeals court judges, in reality, all of those likely would have happened with any Republican president working with a Republican Congress. The uniquely ìTrumpianî elements of his agenda ó such as cutting back on legal immigration or backing out of trade agreements ó have not received much support at all from congressional Republican leaders in either chamber.ìHe didnít need or want much. He didnít ask in a serious way for much. And he didnít get much,î Ponnuru said.In any event, Republicansí bigger concern now is the legislation originating in Pelosiís House. Raising the minimum wage, protecting Mueller, requiring tax returns of presidential candidates and offering a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, particularly those brought into the country as children, are all popular among the general public but have been blocked by Republican House leaders in the past.When those or similar bills pass the House, the only thing stopping them from passing Congress could well be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.ìAll eyes should be on Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell understands the implications of House Democratic control even though the White House doesnít,î said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. ìMcConnellís full-time role is going to be preventing legislation from getting to the president.îItís a role he has already started playing. When Pelosi announced that the first legislation to pass under her leadership would be bills ending the partial government shutdown ó bills that had already won strong Republican support in the Senate last year ó McConnell quickly responded that he would not bring them to the floor because Trump would not sign them.In an interview with CNN, McConnell said he was waiting for Trump to come to an agreement with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, since he needs seven Democratic votes to pass legislation. ìSo, I havenít been sidelined,î McConnell said. ìItís just that thereís no particular role for me when you have this setup.îJolly said he is not sure that explanation will pass the straight-face test with bills that clearly have enough bipartisan support to pass McConnellís chamber. ìThere will be a moment when the votes are there in the Senate, and McConnell doesnít let it pass,î he said.Stan Collender, who for decades worked on Capitol Hill as a budget committee staffer, said that dynamic could be a dangerous one for Trump. ìLooks like McConnell is willing to take the bullet for Trump so far,î Collender said. ìIf and when that changes, this will become a real shit show for the White House. That will be the real loss of the Trump base.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). And President Donald Trump may find that his playbook for dealing with women ó a classic sexist mixture of paternalism, leering and straight-up name-calling and misogyny, sprinkled with the occasional nondisclosure agreement ó isnít going to work against this unprecedented female offense. The female forces aligned against Trump involve more than Pelosi, who on Thursday officially became the most powerful female politician in the country (again). Heíll have to contend with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) the new chair of the House Financial Services Committee. She said that looking at Trumpís finances will be on the to-do list. Thereís also savvy and vocal opposition coming from freshmen like Rep.†Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).And then thereís a clutch of women in the Senate, all gearing up for a presidential run. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was first out of the gate this week; but expect Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to provide a steady stream of criticism, well.ìHeís going to have powerful, competent women coming at him in all directions,î said Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia.Trumpís go-to strategy of name-calling and ad hominem attacks is not going to work against this onslaught, she said. Calling these women weak, suggesting he can ruin their careers ó all strategies heís done with men he doesnít respect ó will be an instant reminder of the presidentís sexism. ìIf he wants to avoid daily reminders of the ëAccess Hollywoodí tape, then he canít deal with these powerful female adversaries the same way heís accustomed to dealing with powerful male adversaries,î Lawless said.Of course, Trump has had to face off with powerful women before, but typically these were one-offs. In the race against Hillary Clinton, already the subject of a good portion of the countryís hatred, he was able to tap the misogynist well. He was successful in demeaning Warren by calling her Pocahontas. His strategy with Angela Merkel? Ignore. At one event, Trump notably avoided making eye contact.The difference this time is heís outnumbered. And thatís crucial. Having more women in power makes a real difference when it comes to battling sexism ó thatís true in the boardroom, where itís generally recognized that you need at least three female directors in order to have truly meaningful diversify. And itís true in politics, too. Alone, one woman can do a little to combat sexism, but together, a diverse group can break through insidious stereotypes and take on men like Trump ó whoíve spent their careers ignoring women. Pelosi gets this.ìHave you ever been to a meeting when youíre at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say, ëThatís a great ideaí?î Pelosi asked CNNís Dana Bash recently.The whole listening to women thing will hopefully be less of a problem now that there are so many women in Congress, Pelosi told The New York Times. The 78-year-old congresswoman†has been training her whole life for this moment ó beginning her career in Congress as only one of 23 women in the House, wrangling power away from a bunch of men who werenít exactly itching to mentor her.She isnít here to coddle the president, as the women in his orbit tend to do.†Indeed, one of the only high-ranking women in the Trump administration calls the President ìdad.îAnd Pelosi wonít be cowed by his insults. ìI know how to take a punch,î she told Bash. ìI put on a suit of armor, eat nails for breakfast.îWe got a taste of how she handles Trump at the end of last year, when she swooped into the Oval Office for a meeting that was supposed to be a photo op and turned into a Democratic public relations coup when she and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) got Trump to take credit for the government shutdown that is currently in its 12th day.At the meeting, available in its entirety on C-SPAN, she dismantled Trump who tried his best to only talk to the men in the room (another tactic heís used with powerful women).Pelosi chided him at one point by saying, ìdonít characterize the strength that I bring.î Those words are now immortalized on a T-shirt in her office, the Times reported. Her armor that day was a red Max Mara coat that became instantly iconic. Today, she got more than a coat <U+2015> she took up the gavel. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Part of the reason Republicans were able to win back the House majority in 2010 was through a ìFire Pelosiî campaign that made her toxic in some Republican-leaning districts, and Republicans have run on a similar playbook for every election since, including in 2018.A number of freshman Democrats made promises during the campaign to not support Pelosi if they were elected to Congress, and 10 stood by that vow, voting either ìpresentî or for someone else.But Pelosi was able to quell a revolt from about a dozen and a half Democrats who were already in Congress. She was able to frame the opposition as misogynist. (Her supporters started the hashtag #FiveWhiteGuys to describe the opposition, even though it wasnít only white men opposing her and there were more than five.)She picked off individual members through small promises. (She got the vote of Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio by promising to bring back a subcommittee on elections and make her the chairwoman, and she got Rep. Brian Higgins of New York simply by publishing a statement supporting his Medicare buy-in idea.)And she swung a large chunk of detractors through a deal where she stated her support of term limits for leadership roles and committee chairmen. (The deal set up Pelosi to not only serve this term as speaker but to serve next term as speaker if Democrats hold onto the House.)It was a classic demonstration of her skill as a legislator. She outworked her opponents. She wore them down, made it uncomfortable to oppose her, and then offered a carrot for their support. And by giving the smallest concession, Pelosi actually solidified her future position. If she serves the next two terms as the No. 1 Democrat in the House, she will have spent 20 years in that position and practically assured through rule changes that no one else could ever do the same.Pelosi takes the speakership from Republican Paul Ryan, who exited the building entirely in deciding not to run for re-election, during a partial government shutdown. The fitting end to Ryanís speakership is a political gift to Pelosi, as Democrats are able to unify around her opposition to President Donald Trump and his border wall. The first order of business for Democrats is to pass legislation reopening those closed agencies.Pelosi has already shown her mettle with Trump during this shutdown. She has been resolute that Democrats wonít approve any money for Trumpís border wall, and sheís positioned Democrats to hammer the president and Senate Republicans for their refusal to take up a bill that passed the Senate unanimously weeks before.During an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), she and Schumer were able to goad Trump into taking the blame for a shutdown <U+2015> a sound bite that continues to haunt Trump as the shutdown stretches into its second week.As House Democrats address legislation to end the shutdown, they are also set to take up unifying anti-corruption legislation before facing any of the real fault lines in their caucus. Democrats donít plan to immediately demand Trumpís tax returns, as they could in the Ways and Means Committee. They donít have any plans to impeach the president, though some members plan to offer articles of impeachment on Day One. And they wonít be taking up contentious health care legislation any time soon. Pelosi was able to head off a small revolt on the rules package. Some progressive members didnít want ìpay as you goî rules enacted in Congress, for hope of passing a Medicare-for-all bill, but the rules package is expected to easily be adopted later Thursday.Pelosi, the only woman to ever serve as speaker, takes the gavel after serving eight years as minority leader, with four years as speaker before that and another four years <U+2015> from 2003 to 2007 <U+2015> as the minority leader previously.

On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.ìThey are now feeling the heat,î Schumer said.Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.ìWeíre asking the president to open the government,î she told reporters on the White House driveway. ìWe are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that?îSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees <U+2015> about half furloughed, half deemed ìessentialî and required to work anyway <U+2015> face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, ìAs long as it takes,î†calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of ìnational security.îTrumpís comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattisí performance and the late Sen. John McCainís vote against Trumpís repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.Trumpís remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it <U+2015> even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.During the campaign, he promised a ìgreat, greatî wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the ìbollard fencingî developed during President Barack Obamaís administration.In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trumpís claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the government shutdown?†Email us about it.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) revealed he would support President Donald Trumpís proposed border wall one day after publishing an opinion piece in The Washington Post critiquing nearly everything about the current administration.ìI would vote for the border wall,î Romney, former Republican presidential candidate, told CNNís Jake Tapper in a Wednesday afternoon interview.ìWe should have a wall on the southern border,î the former governor of Massachusetts added.While he considers the government shutdown <U+2015> which has gone on for nearly two weeks <U+2015> an ìunfortunateî situation, Romney did not directly criticize it. Trump has pledged to continue the shutdown for ìas long as it takesî to secure federal funding for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, which would come with a multibillion-dollar price tag, even though the president has previously said that Mexico would pay for it.The senator-elect appears willing to fall in line with Trump over his most divisive campaign promise, even though he believes the president is causing ìdismay around the worldî and tension in America, as he wrote for The Post in the piece published Tuesday morning.ìIt is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination. After he became the nominee, I hoped his campaign would refrain from resentment and name-calling. It did not,î Romney wrote.†ìHis conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.îThe senator-elect lamented the recent departures of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.He also pledged to ìspeak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,î he wrote.The wall has been criticized as a symbol of racism that would not effectively stop people without documents from crossing the border.For the op-ed, Romney earned a rebuttal from Trump, who floated a comparison to outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who nonetheless largely voted in line with the presidentís policies.ìI won big, and he didnít,î the president wrote, appearing to reference Romneyís failed 2012 campaign.†ìBe a TEAM player & WIN!î†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Even though the Senate unanimously passed a clean continuing resolution at the end of December <U+2015> a stopgap spending bill extending operations without border wall money <U+2015> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has vowed not to bring up another bill in this new Congress until thereís agreement from Trump.House Democrats will be able to argue that McConnell and Trump are standing in the way of paychecks for an estimated 800,000 federal workers <U+2015> more than half of whom are simply working without pay. Typically, Congress approves back pay for those furloughed workers, but government contractors will likely get nothing.As Washington <U+2015> and the rest of the United States <U+2015> comes back from its holiday break, pressure to end the shutdown may grow. Americans already blame Trump more for the shutdown than Democrats, by a margin of 47 percent to 33 percent. And if the shutdown stretches on so long that Americans start feeling the effects <U+2015> like delayed tax refunds because of a shuttered IRS, or missed flights because of TSA workers striking <U+2015> Trump and other Republicans may start getting desperate.Trump said Wednesday that it could be a ìlong timeî before the closed government agencies are reopened.The president vows to keep the shutdown going as long as Democrats donít give him money for his border wall, but heís shown no willingness to negotiate on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program, and Democrats have shown little willingness to give Trump even one dollar. The distance between the two sides seems to be growing, as Trump reneged on a deal Vice President Mike Pence offered last week that would have delivered $2.5 billion for the wall, instead of the $5.6 billion Trump wants. Trump said Wednesday that he wouldnít accept just $2.5 billion.Trump met with Democratic leaders on Wednesday at the White House, but there was once again no real movement.Instead of cutting a hasty deal, Democrats seem more satisfied to demonstrate that itís Trump and Republicans standing in the way of a funded government. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who represents many federal employees in northern Virginia, said he was confident Democrats could wait the president out.ìI donít know what leverage he has that he can exercise,î Connolly told HuffPost on Wednesday. ìThey started off with $5.5 billion or else. And weíre now down to anything with a 2.îIn the spending bills Democrats plan to pass on Thursday, the February date for DHS funding would serve to continue negotiations. Some Republicans in the House may end up voting for the bill, and thereís a possibility that if the shutdown drags on for long enough, Senate Republicans could pass the bill and both chambers could override Trumpís veto.Democrats initially planned to make their first legislation in the majority a package of anti-corruption, campaign finance and democracy reform bills. That will now be the second item on their agenda, after funding the government, though they are still calling the anti-corruption package ìH.R. 1î and plan to pass that bill later on Thursday.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It is not fair,î a Transportation Security Administration employee told HuffPost.Without staffing, national parks like Yosemite in California and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado are being overwhelmed with trash and vandalism.

Money for Trumpís pet project, a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, has been the sticking point in passing budgets for several government departments.The briefing is scheduled for 3 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, the day before Democrats are to assume control of the House and end the Republican monopoly on government.The exact agenda was not immediately clear, according to a person with knowledge of the briefing who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the top incoming House Republicans ó Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana ó planned to attend, aides said. The departing House speaker, Paul Ryan, was not expected.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become speaker on Thursday, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer planned to attend. Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats would take action to ìend the Trump shutdownî by passing legislation Thursday to reopen government.ìWe are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,î she wrote in a letter to colleagues. ìSenate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the presidentís third shutdown of his term.ìThe White House invitation came Tuesday after House Democrats released their plan to re-open the government without approving money for a border wall ó unveiling two bills to fund shuttered government agencies and put hundreds of thousands of federal workers back on the job. They planned to pass them as soon as the new Congress convenes Thursday.Responding to the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Tuesday night called it a ìnon-starterî and said it wonít re-open the government ìbecause it fails to secure the border and puts the needs of other countries above the needs of our own citizens.ìTrump spent the weekend saying Democrats should return to Washington to negotiate, firing off Twitter taunts. After aides suggested there would not necessarily be a traditional wall as Trump had described since his presidential campaign, Trump stated that he really still wanted to build a border wall.On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Yearís message to ìEVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,î Trump tweeted: ìThe Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.ìBut he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi. ìBorder Security and the Wall ëthingí and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Letís make a deal?î he tweeted.Whether the Republican-led Senate would consider the Democratic bills ó or if Trump would sign either into law ó was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trumpís backing.ìItís simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he wonít sign,î Stewart said.Even if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president. At the same time, administration officials said Trump was in no rush for a resolution to the impasse.Trump believes he has public opinion on his side and, at very least, his base of supporters behind him, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels ó with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than the $5 billion Trump has said he wants for the wall ó through Feb. 8 as talks continued.It would also include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. It would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.___Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

At the same time, the number of visitors surged because thereís no one to collect admission fees.Now areas and entire parks are being closed because of garbage, human waste ó and snow. Arches and Canyonlands in Utah and other areas have been closed because thereís no money for plowing. Utah had been paying to staff up all five of its national parks but will continue to staff only Zion in the new year, AP reported.Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado has locked its restrooms and trash bins ìdue to human waste issues, wildlife concerns and overall public health,î a notice on the park website said.

Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!Trump is now claiming that ìsavingsî from an updated NAFTA agreement with Mexico will pay for the wall, but how that would work remains a mystery.Trumpís contradictions and flip-flops are complicating any compromise that would end the partial shutdown of the government, which began Dec. 22.Outgoing chief of staff John Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview last week that the idea of a concrete wall was dropped by the administration early in 2018 for a fence or another kind of barrier. ìTo be honest, itís not a wall,î Kelly said. Trump spoke of ìbeautiful steel slats,î rather than a wall, in mid-December. On the night Trump refused to sign a spending measure without funds for a wall, triggering the shutdown, he posted a video calling for a ìwall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it.î†On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) said that the wall is simply a ìmetaphorî for border security, which would involve a ìbarrier where it makes sense.îBut Trump doubled down on his campaign-promised concrete wall on Monday, saying the idea of an ìall-concrete wallî has ìnever been abandoned.îAn all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!As for funding, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) made a point recently about that:THEN:Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico. Mexico.

Instead, he canceled his 16-day golfing vacation and spent the final day of 2018 at the White House, posting angry tweets about Democrats, who are refusing to agree to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.ìIím in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall,î Trump wrote.What else Trump did at the White House on Monday, apart from watching television, is not readily apparent. The White House press office stopped disseminating his public schedule two weeks ago and did not respond to HuffPost queries about Trumpís activities.Since the shutdown, Trump has been blaming Democrats. Nevertheless, it was the president himself who brought about the partial government shutdown by reneging on his agreement to sign a short-term spending bill to fund the quarter of the federal government that wasnít covered by earlier bills he had already signed into law.Trump reversed course after Fox News and radio talk show hosts ridiculed him for caving on his campaign promise to build a border wall. Trump insisted the new spending plan include $5 billion for the wall ó even though he had promised hundreds of times during his campaign that his ìgreat, greatî wall would not cost Americans anything because he would force Mexico to pay for it.That left some 800,000 federal government employees in paycheck limbo. About half were furloughed when funding for their agencies ran out at midnight Dec. 21; the other half were deemed ìessentialî and forced to work anyway. None will receive another paycheck until Trump has signed a bill resuming funding.When that might take place is unclear. Trump has vowed he will not accept any measure that does not include billions for his wall ó although the precise nature of that wall is now unknown ó while Democrats say they are not interested in spending U.S. taxpayer money on a project Trump had promised he would make Mexico finance.Republicans still control both the House and Senate, but Trump has focused his attacks on Democrats. Because Republicans only have 51 seats in the Senate, they need at least nine Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation in that chamber.The Democratsí position only gets stronger on Thursday, when California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi is set to become the next speaker after her party picked up 40 seats and control of the House in the November midterm elections.Her plan is to pass a spending package of bills that already cleared the Senate appropriations committee to provide full-year funding for most of the affected agencies, and also a two-month extension for the Department of Homeland Security. The idea of a short-term extension for all of the unfunded agencies was considered so uncontroversial that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell brought it to the floor for a voice vote, where it passed unanimously on Dec. 19.Those votes of approval from Senate Republicans, though, will carry no weight with McConnell now, a top aide said Monday. ìItís simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he wonít sign,î said Don Stewart.Should McConnell refuse to take up those bills after the Democratic House passes them, that will prove he is merely a rubber stamp for Trump and his whims, Democrats said.ìThen they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workersí paychecks hostage over the wall,î Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The union said withholding the pay of workers who continue to clock in during the shutdown runs afoul of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Great Depression-era law establishing a minimum wage and overtime pay.ìThis is not an acceptable way for any employer, let alone the U.S. government, to treat its employees,î Heidi Burakiewicz, a lawyer representing the workers, said in a statement. ìThese employees still need to pay childcare expenses, buy gas, and incur other expenses to go to work every day and yet, they are not getting paid. It is a blatant violation.îSome 380,000 federal employees have been furloughed during the shutdown, meaning they are out of a job until lawmakers reach a funding agreement. But another 420,000 are continuing to work in ìessentialî capacities such as in law enforcement, but are not being paid.After previous shutdowns, Congress has passed legislation to retroactively pay furloughed employees and those who worked through the closures. But in the meantime, all those workers have bills to pay. Those who donít have deep enough savings will face some hard choices if the shutdown continues to grind on.AFGE previously sued the government under the same claims after the 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days. A judge later ruled that around 25,000 workers were owed double pay due to damages.Unlike that earlier shutdown, the ongoing one affects only about one-quarter of federal functions, as Congress has already appropriated money for the rest. One of the main agencies hit by this shutdown is the Department of Homeland Security. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include transportation security officers, border patrol agents and correctional officers, among others who are continuing to work. J. David Cox, the president of AFGE, said in a statement that such workers ìdeserve the decency of knowing when their next paycheck is coming.î Cox added that the intent of the lawsuit was ìto force the government and the administration to make all federal employees whole.îThe shutdown began on Dec. 22, after President Donald Trump demanded more than $5 billion for a wall along the southern U.S. border, which he originally said Mexico was going to pay for. Democrats take over as the new House majority on Thursday, giving the party a stronger hand in the standoff. Democratic lawmakers said they will unveil a plan to reopen the government immediately, although House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker, has said the party will not acquiesce to Trumpís demand for the wall money.

Although Trump has said that federal workers want him to hold out in shutdown negotiations until he gets his way, the TSA employees who talked with HuffPost had a very different message.ìWhile Congress and Mr. Trump get to stay home, enjoy their personal time with their families, and still get paid, we have to struggle and suffer,î a Transportation Security Officer told HuffPost in an email. The officer, a single mother, now worries how sheíll take care of her kids if the shutdown drags on.ìMost of us live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to be unpaid and still go to work for long. It is not fair,î she said.A prolonged shutdown could mean missed rent or mortgage payments, no gas money to get to airports and pressure to look for a new job or take on extra work, TSA employees said. The fact this is the third shutdown in under a year adds to the frustration. Several workers criticized the government for playing politics with peopleís lives.ìTo say morale is low is an understatement. People on both sides of the political argument are infuriated at this,î another TSA officer said. ìWe feel completely and utterly unappreciated.îFor some employees, the treatment of the TSA reinforced the feeling that the agency is the ìbastard stepchildî of the federal government. TSA employees, for instance, are not part of the same General Schedule salary system as other federal workers that gives clearly defined grades of pay and steps for advancement <U+2015> annual pay for TSA officers starts at around $25,000 to $30,000 a year. Several employees brought up the possibility that a long shutdown would lead to departures, either out of necessity or from growing discontent at the job. †ìThe turnover rate of employees is very high in this agency and for good reason, as it is easy to lose our sense of purpose when we are being shit on from all sides,î one officer said. Other employees worried that theyíd face backlash from management if they called out of work during the shutdown, even if it was because they couldnít afford the transportation costs of getting to and from the airport.ìI know that may sound unreasonable but with our management itís very predictable,î a TSA officer said about facing disciplinary action if workers took time off.Federal employees are expected to receive back pay once the government reopens, but with no fixed date and bills to pay in the meantime it is little comfort for workers who are currently on the job without compensation. The shutdown, which is now in its 10th day, is almost certain to stretch into the new year. The White House and top Democrats are at an impasse over Trumpís demand for money to build his border wall with Mexico <U+2015> one of his best known campaign promises, which he claimed Mexico would pay for. Neither side appears ready to compromise, and the Democrats are set to take control of the House when Congress reconvenes this week.The effects of the shutdown will become increasingly apparent if no deal is reached. Major tourist attractions and cultural institutions such as the Smithsonian and National Zoo will stop running this week, while many national parks are closed. But if empty museums and service stations are the most visible signs of the shutdown, workers say theyíre the ones who are facing the worst of the crisis.ìThereís very little attention on the people affected,î said one TSA employee. ìYeah, offices are closed, parks are closed, but thereís a bunch of us, a bunch of people.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

It was ultimately made possible by Congress, which never passed a pay hike before the end of the year. The GOP-controlled Senate had signed off on a bipartisan 1.9 percent increase, but the GOP-controlled House left it unaddressed.If Trump had done nothing, the federal pay formula would have enacted an automatic 2.1 percent pay increase. But the inaction by Congress gave him an opening to make the increase zero through executive order.Itís likely that the House will agree to a pay raise after Democrats take over as the majority on Jan. 3. Federal employee unions will press for any raise to be retroactive to the first of the year if an increase gets passed.Groups representing federal employees said Trumpís freeze comes as added insult to the shutdown. Roughly one-fourth of the federal government is not funded at the moment, as the president demands $5 billion in federal funds for a wall along the southern border that he used to say Mexico was going to pay for.Roughly 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed and are temporarily out of a job. Although lawmakers have typically approved backpay retroactively after previous shutdowns, there is no guarantee a divided Congress would do so this time.NARFE, a group representing current and retired federal workers, said the implementation of the pay freeze is another sign of Trumpís ìdisdainî for government employees.ìRefusing to provide a nominal raise for our nationís hardworking federal employees amid a partial government shutdown shows clear contempt for those who carry out public service,î Ken Thomas, the groupís president, said in a statement.Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 federal workers, said Trump was ìpouring salt into the woundî while workers go without paychecks. As HuffPost reported Thursday, the partial shutdown is just the latest chapter in Trumpís long-running battle with civil servants who do the governmentís work. In addition to the pay freeze, his administration has also tried to peel back collective bargaining rights and increase workersí pension contributions. Many workers and their representatives bristle at middle-class government employees being lumped in with the ìswampî that Trump said needs draining.ìItís almost as if we have an administration that is at war with its own workforce,î one union official told HuffPost earlier this week. ìItís been an ongoing assault.î Trump has warned that the shutdown could drag on îfor a very long time<U+2033> if he doesnít get the wall money he wants. Democrats have said they will produce a bill to reopen the government as soon as they take over the House next week, but so far they have shown few signs of acquiescing to the presidentís demands.Members of the military are not subject to the pay freeze. They will be receiving a 2.6 percent pay increase next year, even though Trump falsely told them to their faces that they would be getting 10 percent.HuffPost readers: Are you affected by the shutdown?

He was the second child to die in government custody this month, following 7-year-old Jakelin Caal from Guatemala, who died on Dec. 8.†Prior to the deaths, no child had died in Customs and Border Patrol custody for more than a decade, according to CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan.†Over the past two years, the Trump administration has strived to crack down on asylum-seekers at the border.ìAny deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They canít,î Trump wrote Saturday afternoon.He added: ìIf we had a Wall, they wouldnít even try!îAny deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They canít. If we had a Wall, they wouldnít even try! The two........children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadnít given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!Trump also falsely claimed that the deceased 7-year-oldís father ìsaid it was not their fault,î referring to immigration authorities. While the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the father told them he had not been able to give his daughter food or water for ìdays,î the family has called for an ìobjective and thorough investigationî into the incident. The father also said the girl was healthy before arriving in the U.S.The presidentís comments are in line with his administrationís prior statements denying any culpability for children who die in U.S. custody.ìDoes the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country? No,î White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said earlier this month.†Trump echoed that sentiment on Saturday, claiming that his proposed border wall would deter migrants from impoverished Central American countries from seeking asylum in the U.S.However, most of the people living in the U.S. illegally do so by simply overstaying legally obtained visas, the Center for Migration studies reported last year. The massive infrastructure projectís would-be effectiveness is debated.Trump has not yet backed down from his fight to secure funding for the wall, which led to a partial government shutdown that started last week†and will almost certainly extend into the new year.CORRECTION:†A previous version of this story misstated the day Trump made his statements as Sunday.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

First lady Melania Trump flew to Palm Beach via Air Force jet Thursday, and his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both White House advisers, were spotted there earlier in the week.Donald Trumpís incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told Fox News on Friday morning that the president would remain in Washington. ìHeís canceled his plans for Christmas. Now heís canceled his plans for New Yearís,î Mulvaney said.At the same time, though, Mulvaney and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the shutdown is continuing into its second week only because House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would endanger her expected return to the speakership if she cut a deal with Trump before that election on Jan. 3.ìNancy Pelosi is only looking to protect her speakership, and not protect our borders,î Sanders told CBS News.That coordinated messaging could be laying the groundwork for Trumpís eventual travel to Mar-a-Lago in time to attend his party, with the rationale that he can just as effectively wait for Pelosi to become speaker in Florida as he can in Washington.ìWe shouldnít be amazed by anything,î said Eisen, whose group is suing to get access to Mar-a-Lagoís visitor logs. ìOne thing we have learned from Trump is that he defies the conventional wisdom even when itís completely self-destructive.îPelosiís office, meanwhile, ridiculed the White Houseís attempt to blame her. ìDemocrats are united against the presidentís immoral, ineffective and expensive wall ó the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for,î said Pelosi aide Drew Hammill. ìDemocrats have made it clear that, given that the president has changed his position so many times, we would not consider any offers from the White House that the president has not publicly endorsed. While we await the presidentís public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One.î†The U.S. Secret Service is among the agencies whose funding ran out at midnight Dec. 21. About a quarter of the federal government is in that category, affecting some 800,000 employees in all ó half of whom were furloughed, while the other half, deemed essential, must work anyway. Neither group will see another paycheck until Trump has signed legislation that resumes funding.Those without enough savings on hand will be forced to borrow to pay the bills in the meantime. Trumpís Office of Personnel Management, in fact, issued some pointers to employees facing trouble, such as performing maintenance chores ìin exchange for partial rent payments.îTrump promised during his campaign that he would remove himself from his family business if he was elected, but reneged on that before he took office. He continues to personally profit from the hotels and golf courses he owns, including ones he frequents in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.Mar-a-Lago, his bayfront resort in Palm Beach, doubled its initiation fee from $100,000 to $200,000 after his election. Annual dues will rise about $1,000 next year, to $16,000, according to a report in The Palm Beach Post.Tickets to his members-and-guests-only New Yearís Eve party have also gotten much pricier. In 2016 they were $525 each for members and $575 for their guests. Those prices jumped to $600 and $750 last year, and $650 and $1,000 for Monday nightís party. And those amounts do not include a mandatory 20 percent gratuity and 7 percent sales tax.The Secret Service has already spent $54,020 renting tents for use at the party, according to a report in Quartz. They are typically used as shelters where agents can screen guests before they enter the grounds.At a similar party at the resort early in Trumpís presidency, a guest photographed and posted to social media the aide who accompanies Trump and carries codes for nuclear war plans as well as a dinner table meeting of Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the time North Korea had just test-fired a missile.The White House later claimed that no classified information was discussed at the meeting.Trumpís White House had indicated he would sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8. But he changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts criticized him for caving on his campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.In reality, Trump had claimed many hundreds of times that he would force Mexico to pay for such a wall, but he abandoned that part of the promise almost immediately upon taking office. He persuaded House leaders last week to insert $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money into the short-term spending extension that the Senate had already passed unanimously. But not even a majority of the Senate voted for the revised version of that bill, let alone the 60 it would need for passage.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Before the shutdown, 75 percent of the government had already been funded until September 2019.ìUntil hell freezes over,î Gohmert continued. ìBecause we owe it to our country.îHe also suggested that a wall would somehow be beneficial to nations south of the U.S. border. ìAnd the best thing we could do compassionately for Mexico and Central America is not give them money that ends up in the hands of drug cartels,î the congressman said. ìItís to secure the border so the drugs quit coming and we donít lose 70,000 more lives a year and Mexico becomes the top 10 economy because we get out the corruption. Thatís compassion.îAs of Friday, the partial shutdown had lasted for seven days with no immediate end in sight. The government is unlikely to fully reopen before the new Democratic-controlled Congress is sworn in next month.†President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has been trying to put the blame for the shutdown on the Democrats.ìWe will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!î Trump tweeted on Friday morning.On Thursday, the president went so far as to say that the shutdown wasnít ìabout the Wallî but ìonly about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win.î††Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The closures would begin on Jan. 2 and continue until lawmakers reach a deal to fund the government.Because the museums have so far remained open, many people assumed the Smithsonian Institution was among the roughly three-quarters of government functions that Congress had already appropriated money for before the partial shutdown began on Dec. 22. But Smithsonian spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas explained that it had been running on last yearís funds to get through the week between Christmas and New Yearís <U+2015> typically one of the busiest times of the year.†The Smithsonian Institution receives its federal dollars through an appropriations bill that also funds the Interior Department, which is among the unfunded agencies.ìWe used prior-year funding, and we canít continue to do that,î St. Thomas said. ìI think it was a great service to tourists, but on Jan. 2 and beyond we will be closedî until a deal is reached.A closure of the Smithsonian would be just one way that everyday Americans will feel the effects of the shutdown, even if they donít work for the federal government. The shuttered properties would include the American History Museum, the Air and Space Museum, the African American Museum and the Portrait Gallery, as well as more than a dozen others.††President Donald Trump has said the shutdown will continue until lawmakers agree to provide $5 billion for a wall along the southern border that he originally said Mexico would pay for. House Republicans have said they have no plans to hold a vote before the new year, leaving the shutdown with no end in sight. An agreement that meets Trumpís full demands is even less likely after Jan. 3, when Democrats take over as the House majority.The shutdown has left 420,000 federal employees working without pay, and another 380,000 furloughed without a job. It will require an act of Congress to retroactively pay those workers once the government reopens. There is no guarantee that will happen, although it typically has in the past.St. Thomas said roughly two-thirds of the Smithsonianís employees are federal workers; the rest are paid through the Smithsonian trust. If the museums and zoo are forced to close, only certain workers like security and building maintenance personnel will remain on the job.Many workers would be unlucky enough to lose their wages even if Congress approves backpay after the shutdown ends. Thatís because they work for an outside contractor rather than the federal government. According to St. Thomas, the museum shops are run by the Smithsonian, but cafeteria workers are employed by an outside company called Restaurant Associates.If the 2013 government shutdown is any indication, those workers may end up having to apply for unemployment insurance if the shutdown persists, as any day not working is a day without pay. A company spokesman declined to comment when asked how many Restaurant Associates employees would be affected by a shutdown.Even though the zoo would be closed, St. Thomas said veterinarians and other workers who feed and care for the animals there would still be on duty throughout a shutdown. ìThe minute thereís funding, we open,î she said.CORRECTION:†A previous version of this story mistakenly indicated the Smithsonian is receives its funding through the Department of Interior.†"

Previously Democrats were negotiating with the administration over an offer less than the more than $5 billion Trump wants for the project.The White House brought an offer between Trumpís $5.7 billion and $1.3 billion to the Democrats over the weekend, leaving Sens.

The presidentís the leader. Heís to get everyone in a room and heís got to lead,î Trump said in the clip.Lemon aired the clip on Thursday night and deadpanned, ìStarts from the top. If anyone should get fired, the president. Hm.îìDonald Trump suggesting that President Barack Obama should have been fired for a government shutdown. Priceless,î Lemon added before the end of the segment.As we continue into Day 7 of the†governmentís partial shutdown†with no end in sight, arguments over who will fund Trumpís desired border wall between the United States and Mexico continue.The impasse comes from a spending bill with $5.7 billion tacked on for Trumpís border wall that passed in the House, but is unlikely to pass in the Senate, which is adjourned until Monday. Sixty votes are needed for the bill to pass, and there are only 51 Republicans. Trump blames the Democrats, who oppose the money for the wall, for the shutdown, claiming: ìItís really the Democrat shutdown.îWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement on Thursday that Trump and his team†ìstayed in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities, and re-open the government. The Democrats decided to go home.îAdditionally, the shutdown has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay (and many still working) during the holiday season. As if that wasnít bad enough, many of those workers, who are contractors, wonít even see retroactive pay.Lemon addressing the irony of Trump calling for Obama to be fired during a 2013 shutdown when all he can do is blame the Democrats during his own has been something of a trend for the CNN host this month.Last week, Lemon aired old footage Trump bragging about his vast knowledge of campaign finance.ìI think nobody knows more about campaign finance than I do because Iím the biggest contributor,î Trump said to then-late-night TV host Larry King in the clip from 1999.Lemon quipped that despite Trump claiming he ìknows plenty about campaign finance,î thereís ìalways a tape or a tweet for everything,î a nod to the legal issues Trumpís former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is embroiled in.Cohen has been sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to numerous criminal charges ó including violating campaign finance laws, which he says was done at Trumpís request.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The EPA did not immediately return HuffPostís request for comment.Employees who receive notification of their furlough status will need to update their voicemail and emails with out-of-office messages and will be barred from any work-related travel, according to Wheeler.EPA begins preparing for an extended shutdown. The agency initially had enough money to stay funded until tomorrow at midnight. pic.twitter.com/cb5cImkwpGWhile the government officially shut down on Dec. 21, the EPA was able to continue operating because it had saved enough federal funds to carry over†into the following week. Wheelerís latest message to employees indicates that those funds are now running out.†More than 700 EPA employees who are considered essential will be forced to work without pay during the shutdown, while the remaining ìnon-essentialî workers, who number over 13,000, will be furloughed, according to the agencyís shutdown contingency plan. According to the EPAís plan, senior officials have to determine what work must continue during the shutdown or risk an imminent threat to public health, human safety or property. The shutdown could potentially affect the EPAís efforts to clean Superfund sites, where hazardous waste is contaminating land. In the contingency plan, signed last week, the agency announced that it would evaluate 800 contaminated Superfund sites to determine which ones pose the worst public health threats should a shutdown halt cleanup efforts.Also affected are inspections for drinking water systems, hazardous waste management sites and chemical facilities, along with pesticide reviews. In total, about 400,000 federal employees are expected to be affected by the partial government shutdown.On Thursday, the House and Senate reconvened briefly and adjourned with few lawmakers in attendance. With no vote on the spending bill scheduled, the government shutdown is likely to extend into January, when Democrats take control of the House. "

But another group of workers has also been hit hard and, unlike federal workers, may never see retroactive pay: government contractors. †Many government contractors <U+2015> from food workers and janitors to security services and computer software developers <U+2015> depend on federal funds for their wages. Since the shutdown, some have seen their jobs furloughed or have received ìstop work orders,î meaning theyíre out of work until the government is up and running again. And while federal employees, who may or may not have to work during the shutdown, will likely later get back pay for this period, government contractors in all likelihood will not. ìStarting yesterday, I was expected to go back to work, but, of course, I couldnít,î said 47-year-old Misty Carrothers, a paralegal on a government contract with the Department of Justice. Her last day of work was Friday, due to the shutdown, which started that midnight. ìMy last paycheck covers the first-of-the-month bills, which are the big ones: rent and car insurance. But then you have credit cards that come in the middle of the month, and my health insurance may or may not be fully covered on my next paycheck,î she said, noting that her husband is a student who works only part time. ìItís just like,†when is this going to end?î Other contractors took to Twitter to share their struggles under the hashtag #ShutdownStories, recounting their concerns about being out of work over the holidays and how theyíll get by.Yes, please!

Federal employees considered ìnon-essentialî at affected departments have been furloughed, while ìessentialî ones <U+2015> including thousands of workers at the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and members of the Coast Guard <U+2015> are required to work without pay until the shutdown ends. †In previous government shutdowns, federal employee salaries were suspended, but lawmakers later proposed that they get†paid retroactively, even if they werenít working. But that hasnít applied to government contractors in the past, according to Susan Moser, a partner at the Cherry Bekaert accounting firm, which has clients who work under government contracts.ìYou hear a lot in the paper about the government employees, and Iím sympathetic to their uncertainty, but if history is any indicator, they do get paid, even if they didnít work <U+2015> but thatís usually not the case with government contractors,î Moser said. ìThey are disproportionately affected. You donít hear a lot about these professionals who help make the government run.îNo one knows when the government will be up and running again. As of Thursday, President Donald Trump did not appear to be budging on his demands for funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and House members were reportedly told not to expect further votes this week, meaning the shutdown will likely stretch into next week and possibly the new year.ìFear is probably the common denominator,î said Luke Chung, president of software company FMS†Inc., which had a government contract with Amtrak. He said his employeesí wages will not be disrupted because the contract is small and didnít require a dedicated staff team. ìBusiness owners who have staff are making the decision: Do we pay people or not, even though we wonít get paid by the government?î Chung said. ìEither you force people to take vacation, or you pay them, to be a good company <U+2015> but depending how long it drags on, one may not have a choice.î Carrothers said she plans to apply for unemployment in the interim, but that will provide only 55 percent of her paycheck.

The New Horizons mission team said the nickname refers to ìa place beyond the known world.î Ultima Thule is roughly the size of New York City and orbits the sun†once every 297 years,†according to National Geographic.But itís Ultima Thuleís location that makes it interesting to scientists. The object resides 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, in the Kuiper Belt. This region stretches around the sun and is home to millions of icy bodies. Scientists believe these bodies are leftovers from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago and have remained largely unchanged since then.†ìItís the oldest relic of the solar system weíve ever studied,î New Horizons team member Marc Buie told National Geographic.Alan Stern, the NASA missionís principal investigator, said in a Facebook Live video that scientists arenít sure what to expect from Ultima Thule.†ìWhen we fly past Ultima, weíre going to have a chance to see the way things were back at the beginning,î he said. ìItís completely unknown and unexplored.î†New Horizons launched into space in January 2006. Four years ago, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint Kuiper Belt objects within the spacecraftís reach and settled on Ultima Thule.New Horizons is hurtling through space at†31,500 miles per hour†(more than eight miles a second) to reach the object. As it passes Ultima Thule, it will take hundreds of photographs and other measurements to collect more information about the celestial body. The†team hopes to map the objectís surface, figure out its temperature and determine if it has an atmosphere, moons or rings.According to a schedule released by the New Horizons team, the spacecraft will fly by Ultima Thule at 12:33 a.m. Eastern time on Jan. 1. It will travel within 2,200 miles of the body, less than one-third the distance of its closest approach to Pluto.Thereís still some uncertainty, though; New Horizonsí images could come back blurred if Ultima Thule is rotating rapidly, National Geographic reports. And thereís also a chance that the spacecraftís camera could miss it completely.ìWe might get it, and we might not,î Stern said on†Facebook Live. ìAnd if we get it, itís going to be spectacular.î†The New Horizons team will be counting down to the spacecraftís closest approach to Ultima Thule early on New Yearís Day. Some results from the encounter will be shared in the following days, but it will take the spacecraft until 2020 to send all the data from the encounter back to Earth.†Michael Buckley, the New Horizons teamís media spokesperson, told HuffPost that the partial government shutdown that started Saturday will have no effect on the projectís mission or science operations.†In case the shutdown remains in effect on Jan. 1, the team has partnered with the†Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory†to provide live coverage of the flyby.Coverage will be streamed on the laboratoryís YouTube channel and the New Horizons mission website.†"

It was the first day that would have been a normal workday for most affected employees.ìDemocratís say they donít want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they donít want ICE,î he wrote later. ìThey donít have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!îTrump has not spoken to the Democratic leader in either chamber of Congress in recent days. Discussions have continued at the staff level, but Democrats said the problem remains that Trump himself does not seem to know what exactly he wants.ìHe does not appear to have a clear endgame in sight,î one senior Democratic aide said on condition of anonymity.Trumpís White House had indicated he would sign a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8, but then Trump changed his mind after TV and radio hosts criticized him for caving on his campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border.Actually, Trump had claimed he would force Mexico to pay for such a wall, but he abandoned that part of the promise almost immediately upon taking office. He persuaded House leaders to insert $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money into the short-term spending extension that the Senate had already passed unanimously. But not even a majority of the Senate voted for the revised version of that bill last week, let alone the 60 votes it would need for passage.Both the House and Senate held brief procedural sessions Thursday, but almost no lawmakers were in town. Similar procedural sessions were set for Monday, New Yearís Eve, but the most likely scenario seemed to be that the whole issue would be put off until Jan. 3, when the new Congress is seated with Democrats taking control of the House.Nine Cabinet agencies, including the departments of homeland security, justice, state and interior, ran out of funding at midnight Dec. 21, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees uncertain if they would get scheduled paychecks in mid-January.In a Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump said he would be ìproud to shut down the government for border securityî if Democrats refused to agree to billions of additional dollars for his wall. Ever since that point, though, Trump has reversed tactics and is blaming Democrats <U+2015> even taking that message to U.S. troops in Iraq.ìYouíre fighting for borders in other countries, and they donít want to fight <U+2015> the Democrats <U+2015> for the border of our country. It doesnít make a lot of sense,î Trump told service members Wednesday at Al-Asad Air Base on his first visit to a combat zone since taking office.ìThe president turned his first visit to our troops into another cringe-worthy Donald Trump reality show special,î said Drew Hammill, a Pelosi aide. ìWith the House majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump shutdown and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our service members and veterans.îWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump has already sacrificed to reach a deal to end the shutdown but that Democrats are uninterested. ìThe president and his team stayed in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities and reopen the government,î Sanders said. ìThe president does not want the government to remain shut down, but he will not sign a proposal that does not first prioritize our countyís safety and security.îTrump had originally planned to fly down to his resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Dec. 21 after signing the short-term extension. The ongoing shutdown, though, could make it politically difficult for Trump to salvage even a portion of his planned 16-day golfing vacation.Among the agencies whose employees are either working as ìessentialî or have been furloughed is the Secret Service. If Trump chooses to go to Mar-a-Lago and his nearby golf course in West Palm Beach, he will create the public relations disaster the White House had hoped to avoid: Trump playing golf while the Secret Service protecting him donít know if theyíll get their next paycheck.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

He has been provoking federal workers since pretty much the day he assumed office <U+2015> whether itís threatening a pay freeze, trying to strip away job protections or equating civil servants with a bloated and corrupt ìswamp.îTo those who advocate for federal employees, the shutdown is part of a larger pattern with the White House. ìItís almost as if we have an administration that is at war with its own workforce,î said Jacque Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 government workers. ìItís been an ongoing assault on the economic interests of federal employees.îTrump has warned that the government may be shut down ìfor a very long timeî if Democrats donít sign off on $5 billion for a wall the president used to say Mexico would pay for. Trump hasnít found enough votes in Congress to break the stalemate, even though Republicans still control both the House and Senate. Democratsí hand will be stronger on Jan. 3, when they take over as the House majority.Roughly three quarters of the governmentís funding has already been appropriated by Congress, leaving only certain agencies closed for the shutdown. An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and another 380,000 have been furloughed, meaning they are out of work for the duration. It would require an act of Congress to retroactively pay both groups of workers once the government reopens, as lawmakers have typically done in the past.But backpay is no guarantee with a divided Congress. Meanwhile, depending on how long the shutdown lasts, workers without sufficient savings may be forced to take out short-term loans, search for part-time jobs or apply for unemployment insurance to tide them over until work resumes. (Many federal contractors, who are not direct employees of the government, will never recoup the wages they missed due to agencies shuttering temporarily.)Simon said some of the unionís members who were slated to be furloughed were called into work the day after Christmas in order to help wind down agency functions for the shutdown. ìWith this administration, nothing is orderly. They certainly are making it up as they go,î she said.If Trump seems cavalier about the disruption, perhaps itís because sticking it to federal workers has been central to his politics.In his State of the Union address this year, Trump said he wanted to try to make it easier for federal agencies to fire employees, a move some ethics watchdogs said would politicize agency work. His administration later made good on the threat, issuing a batch of executive orders aimed at peeling back job protections for civil servants and weakening federal employee unions. In a major setback for Trump, a judge blocked those orders in August, ruling that the president cannot ìeviscerate the right to bargain collectivelyî by federal workers.Days after that ruling, Trump announced in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) that he wanted to cancel a scheduled 2.1 percent pay raise for the federal workforce in fiscal year 2019. The president said he wanted to implement an ìalternativeî pay plan <U+2015> zero percent <U+2015> to keep the country on a ìfiscally sustainable course.îTrump cannot unilaterally block the raise without cooperation from Congress, and he later suggested he was reconsidering his position. But so far, lawmakers have not approved a pay hike for 2019. The administration has also floated the idea of paring back federal workersí retirement benefits. The White Houseís budget blueprint for 2018 proposed increasing employeesí pension contributions and changing the formula to reduce retireesí annuity payments, among other cost-cutting measures. Those plans appear to be on hold for the time being. For all the proposed cuts to raises and benefits, Tony Reardon, the president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said heís bothered just as much by the ìdismissive and disrespectfulî stance he believes the White House holds toward federal workers. Even on the campaign trail, Trump called for abolishing entire federal agencies, declaring there was îtremendous waste, fraud, and abuse<U+2033> in the ranks of the federal government.ìEven coming into power this administration talked about emptying the ëswamp,í as though frontline federal employees are somehow representative [of that],î said Reardon, whose union represents 150,000 workers in different agencies.He noted that federal employees tend to earn middle-class wages and are scattered all over the country, with the overwhelming majority living outside the Washington area.ìWhy are these people consistently under attack,î Reardon asked, ìwhen all theyíve really done is take a job to do the hard work of the United States government?îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tweeted on Sunday, adding, ìItís deeply concerning.î†Actor and Me Too activist Alyssa Milano added her disappointment, tweeting: ìWhat kind of country allows its Violence Against Women Act to expire?îThe landmark legislation, which protects domestic violence and sexual assault survivors, was set to expire on Sept. 30 and later on Dec. 7, but was given short-term extensions each time. Prior to the shutdown, both the House and Senate passed budget agreements that would cover the costs of VAWA programs through Feb. 8, 2019.The shutdown, however, which is affecting over 800,000 federal workers, forced VAWA to expire because the lawís programs are funded under the Justice Department. The legislationís expiration does not affect all of its programsí operations, according to The Washington Post.†Grants already awarded before the shutdown will not be affected, but future payments for anti-domestic and anti-sexual violence programs funded by VAWA will be cut off until the legislation is reauthorized.†ìThe Violence Against Women Act <U+2015> which supports critical programs to help victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and stalking <U+2015> expired at midnight. We could have funded it, but @realDonaldTrump would rather shut down the government for a wall that doesnít make us any safer,î Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted on Saturday.†The government shutdown has continued due to a larger budget debate about President Donald Trumpís desired U.S.-Mexico border wall, which he campaigned on. Trump has recently†asked for a $5 billion budget to build a concrete wall running along the southern border, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) continue to balk at a number that high.VAWA, the first federal legislation to recognize and address domestic violence as a serious crime, was created with the help of then-Sen. Joe Biden (D) and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994. The legislation was reauthorized in 2000, 2005 and 2013 with bipartisan support.†ìVAWA has always been, and must always be, a bipartisan commitment to improve access to safety and justice, to prevent future violence, and to uphold the dignity and autonomy of all victims and survivors,î the National Task Force To End Sexual And Domestic Violence said in a statement published at the beginning of October, after the first short-term budget extension was awarded.†According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCDAV), 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will experience intimate partner violence within their lifetime. One in 3 women and 1 in 6 men will be victims of sexual violence in their lifetime in the United States, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC).†In September, 46 House Republicans sent a letter to House Speaker†Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), urging leadership to reauthorize VAWA before it was set to expire on Sept. 30.†Pelosi also wrote a letter to Ryan criticizing his and other House Republicansí inaction on the legislation.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Senior administration officials told The Washington Post that ìdozensî of immigrants have been taken to hospitals near the border with flu-like symptoms.ìThis crisis is exacerbated by the increase in persons who are entering our custody suffering from severe respiratory illnesses or exhibit some other illness upon apprehension,î Nielsen said Wednesday. ìGiven the remote locations of their illegal crossing and the lack of resources, it is even more difficult for our personnel to be first responders.îNielsenís announcement was issued more than a day after Alonzo, who had been detained with his father since Dec. 18, died while in CBP custody.†Alonzo is the second immigrant child to die while in detention this month. Two weeks earlier, Jakelin Caal, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who survived a 2,000-mile journey to the U.S., died less than 48 hours after being detained by CBP at the border, along with 163 others. Caal died of shock and dehydration, according to The Washington Post.At the time, Nielsen blamed Caalís family for the 7-year-oldís death, insisting that the migrant group shouldnít have tried to enter the U.S.ìYou know, this is just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey,î Nielsen said on ìFox & Friendsî on Dec. 14. ìThis family chose to cross illegally.îWhile Nielsen prepares for her border trip, House Democrats are vowing to investigate Caalís and Alonzoís deaths. In a statement Wednesday,†House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) urged the Department of Homeland Security to provide Congress with ìinformation the public deserves to know and to take action to prevent such tragedies from recurring.îNielsen suggested Wednesday that the recent deaths of the two detained immigrant children were rare, pointing out that the last child to die while in custody occurred ìmore than a decadeî ago.†ìTo put this in perspective, there were six migrant deaths in CBP custody during FY 2018 <U+2015> none whom were children,î Nielsen said.†ìIt is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,î she added.But Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) challenged Nielsenís claim that no other migrant children have died in custody in the last decade. In a tweet, Castro called on Nielsen to appear in front of Congress and say under oath that none of the six migrants who died this year under CBP custody were children.Calling on @SecNielsen to tell Congress, under oath, that six migrant deaths occurred this fiscal year in @CBP custody, and that none were children.

Democrats in Congress, however, fare substantially less badly than their GOP equivalents <U+2015> a shift from the shutdown this January, after which the ratings were more evenly distributed.Americans disapprove of the handling of the shutdown by Congress as a whole (by a 33-point margin), congressional Republicans (29 points), President Trump (14 points) and congressional Democrats (9 points). Members of Congress fare better with their constituents: Americans are split 35/37 in approving or disapproving of their own representativesí performance.Pundits often seem to envision public opinions in the wake of shutdowns as a zero-sum game, in which the public assigns blame to one side and absolves the other. Survey questions asked about such battles often lend themselves to such frames as well.But the reality of how Americans think about the shutdowns isnít necessarily so clear-cut. Partisans tend to heap condemnation on their opponents, but arenít necessarily ecstatic about their own sideís decisions. Other people, especially if they follow politics only casually, may be more likely to write the whole thing off as Washington dysfunction. (To get a better sense of how people view the shutdown, we also asked survey respondents to explain in their own words what was happening. You can see some of their responses at the end of the article.)Even when shutdowns appear politically damaging, the effects can be short-lived. In 2013, Republicans saw their numbers plunge historically following a shutdown. But within months, the opprobrium wore off, leaving the GOP to go on to a sweeping victory in the following yearís midterms.In the newest survey, just under half of Americans say Trump is at least somewhat responsible for the shutdown, with about 39 percent saying congressional Democrats bear at least partial responsibility, and about 30 percent that Republicans in Congress do. (Some of the people polled, before being asked the question, were informed that President Trump had both pronounced himself ìproud to shut down the governmentî and later blamed the impending closure on the Democrats. It didnít appear to have a dramatic effect on the overall results.)Forty-five percent of Americans say Trump should have compromised on the border wall to prevent gridlock, while 35 percent say he was right not to compromise even though it led to a partial shutdown. The other 20 percent arenít sure.A tenth of Americans say theyíve been personally affected by the partial shutdown, or that they expect they will be. In many cases, theyíre taking the definition of ìaffectedî rather lightly (ìI have to hear it incessantly on the newsî), broadly (ìEverything government does will always affect the peopleî), or hypothetically (ìWhat if I want to go to a [national] park?î).Hundreds of thousands of government workers, however, are furloughed or working without pay, with effects that often ripple beyond their immediate families. ìMy brother works for the Federal Government and his family and he will be directly affected,î wrote one man who was polled. ìWe will send them money to help out.î A Democrat, he held Trump and the Republicans responsible for the shutdown, but approved of his own partyís response. Several other furloughed workers also described themselves as unhappy with Trumpís actions, though†not all felt that way.ìMy husband is one of those non-essential employees that eventually gets paid for sitting home,î wrote one Republican woman. ìWe are punished with the stress of waiting for a paycheck and living out of our savings because they want to play politics with peopleís livelihoods to work out details of how we spend our tax payer money.î She said the president and both parties in Congress were all at least partially responsible for the shutdown, but believed Trump was right not to compromise. The partial shutdown hasnít gone unnoticed by the broader public either, despite the holiday weekend. Most Americans say theyíre following the news at least as closely as usual, and nearly 60 percent say theyíve been paying at least some attention to the shutdown.Sixty-one percent consider the partial shutdown to be at least a serious problem, similar to the share who said the same of the shutdown this January. Just 29 percent, however, consider it very serious.In order to get a better sense of how different Americans across the country are following and reacting to the news, we also asked survey respondents to briefly describe what was happening with the partial shutdown. A small sampling of the responses are below, sorted by 2016 presidential vote.†Some answers have been edited lightly for length or clarity,†- ìBoth parties of our government can not come to an agreement on the proposed wall that President Trump wants to build, or should I say where that funding should come from.î- ìColonel Bonespurs, the bloated orange pimple in our White House, wants to waste billions of our tax money and the Republicans wonít oppose his stupidity but the Democrats will. So he wonít sign whatís necessary to keep the government operating until he gets the wall-money to flush down the toilet.î- ìSome departments of the government will be sending people home or people will be working for free <U+2015> this money will hopefully be restored to them at a later time.î†- ìAccording to the meeting between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said that he would shut down the government and it would be on him but today heís blaming the Democrats. He knows heís not going to get a wall built on the southern border, and now he says itís a ëbeautiful fenceí instead of a wall. What we need is border protection which doesnít necessarily mean a wall....If I had my way both the House, Senate and the President should be locked in a room and nobody gets to go home until SOMETHING is passed!î- ìAfter Trump decided to sign a CR approved by the Senate, talking right wing heads convinced him to not sign the CR.î- ìDemocrats and Republicans are not agreeing on stuff.î- ìI havenít been following the event. I wasnít even aware it is happening.î- îBiggest issue: border security. Democrats want no wall, and are stalling until they control the House in January. Republicans want to get a budget with a wall passed now, for the same reason.î- îA bunch of unnecessary government workers got sent home because the Democrats donít care about our security and want to flood the country with illegals that they want to turn into Democrat voters.î- ìIt was triggered by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter broadcasting their comments saying Trump was weak, and Trump had to prove otherwise.î- ìSenate Republicans do not have the 60 votes necessary to pass the spending bill passed in the House of Representatives that aligns with Trumpís vision for border security by constructing a wall or barrier. Democrats refuse to compromise to secure our southern border and Trump refuses to cave in to Democratic demands. Typical Washington gridlock!î- ìI really donít know. I donít care right now. It is Christmas time and Im not going to let liberals and Democrats bring it down for me so I tend to ignore it lately.î- ìPolitics as usual. The Dems and GOP canít agree that the sky is blue.î- ìDue to the inability for both parties in Congress to reach an agreement on the budget for the following months (due to the budget for the border wall being attached to said bill), Congress adjourned with no budget for the country approved.î- îI think that itís very unnecessary to shut the government down because of a wall.î†- îDemocrats are playing politics for a measly (relative to our budget) $5 billion. They donít want any type of wall because Trump will get re-elected. The government shutdown is solely on them. And who cares if the government shuts down?? It should STAY shut down.î- ìPresident Trump has shut down the government because he canít get funding for a pet project.î- îFrom what I know, they canít agree on something and if they donít make a decision soon, the government will shut down until they can. I might have my facts wrong, too. I donít remember what it was they couldnít agree on.î'- ìGirl, I donít know.

The other branches receive their money through Department of Defense appropriations, which were signed into law in September.With the DHS funding lapsed, roughly 44,000 active-duty Coast Guard members will be working without paychecks until Congress and the White House reach a deal to reopen the government and provide back pay. Another 6,000 Coast Guard employees are being furloughed, according to DHS guidance. That means they wonít be working and any pay for the shutdown period would have to come retroactively, through an act of Congress.A Coast Guard spokesman said active-duty members are usually paid on the first and 15th of each month. If the shutdown persists through Friday, they would not receive their scheduled Jan. 1 paychecks.As HuffPost reported last week, members of President Donald Trumpís Secret Service contingent are also DHS employees and will be working without pay during the shutdown.Trump said he is prepared to carry out a ìvery longî shutdown to secure $5 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S. southern border that he had insisted Mexico was supposed to pay for. Although Republicans still control both the House and Senate, they donít have enough votes for a deal on wall funding without Democrats. Trump will have an even harder time rounding up votes for his wall when the new Congress takes office next week, with Democrats taking over as the House majority on Jan. 3.An estimated 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, and roughly 380,000 have been furloughed†as a quarter of the government remains closed. After previous shutdowns, Congress has passed laws to pay furloughed workers for the time they missed, and itís likely lawmakers would do the same after this one. †As HuffPost previously detailed, government shutdowns are quite expensive, forcing agencies to develop contingency plans and throwing hundreds of thousands of government employees off their normal work. The work stoppages also can damage consumer confidence in the overall economy and take a bite out of the nationís gross domestic product.Many workers who are guaranteed backpay when the government reopens still must worry about how theyíll cover their bills in the meantime. A woman describing herself as the wife of an active-duty Coast Guard member said on Twitter that she fears not being able to cover the familyís rent. She was one of many using the #ShutdownStories hashtag:My husband is active duty Coast Guard. Everyone thinks the military is getting paid during the shutdown, but the Coast Guard is facing no pay on the 1st due to being DHS and not DoD. We live in NYC, pay over $2K/month in rent, have a toddler and one on the way.#ShutdownStoriesTrump wished Coast Guard members and others in the military a happy holiday during a call in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. ìItís a disgrace whatís happening in our country, but other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas,î the president said.†The Navy Federal Credit Union said it would be offering interest-free loans to eligible members who donít receive their paychecks on the first of the month. A Navy Federal spokesman said Coast Guard members who have direct deposit through the credit union can register for the loans up to three days after their normal payday.Workers who pay the biggest price in a shutdown tend to be those who are not federal employees but work under federal contracts, such as janitors and those employed by concessions that operate at federal buildings. These workers generally have no way of recouping back pay for time they missed while the government was closed.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

CBP said in a statement late Tuesday that an agent first noticed the boy had a cough and ìglossy eyesî at about 9 a.m. Monday. He was eventually hospitalized twice and died just before midnight, the agency said. CBP earlier said that the boy died just after midnight.CBP said in the statement it needs the help of other government agencies to provide health care. The agency ìis considering options for surge medical assistanceî from the Coast Guard and may request help from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.A CBP spokesman could not immediately answer how many children are currently in the agencyís custody. But with border crossings surging, CBP processes thousands of children ó both alone and with their parents ó every month.Immigration advocates and human rights groups sharply criticized CBP in the wake of Felipeís death. The body of†7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died earlier this month, was returned this week to her village in Guatemala for burial.Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said the Trump administrationís ìpolicies of cruelty toward migrants and asylum-seekers at the border must cease immediately before any more children are harmed.îThe White House referred questions about the latest case to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, CBPís parent agency. CBP officers and the Border Patrol remain on the job despite the shutdown.CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement that the childís death was a ìtragic loss.î The agency said it has notified the DHS inspector general.CBP issued a timeline of what it said happened before Felipeís death.Felipe was taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he was diagnosed with a common cold, according to the timeline.The boy was released just before 3 p.m., about 90 minutes after he had been found to have a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 Celsius), CBP said. He was prescribed amoxicillin and ibuprofen, and taken with his father to a holding facility at a highway checkpoint.At about 7 p.m., agents helped clean up the boyís vomit. CBP said the father ìdeclined further medical assistanceî then.But at about 10 p.m., the boy ìappeared lethargic and nauseous again,î the agency said, and agents decided to have taken to the hospital. The boy died at 11:48 p.m. Monday, the agency said.The hospital, the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, declined to comment, citing privacy regulations.Felipe and his father were detained by CBP for about a week, an unusually long time that the agency did not fully explain Tuesday.CBP typically detains immigrants for no more than a few days when they cross the border before either releasing them or turning them over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for longer-term detention.Agency guidelines say immigrants generally shouldnít be detained for more than 72 hours in CBP holding facilities, which are usually smaller and have fewer services than ICE detention centers.CBP said it apprehended Felipe and his father on Dec. 18 about 3 miles away from an official port of entry, the Paso del Norte bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, Mexico. They were held at a processing center for almost two days, then taken to the El Paso Border Patrol station on Thursday.CBP said it moved them to Alamogordo, New Mexico, at about 1 a.m. Sunday ìbecause of capacity levels at the El Paso station.î Alamogordo is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) from El Paso.The agency didnít say why it held Felipe and his father for so long, but said its officers repeatedly conducted welfare checks on them.Oscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said he was told by the boyís father in a telephone interview that the two had been traveling from their home in NentÛn, a village about 280 miles (450 kilometers) from Guatemala City. They were planning to go to Johnson City, Tennessee.CBP promised ìan independent and thorough review of the circumstances,î and the Guatemalan foreign ministry called for an investigation ìin accordance with due process.îDemocratic members of Congress and immigration advocates†sharply criticized†CBPís handling of Jakelin Caalís death and questioned whether border agents could have prevented it by spotting symptoms of distress or calling for an evacuation by air ambulance sooner.CBP has said that it took several hours to transport Jakelin and her father from a remote Border Patrol facility to a larger station, where her temperature was measured at 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit (40.9 degrees Celsius). Emergency medical technicians had to revive her twice. She was ultimately flown to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next day.Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the childrenís deaths and more medical resources along the border.ìThis is inexcusable,î Torres Small said in a statement Tuesday. ìInstead of immediately acting to keep children and all of us safe along our border, this administration forced a government shutdown over a wall.î"

The Food Nutrition and Consumer Services office deals not only with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but also the Child Nutrition Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).While SNAP benefits will remain available in January and Child Nutrition programs will continue into February, the future of WIC is uncertain as the shutdown lingers on. The USDA suggested that states turn to local resources if needed.In a statement Friday just before the governmentís partial closure, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue attempted to ease concerns, noting the agency would try its best to keep to business as usual.ìThere may be a lapse in funding for the federal government, but that will not relieve USDA of its responsibilities for safeguarding life and property through the critical services we provide,î Perdue said. ìOur employees work hard every day to benefit our customers and the farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers who depend on our programs. During a shutdown, we will leverage our existing resources as best we can to continue to provide the top-notch service people expect.îThe agency echoed Perdueís message on Twitter hours after the shutdown kicked in.During a lapse in government funding, we will be providing as many of our core services as we can using existing resources. We're keeping up our duty to ""Do Right and Feed Everyone,"" as @SecretarySonny says. More info here: https://t.co/jAI9UJDhlgKey USDA services that wonít be cut include its inspections of poultry, meat and eggs and its monitoring of imports and exports for pests.So far, thereís no end to the shutdown in sight as President Donald Trump continues battling for a spending bill with border wall funding, which has been stymied by the House despite passing the Senate. It is becoming increasingly possible the government might not reopen until January when Democrats gain control of the House.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

The toy trains were not whirring. Even the nearby bathrooms were locked.The national Christmas tree, symbol of a countryís seasonal cheer, instead stood as an icon of a government in paralysis, as the partial shutdown stretched into the holiday with an array of federal services frozen, some 800,000 public servants either idled or about to be and the disruption to the broader public bound to grow when the quiet spell ends later this week.Already facilities at many national parks were shuttered, if the parks were accessible at all, and thousands of federal buildings were to remain closed when the work week resumed unless President Donald Trump and members of Congress quickly break through a budget impasse that the White House said could drag on into 2019.Under cloudy skies in a brisk wind on the third day of the shutdown, the capital put on little holiday wonder for visitors like Greg Forcherio of Columbia, Maryland, a government contractor with no office to work in after the holidays as long as federal buildings stayed closed. He, his wife and their toddler on Monday came to see the giant, glittering spruce tree brought from Colorado to serve as the national Christmas tree, normally a focal point for Washington holiday visitors.But a locked chain-link fence blocked access to the site and the nearby White House visitorís center and its bathrooms were closed, with a hand-scrawled sign directing visitors to portable toilets, which also were chained shut. ìKind of annoying when youíve got young children,î Forcherio said.Access to the site was restored later Monday and finally, as night fell on Christmas Eve, the lights returned. The government had announced a day earlier that it would be sealed off because of the shutdown and because repairs had slowed after an episode of vandalism on the tree before the weekend. It reopened with money from the National Park Foundation, a charity.†A labor organization representing U.S. Treasury employees said Monday that federal workers around the country were cutting back on spending and changing holiday plans with family because of the shutdown.ìJust in case anyone still thinks a partial shutdown over a holiday weekend is harmless, think again,î Tony Reardon of the National Treasury Employees Union said in a statement. ìYour friends and neighbors around the country who work for the federal government are already showing signs of financial stress.ìIn the mountain town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Taylor Futch said the shutdown has already put extra stress on her family, whose sole income comes from her husband, a wildlife biologist who works with black bears for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. With two young daughters, the couple is facing an $800 land payment due at the beginning of January as well as a mortgage, car payment and the usual bills.ìWeíre trying to gather up a couple things just in case I need to start selling stuff on Facebook or eBay,î she said. ìIf his paycheck doesnít get here on Friday, we may not have enough for the mortgage.ìFederal workers at the agencies affected by the gap in appropriations go unpaid as long as the shutdown lasts. They were expected to get retroactive pay once the impasse was broken.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some still accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operating with money from states or charitable groups and others locked off. Arizona and Utah officials implemented plans to keep open Grand Canyon, Zion, Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks and provide services such as public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Concession operations such as lodges remained open, and Utahís money for parks in that state included visitor centers.Among sites closed outright: in the southwest alone, Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified National Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Of the roughly 800,000 federal employees facing deferred pay, more than half were deemed essential, such as U.S. Secret Service agents and Transportation Security Administration airport agent. About 380,000 were to be furloughed.Legislation ensuring that workers receive back pay was expected to clear Congress.The immediate impact was blunted by the timing of the shutdown ó spanning a weekend and now Christmas Eve and Christmas, both federal holiday days. But there was little chance to solve anything before Thursday at the earliest, when the House and Senate return to work.Trump stayed at the White House, canceling plans to spend the holidays in Florida, and kept up a torrent of tweets on Monday about his critics and his insistence on money for a border wall, the issue at the heart of the budget dispute.Not far from those quarters, Terri Lyons, visiting from Rockville, Maryland, with her 27-year-old daughter as they do every Christmas, found the lights off at one of her favorite monuments, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, when she visited Sunday night. A single guide tried to show tourists around in the darkness.But people were drawn to the illuminated Lincoln Memorial, she said. ìIt was the only one with lights.ìOn Monday morning, standing at the fence surrounding the tree, Lyons listened to the foreign tourists around her and said she felt embarrassed. ìI feel for the people trying to visit from outside of the country, what they think of us,î she said.___Associated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, and Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Actually, the wall is not a wall at all, but instead ìartistically designed steel slatsî that may or may not look like a drawing of a spiky-topped fence that he sent out Friday.All these interpretations of his progress on his signature campaign promise, of course, have come from Trump himself, and all in the span of a few months ó laying the groundwork for his Christmas government shutdown that on Monday saw Trump fold in even more chaos in a series of confusing tweets.ìThe Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!î he wrote at 12:10 p.m.It was unclear from the context what Trump meant by ìShutdown moneyî ó shutdowns cost the federal government money, not save it ó and White House officials did not respond to HuffPost queries on the matter.Within minutes, though, he wrote, ìI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!îHis other tweets Monday roiled stock markets and perhaps the nationís allies, but on the issue of the border wall, he seemed to be tweeting primarily to soothe himself. House members were not present at all, and the Senate held a brief procedural floor session that did not include any business.ìItís Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,î Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and expected next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wrote in a joint statement. ìThe stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve ó after he just fired the secretary of Defense.îThis month, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders alike were given assurances that Trumpís demands for American taxpayer money to build his wall would be postponed until after Pelosi takes control of the House in January. The Senate on Dec. 19 passed a short-term spending plan to fund the quarter of the government not already taken care of by earlier spending bills. The Senate proposal was so uncontroversial that it passed unanimously on a voice vote, with the House set to pass it on the floor the next day, Dec. 20, and Trump planning to fly down to Florida to start a 16-day golfing vacation on Dec. 21.That plan, though, was torn up after his favorite Fox News hosts starting attacking him on the evening of Dec. 19 for abandoning his promise to build a border wall ó a critique that was joined by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh the following afternoon.Trump dragged lame-duck House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to the White House to explain that he would not sign the Senate-passed spending plan, which allocated $1.6 billion for border security, including $1.3 billion to build and refurbish barriers, and instead was demanding billions of dollars more.Where that leaves the shutdown remains unclear. The House added $5.7 billion for border security but with no guidance as to how it would be spent. A 2018 spending bill ó which the Senate-passed extension would continue ó includes language prohibiting Trump from building any sort of structure not already in use by 2017. That would preclude the new designs that Trump toured prototypes of last year.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent his members home on Saturday and said they need not return before Thursday afternoon at the earliest. White House officials and their congressional allies by Sunday settled on the message that no resolution was possible until after Pelosi becomes speaker because liberal Democrats would not support her in the Jan. 3 House leadership election if she compromised with Trump before then.Trump, meanwhile, has gone from insisting that a wall had to be made of concrete and 30 feet tall and could not be a fence ó ìItís not a fence, Jeb, itís a WALL, and thereís a BIG difference!î he chided GOP rival Jeb Bush in 2015 ó to taking credit for the ìbollard fenceî designed and first implemented under President Barack Obama and just calling that a wall. In fact, Trumpís†newfound praise for ìsteel slatsî appears to be endorsing the exact fence design that he previously ridiculed.In their statement Monday, Schumer and Pelosi teed off on Trump for reversing course without offering any clarity on what he wanted. ìInstead of bringing certainty into peopleís lives, heís continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,î they wrote. ìMeanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment.îOne GOP consultant close to Trump said his response to the Fox and Limbaugh criticism was smart, given their influence among his hard-core supporters. Polling and focus groups conducted by a pro-Trump group, in fact, indicated that the wall remains a core issue for them, the consultant said on condition of anonymity.ìTrump voters identify all his accomplishments with the wall,î the consultant said, adding that caving without a fight would have been a disaster. Trumpís shutdown over the issue is supported by his most loyal backers, the consultant said. ìI think itís going to help him.îA former top White House official, though, said the time for Trump to move forward with his wall was a year ago, and that believing a wall would be supported by a Democratic House without giving up major concessions on immigration that his base would hate is a fantasy.ìThe shutdown ends with no wall,î the former official predicted, also on condition of anonymity. ìThat ship sailed.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!Most lawmakers have left town amid a stalemate on legislation to reopen the government, which partially shut down Saturday and forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers off the job. Democrats have ardently rejected Trumpís demands for $5 billion to build the wall, and anticipate more leverage once they take the House majority in January.Even some top Republicans have become exasperated at Trumpís behavior. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the retiring Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, accused the president over the weekend of manufacturing the ìjuvenileî showdown so he ìcan look like heís fightingî to please his core supporters.Trump shot back at ìLittle Bob Corker,î his derisive nickname for the senator,† on Monday, as well as Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy in charge of defeating the Islamic State in the Middle East who announced heís quitting over Trumpís abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. Both men, Trump tweeted, were responsible for President Barack Obamaís ìhorrificî Iran nuclear deal that he terminated earlier this year.And, as television news continued to focus on the extraordinary resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who also quit in protest of Trumpís Syria pullout, Trump sought to reassert his worldview that allies are taking unfair advantage of the U.S. and its taxpayers.ìGeneral Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!î Trump tweeted on Monday, repeating his claim that the U.S. is ìsubsidizingî the militaries of other nations by remaining in Syria.But what appeared to spook Wall Street most was Trumpís continuing tirade against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom the president reportedly considered ousting over fed policy raising interest rates. After Trump bizarrely complained the Federal Reserve doesnít ìhave a feelî for the markets and ìis like a powerful golfer who canít score because he has no touchî <U+2015> major indexes dove more than 2 percent in the worst Christmas Eve trading day ever, extending the worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis.The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost more than 5 percent, continuing a nosedive of more than 20 percent since its Aug. 29 peak.†The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They donít have a feel for the Market, they donít understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who canít score because he has no touch - he canít putt!Trumpís Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, may have actually contributed to the mayhem. Mnuchin over the weekend announced he had called CEOs of major U.S. banks from his vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and assured them the markets had ìample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations.îThe unusual calls left the CEOs ìtotally baffled,î according to CNN,†and Mnuchinís perplexing statement injected a fresh dose of uncertainty into jumpy markets, The New York Times observed.†ìItís Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,î Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement on Monday. ìThe stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve ñ†after he just fired the Secretary of Defense.îThe Democratic leaders added that Trump is beholden to ìright-wing radio and TV hostsî on the issue of the wall, and that ìdifferent people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not,î making it impossible to negotiate.†ìThe president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it,î the Democratic leaders said. ìAs long as the president is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, itís hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his Trump Shutdown.îSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), meanwhile, had a more pithy response to Trumpís grievances on Twitter.Hey republicans your guy is having a moment let us know if you come up w a plan to fix.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.A source told CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta just days after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis tendered his resignation that the president was furious by news coverage of the event because it resurrected the ìadult daycareî idea for the president.

But it canít due to Americaís partial government shutdown, which began Saturday after President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation that didnít include funding for his southern border wall.The USGS website is dormant as of Sunday, except for a notice at the top. ìDue to a lapse in appropriations, the majority of USGS websites may not be up to date and may not reflect current conditions,î the note reads. ìWebsites displaying real-time data, such as Earthquake and Water and information needed for public health and safety will be updated with limited support.îAccording to the government shutdown contingency plan, the USGS will retain just 75 of its estimated 8,032 employees, or 0.9 percent.ìThe USGS will suspend the majority of its activities with the exception of those functions to protect life and property,î the plan states. The document also claims that 450 employees will be ìon callî for natural disasters, but itís unclear if that process has been enacted, as the USGS website says the agency is not ìable to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted.îWhile scientific experts in Indonesia lead the way in analyzing the data, seismologists and volcanologists on Twitter stress how important agencies like the USGS are in providing valuable scientific data to the public.†ìThis is problematic for journalists like myself, but also itís a shame they canít help out by providing any commentary or advice to the general public too,î volcanologist Robin George Andrews told HuffPost.The USGS is just one of many science-based government agencies affected by the shutdown.

But seismic data are still being collected and distributed, and scientists are still engaged in hazards monitoring and response. https://t.co/eyH7aLsluqIf you're laughing at scientists who specialize in natural disasters being upset at the #TrumpShutdown endangering lives, you're a jerk. People just died in a #tsunami likely due to a #volcano erupting, & there is no guarantee the US won't be next on the natural disaster list.Officials say that since there was no detectable quake prior to the tsunami, there was no way to know it was coming.Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the head of public relations at Indonesiaís National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told CNN that a ìmulti-hazard early warning systemî is needed.ìWe used to know that a tsunami happens after an earthquake. There was no quake last night,î Nugroho said. ìThat is why there was no warning.îIndonesians have barely had a chance to catch their breath since their last natural disaster, suffering a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and ensuing tsunami back in September.

Republicans, including Pence,†even told reporters afterward they had confidence that the president would sign it into law and avert a shutdown.†Critical coverage by conservative radio talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter appeared to have pushed Trump toward favoring a veto, however. Coulter warned at one point that Trumpís administration could become a ìjoke presidency who scammed the American peopleî if he wasnít able to get the wall built and said she wouldnít vote for him in 2020 if he didnít.†During a hallway interview on Capitol Hill, a perplexed Corker,†the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, lamented that Trump is being controlled by the opinions of talk-radio hosts, equating their influence over the last 24 hours to ìtyranny.îìWe have two talk radio hosts who influenced the president,î Corker told CNN. ìThatís tyranny, isnít it?îReacting to that interview on Sunday, Trump tweeted that the senator decided to retire because he refused to endorse Corkerís re-election bid. A top aide to Corker denied that claim last year, however. The aide said the president initially asked the senator to reconsider his decision to retire and that Trump even offered his endorsement.Corker shot back with a tweet of his own on Sunday, alluding to a comment he made in October 2017 calling the White House ìan adult day care center.îYes, just like Mexico is paying for the wall... #AlertTheDaycareStaff https://t.co/4LwrkrSFFrThis story has been updated to include a reaction from President Donald Trump and Sen.

Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), whose term expires next month, aired his aggravation not only with the commander in chief on whom he pinned the blame, but also with his own party.ìIn the land of common sense <U+2015> weíre not in it right now, and the shutdown is because the president wanted a shutdown,î Costello said. ìI donít know why he wanted a shutdown. If itís over the border wall, then this past summer, he should have pushed the compromised immigration bill that if heíd pushed, we would have been able to send it over to the Senate.îThe proposal to which Costello referred was rejected by the House last June, but would have forked over a whopping $25 billion for the presidentís border wall, five times his current asking price. The demands of Trump and other Republicans for border wall money have now led to a stark divide in Congress over the passage of a spending bill, triggering the shutdown.On Friday, Costello tweeted that it was ìtoddler logicî to think the impasse would cause those on the left to change their minds.If and when the gvt shuts down, thereís no pressure on Dems. Then Dems control the House on Jan 3. Then Dems have more leverage. The notion that a shutdown creates more pressure on Dems is toddler logic. https://t.co/4veTNOF9XwCostello predicted the turmoil wouldnít end until he was out of office, suggesting Democrats would hold out until they assume control of the House in January.Still, the congressman maintained frustration with his side of the aisle.<U+2033>This honestly is really, really simple stuff.

Earlier Friday, Trump blamed Democrats for holding up legislation that would include money needed for his border wall and threatened a ìvery longî shutdown.ìThe Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,î Trump tweeted. ìIf the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time.

At least thatís what he said on Fox News ó when he was talking about Barack Obama in 2013.Trump revealed his views when he was asked on ìFox & Friendsî about a pending government shutdown which occurred over a funding battle in October that year.ìBoardroom here,î said host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, referring to Trumpís reality TV show ìThe Apprentice,î in which he summarily fired people. ìWhoís getting fired? Whoís going to bear the brunt of the responsibility if indeed there is a government shutdown?î she asked Trump, who had called in to the program.ìIf you say who gets fired it always has to be the top,î Trump responded.† ìProblems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. And the presidentís the leader. Heís got to get everyone in a room and heís gotta lead. But he doesnít do that,î Trump added, referring to Obama.†ìAnd thatís why you have this horrible situation going on in Washington. Itís a very, very bad thing and itís very embarrassing worldwide.îHe also noted that when people look back on a shutdown in history, theyíre ìgoing to be talking about ... who the president was at that time. Theyíre not going to be talking about who was the head of the House, the head of the Senate, whoís running things in Washington.îSeveral federal departments and agencies were shut down Friday at midnight as funding lapsed after Trump switched his position on signing a temporary funding bill and refused instead to support any measure that didnít include some $5 billion for his border wall. The House and Senate have adjourned for the holidays and members likely will not be meeting in anyoneís office until at least Thursday.Trump, who had said earlier this month that he would be ìproudî to shut down the government for ìborder securityî is now calling it a ìDemocrat shutdown.îThe Democrats now own the shutdown!Listen to Trumpís views about a presidentís responsibility for a shutdown in the clip above.He also told Larry King in a 2013 interview that the U.S. was ìbeing scoffed at and laughed atî because of the shutdown. ìItís a mess,î he said.

And in the meantime, the discussions, and the negotiations, continue,î McConnell said, just hours after Trump held a White House lunch that didnít include any Democrats with whom McConnell has repeatedly said Trump must negotiate.Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) took to the Senate floor, where he said the shutdown was caused by exactly one person: Trump. ìPresident Trump has been on a destructive, two-week temper tantrum, demanding that the American taxpayer pony up for an expensive and ineffective border wall that the president promised Mexico would pay for,î Schumer said.Trump has made zero overtures to the Mexican government since the start of his presidency to get that country to pay for the wall, according to a top official in Mexico City.A senior Trump administration official, who spoke to reporters Saturday on condition of anonymity, claimed Trump is still looking for ways to get Mexico to pay.ìWeíre going to put to the future questions about how and when Mexico will pay for it. Our administration continues to believe that they will,î the Trump official said. ìBut this debate is about ensuring that we have the appropriations that are needed to get the wall built. Weíre not going to be in a situation where weíre going to wait on negotiations with Mexico to be able to move out in constructing the wall.îMcConnell could recall senators to the Capitol to vote on a possible deal before Thursday. Alternatively, the House could pass a short-term spending bill already approved by the Senate and send it to Trump for his signature.In the absence of either of those scenarios, nine Cabinet agencies <U+2015> including the Department of Homeland Security and its Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents <U+2015> and a total of some half-million federal employees will remain in paycheck limbo through at least the Christmas holiday.The Senate spending bill extension that passed by a unanimous voice vote on Wednesday continued last yearís appropriation level of $1.6 billion for border security enhancements, of which $1.3 billion was for repair and replacement of existing barrier fence.Trump had been expected to sign that bill without much fuss <U+2015> until Thursday morning, after Trump watched his favorite Fox News hosts attack him for not building the border wall he had promised.The House, which had planned to approve the Senate-passed spending bill and then adjourn for the year, instead added $5.7 billion in unspecified border security money for Trumpís wall <U+2015> a proposal that does not have even 50 votes in the Senate, let alone the 60 it would need to pass.Spending authority for the affected departments and agencies expired at midnight Friday.The shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays this year. But nonessential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential <U+2015> including Trumpís Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, ICE and the Coast Guard <U+2015> will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.Building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trumpís signature campaign promise, delivered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015, and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.The ìforcing Mexico to payî part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexicoís president at the time, Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing with his base.In recent months, Trump has been conflating the ìgreat, great wallî made of reinforced concrete that he had promised during his campaign with a ìbollard fenceî design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obamaís administration.Of late, Trump has suggested describing his promised wall as ìartistically designed steel slatsî so that Democrats wonít object to it as vociferously.Trump postponed the start of what was to have been a 16-day golfing vacation at his private resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday and remained in Washington instead. It is unclear whether he will stay at the White House until he signs a new spending bill or fly down to Mar-a-Lago in the coming days regardless.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

While a spending bill including that measure passed the GOP-led House, it was inevitably dead on arrival in the Senate.The problem,†Schumer and Pelosi contended, was Trumpís unrealistic and unreasonable plans for a wall.ìDemocrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security ñ not the presidentís ineffective and expensive wall.îIn the event that the government is not up and running soon, the lawmakers vowed to ìswiftly pass legislation to re-openî it in January once the House flips to a Democratic majority.†Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to Rep.

Many of them fully expected Hillary Clinton to become president. Instead, they found themselves with every politicoís dream: one-party control of the three branches of government.†ìWe are going to hit the ground running,î House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared, saying Donald Trump ìearned a mandateî to push his agenda forward as president.ìWe would like to see the country go in a different direction and intend to work with him to change the course for America,î Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared.†Two years later, the Republican dream is left in shambles. And voters were clearly not impressed with what the GOP Congress accomplished with its one-party rule. In January, Democrats will take control of the House.At midnight, the federal government partially shut down for the third time during Trumpís presidency after Republicans failed in their most basic duty as lawmakers: funding government operations.†ìWeíre right in the middle of a sort of meltdown on the part of the Republicans,î said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday. Pelosi is expected to become speaker in the new Congress.†Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), however, argued that this turmoil was normal.†ìIíve been in the state legislature for 14 years, six of those as speaker. Iíve been here for 20 years,î he told reporters Thursday. ìIíve never seen it not end this way. The last week of a legislative session is ugly. Always is.îBut itís not always this ugly. When then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) retired in 2015, he cleaned up the place. He pushed through a two-year spending deal and a two-year raise in the federal borrowing limit, theoretically allowing Congress to get other things done so they wouldnít have to waste time lurching from crisis to crisis.†And the messiness wasnít restricted to this past week.†Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who left Congress in 2017 and recently gave up his party affiliation, said the Republican Partyís unified control of government was ìdefined by remarkably damaging wins and complete capitulation of separation of powers.îSince the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Republicans made repealing it their rallying cry. Up until the 2018 campaign, it was their central political message. But the ACA turned out to be far more popular than they anticipated and repealing it was far harder than expected as well <U+2015> despite controlling both chambers of Congress. Trump and his Republican allies continue to weaken the law, but there was no all-out repeal as promised.†Congressí biggest legislative accomplishment was passing the new tax law, but it fell far short of what was promised. There were deep, permanent cuts for corporations, and a more modest cut for individuals that expires at the end of 2025. The tax bill was not as popular as Republicans expected, and they largely abandoned it as a campaign message.†The tax law also contributed to a complete abandonment of the GOPís stated concern about fiscal responsibility.†When Barack Obama was president, Republicans hammered him on the national debt. ìAmerica Canít Afford Obamaís Legacy Of A Skyrocketing National Debtî read a typical document on the Republican National Committeeís website in 2017. When the national debt was at $15 trillion in 2012, Ryan warned of the ìred tidal wave of debtî that would mean the ìend of the American dreamî in as little as two or three years.†But itís 2018, and the national debt has grown to $21 trillion under the GOPís watch. The federal governmentís budget office projects the GOPís tax law will add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years. So much for fiscal austerity.One bright spot for Republicans is the criminal justice reform bill that passed on a strong bipartisan basis this month. The bill is designed to help nonviolent federal offenders make an easier return to society after theyíve served most of their sentences. It also trimmed a handful of mandatory minimum sentences, such as for crack cocaine, that helped explode the federal prison population over the past three decades. Most Republicans probably wouldnít have supported such a bill without cover from a president like Trump, who does ìtough on crimeî politics like itís still the 1980s.†That same macho impulse, however, is what led to the government shutdown, with Trump insisting Congress appropriate billions of dollars for a giant wall to keep ìbad guysî from crossing the southern U.S. border. Itís such a ridiculous idea that Republicans in Congress try to pretend the presidentís talking broadly about†ìborder securityî and not a physical barrier made out of concrete or steel.Ryan and McConnell could have sent the president a clean funding bill and dared him to veto it <U+2015> instead, they played along with his demand and made a show of holding votes, even though it was clear Democrats wouldnít go along.†And while Senate Republicans did push through two conservative Supreme Court nominees, they largely overlooked or dismissed sexual misconduct allegations against one:†Brett Kavanaugh, who was rushed ahead for confirmation without the usual vetting.†But most notably, the Republican majority will be remembered for what it didnít do: It didnít stand up to Trump.†ìCongress spent two years behaving as a political committee of the president, not a branch of government empowered with independence by the Constitution,î Jolly said.Congress never passed legislation protecting Robert Muellerís special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign. Ryan frequently dismissed Trumpís concerning rhetoric and actions <U+2015> like attacking fellow Republicans or outright lying <U+2015> calling it ìnoiseî or ìtrolling.îItís a fitting finale to this two-year period that in the end, the government is literally not even open.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Whether it results in anything close to the billions he had demanded for wall construction is unclear <U+2015> and may well be beside the point.Also unclear is how long the shutdown will last. Trumpís allies in the House added $5.7 billion in wall construction money onto a spending bill that had already cleared the Senate. That additional money remains a non-starter in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass controversial legislation and where there are only 51 Republicans.Trump, meanwhile, has already begun blaming Democrats for forcing the shutdown, even though he himself caused it by changing his mind at the last minute and insisting that the short-term spending bill moving through Congress include an unspecified amount of money for his wall.ìItís up to the Democrats.†So itís really the Democrat shutdown,î the president said Friday during an unrelated bill signing ceremony at the White House.Just 10 days earlier, though, in that same Oval Office, Trump had bragged to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that he would be happy to take the responsibility for a shutdown.ìIíll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,î Trump said. ìI will be the one to shut it down. Iím not going to blame you for it.îThree-quarters of the federal government has already been funded through next September under spending bills that Trump signed previously. But a handful of major agencies received only temporary funding because of the presidentís earlier insistence that Congress start building his border wall, which Democrats refused to go along with.The last of those funding extensions expired at midnight Friday. Both Trump and his White House had signaled during the first part of the week that he would accept another extension, this time through Feb. 8. By that point, Pelosi will have been sworn in as the new speaker, since the Democratic Party picked up 40 House seats in the midterm elections.Some Trump allies believe that he will have an easier time negotiating a longer-term deal with her, offering to agree to some Democratic priorities in return for his wall. Other observers think that he has always preferred to attack Democrats over the lack of a wall than to actually build one, so that a Pelosi speakership will wind up being useful to him politically.All those calculations changed Thursday morning, though, following a night and a morning of harsh criticism from Fox News hosts and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Trump announced that he would reject any short-term spending bill that did not offer more money for border security, although he did not specify an amount.Building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trumpís singular campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times between June 2015 and Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.The ìforcing Mexico to payî part, though, was quietly dropped almost immediately upon his taking office. In a phone call with Enrique PeÒa Nieto, Mexicoís president at the time, Trump said that he understood Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked PeÒa Nieto not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.In recent months, Trump has been conflating the ìgreat, great wallî made of reinforced concrete that he promised during his campaign with a ìbollard fenceî design of steel posts that was adopted and started during President Barack Obamaís administration.Of late, he has suggested describing his wall as ìartistically designed steel slatsî so Democrats wonít object to it as vociferously.The shutdown will have little effect through the weekend and even on Monday, Christmas Eve, and Tuesday, Christmas Day, which are both federal holidays. But non-essential employees at the affected departments will be furloughed starting Wednesday, while employees considered essential <U+2015> including Trumpís Secret Service detail and many tens of thousands of workers in the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard <U+2015> will be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.Trump postponed the start of what was to have been a 16-day golfing vacation at his private resort in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday and remained in Washington instead. It is unclear whether he will stay at the White House until he signs a new spending bill or fly down to Mar-a-Lago in the coming days regardless.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Trump has blamed the stateís infernos on everything from a lack of raking to a nonexistent water shortage†resulting from ìbad environmental laws.î And the administration has used the disasters to push partisan policy,†connecting devastating California wildfires to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources.ìFor decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires,î Trumpís order reads. ìThese conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other Federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires.îThe order directs the Interior Department and the Department of Agriculture to identify ways to reduce ìregulatory barriersî to better manage forests and get rid of hazardous fuels. It calls for ìtreatingî 4.25 million federal acres ó an area larger than Connecticut ó to cut fuel loads. And it allows for a total 4.4 billion board feet of timber to be harvested from Forest Service- and Interior-managed lands in 2019 (board feet is a unit of measurement for the volume of lumber).That would be a significant increase over the combined 3.2 billion board feet removed from those agenciesí lands in 2017, the Sacramento Bee reports.††ìActive management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed due to challenges associated with regulatory analysis and current consultation requirements,î the order states.†The order also calls for addressing invasive species and working to mitigate flooding and erosion risks that result from wildland fires. And it requires the agenciesí secretaries to ìidentify salvage and log recovery options from lands damaged by fire during the 2017 and 2018 fire seasons, insects, or diseaseî by no later than March 31, 2019.While the order lists a number of forest threats made worse by climate change <U+2015> drought, disease, insect infestations, invasive species <U+2015> it ignores climate change as a whole. That comes as little surprise, given the misinformation and climate change denialism that the administration rolled out in response to the fires in August.ìIíve heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change,î Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told KCRA-TV in Sacramento during a trip to assess damage from the Carr fire. ìThis has to do with active forest management.îZinke, who is resigning at the end of the year amid numerous federal investigations into his conduct and policy changes, has gone so far as to blame the blazes on ìenvironmental terroristsî who he claims are standing in the way of forest management. He echoed that sentiment in an interview that aired Friday on Fox News.†ìThose who want to wrap [public lands] up in bubble wrap are fully content with watching our forests burn down,î he said.†The Carr fire this summer <U+2015> then the sixth most destructive on record in California <U+2015> burned more than 200,000 acres, destroyed 1,600 structures and killed seven people, including three firefighters. Novemberís Camp fire <U+2015> the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californiaís history <U+2015> engulfed more than 153,000 acres, killing at least 85 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes.Scientific research has shown that climate change is contributing to the extreme fires raging across the West. It is true that the accumulation of fuel is a factor that contributes to increased fire activity; however, a 2016 study found that human-caused climate change had doubled the amount of land that burned in Western forests over a 30-year period by significantly drying out vegetation.Denise Boggs, director of Conservation Congress, a forest and wildlife advocacy group in California, told the Sacramento Bee that Trumpís executive order wonít work.ìAll the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You canít log your way out of this situation,î Boggs told the paper. ìLogging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry.î"

Nine departments and several agencies with hundreds of thousands of workers began grinding to a halt following a legislative impasse after President Donald Trump†threatened to close down part of the government if he didnít get funds for his border wall.The shutdown was assured when both the House and Senate adjourned Friday without reaching any compromise. Government funding for the departments and agencies lapsed at midnight.†ìWe are hopeful that this lapse in appropriations will be of short duration,î White House budget chief and incoming chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a memo to government executives. Employees should report to work when scheduled to ìundertake orderly shutdown activities,î he added, The Associated Press reported.Legislators scrambled throughout the day Friday to work out an arrangement to avoid a shutdown.There was chatter around Capitol Hill that Vice President Mike Pence was close to brokering a last-minute deal with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), but nothing materialized.†House members could return from recess at noon Saturday. But the House doesnít intend to vote on anything else until there is action in the Senate. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told members he didnít expect any House votes on Saturday. He also said heíd give lawmakers ìampleî warning before there was a vote.ìWeíre totally prepared for a very long shutdown,î Trump threatened Friday, blaming the lapse in appropriations on the unwillingness of Democrats to pass $5.7 billion in funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ìThis is our only chance that weíll ever have ... to get great border security.î†Shortly before the House adjourned at 7 p.m., Trump tweeted that he was still awaiting a spending decision and that he had canceled his planned holiday departure to Mar-a-Lago.Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect Americaís Southern Border! pic.twitter.com/ws6LYhKcKlTrump has refused to sign any spending bill that doesnít include funding for his wall. But such legislation would be doomed in the Senate, where Republicans wouldnít be able to secure the required 60 votes <U+2015> or potentially even 50 votes.The Senate spent hours Friday holding a vote open, hoping that more GOP senators would come back to D.C. and agree to consider a bill passed by the House that contained money for a border wall. Eventually, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) switched his vote and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) voted yes to tie the vote at 47-47. Pence then broke the tie, allowing the Senate to proceed to the House-passed bill.But Corker and Flake said they supported the motion with the understanding that the next thing the Senate votes on would not be the House legislation with wall money. ìThere is no path forward for the House bill,î Flake flatly declared.Instead, the Senate intends to continue negotiating and not hold a vote on anything else until there is an agreement between Republicans, Democrats, the House, the Senate and the White House.McCarthy said the House wouldnít be back until the Senate had acted in some way, meaning Republicans donít plan on folding and passing the clean continuing resolution that passed the Senate unanimously earlier this week.Republicans are now holding out for something <U+2015> even if itís a face-saving deal.Even if lawmakers do strike a compromise <U+2015> such as giving Trump the original $1.6 billion for border security (but not a wall), which Democrats had offered weeks ago <U+2015> itís unlikely House conservatives would go for it. That means Trump may have to sign a bill without the support of a majority of the House GOP conference.Itís also unclear at this point if House Democrats would support such a compromise <U+2015> an even more pressing question since they might be expected to supply the majority of the votes to pass a deal.At this point, there doesnít appear to be any easy agreement in the immediate offing. The weekend is starting and federal workers have Monday and Tuesday off for Christmas holidays, but a shutdown could extend past Tuesday.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has so far refused a vote on the clean continuing resolution, but he could likely get that bill to the presidentís desk if he allowed one.That bill, which would continue current spending on the remaining unfunded agencies through Feb. 8, does not include wall money, and Trump has said he wonít sign it. But as the political and practical effects of a shutdown become real <U+2015> furloughed workers, missed paychecks for government employees and contractors <U+2015> itís still possible for Trump to punt again on this fight.Itís also possible this shutdown could last indefinitely.Trump hasnít shown much willingness to cave since he indicated to House leaders that he wouldnít sign a bill without border wall funding, and heís been emboldened by a successful House vote to add $5.7 billion in funding for the wall.The shutdown will affect about 25 percent of government agencies, including Homeland Security, Justice, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture and State. It will stop the pay of around 800,000 government employees and contractors.Most of the government has already secured funding through the year, with the Pentagon, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services all getting their funding through an earlier appropriations bill this year. Their operations ó along with the legislative branchís ó wonít be impacted. Others, such as the federal courts, have secured temporary funding to keep them open for several weeks in the event of a shutdown.†But for the federal workers affected by this shutdown, this could be a painful lapse in appropriations. Those workers wonít receive a paycheck until thereís a deal.This is a developing story. Check back for updates.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

The wall, which Trump has repeatedly promised, still has not been started as Washington braces for a government shutdown†over the presidentís demand for taxpayer funding.ìIf we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians,î Kolfage wrote on the GoFundMe page for the wall campaign.More than 180,000 people had donated a staggering $12 million as of Friday morning. Kolfage is still eons away from his $1 billion goal, and itís unclear what will happen to the money. As USA Today noted, private citizens need congressional approval before they can donate money directly to the Department of Homeland Security.Kolfage told HuffPost he had ìseveral options on the table,î including donating the money to an unspecified charity that he said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) recommended. He also said he didnít know how long he would keep the fundraiser open, but that it wouldnít be indefinite.ìWe donít know [what comes next], weíre just playing it by ear,î he said. ìWeíre waiting to see what happens with the wall itself.î†Kolfage said he has discussed the fundraiser with someone in the White House ìinner circle,î but he declined to say who.†Unlike other fundraising websites, GoFundMe doesnít automatically return donations if a goal isnít reached.†Kolfage said the charity website wouldnít allow him to choose a higher target than $1 billion, which is only 20 percent of the funding Trump has requested from Congress for the wall.And what if Congress does end up paying for the wall? Kolfage said he would try to return the donations but claimed he has already gotten pushback from participants who donít want to see their money returned.ìThe American people want the wall,î he said.Meanwhile, a number of opposing fundraising efforts have popped up in response to the wall campaign, including one for ladders and another to build an escalator.†A statement on Kolfageís GoFundMe page insists the fundraiser is not a scam because ì[p]eople who try to scam you will not be upfront with their information.îHowever, Kolfage failed to disclose that he once ran a series of Facebook pages that were shut down in a crackdown on spam. According to NBC News, the Facebook pages sent users to affiliate websites, using conspiracy theories and racist content to drive traffic.Kolfage told The Guardian at the time that the Facebook crackdown was ìa complete shock.î He then created a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for a legal effort to revive the pages.†ìFacebook shut down my primary source of income by deleting my pages,î he wrote, claiming he was working with a ìmajor law firm.îKolfage told NBC News he didnít disclose the Facebook controversy on the wall website because ìmy personal issues have nothing to do with building the wall.îKolfage, who is a triple amputee, also made waves in 2015 over his opposition to a rainbow flag seen at an Arizona Air Force base. He called the flag <U+2015> an apparent gay pride symbol <U+2015> a ìperversion of Old Gloryî†in an article for the Blaze.In other articles for the conservative site, Kolfage attacked a prominent imam for speaking Arabic at a Veterans Day event and claimed without evidence†that a former adviser to then-President Barack Obama was sympathetic to terrorists.This article has been updated to include comments from Kolfage and some of his history of controversy.†Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

This week, as the federal government faces a possible shutdown over Trumpís insistence on more funding for border security, the wall of his campaign trail appears to be nowhere in sight.Hereís a brief look at Trumpís evolution in talking about that wall:Trumpís vow that he would ìbuild the wallî was unequivocal throughout his campaign and reiterated in one way or another in almost every rally, speech and interview.The promise went more or less along the lines of this comment to CNN in July 2015:ìI will build the wall and Mexicoís going to pay for it and they will be happy to pay for it. Because Mexico is making so much money from the United States that thatís going to be peanuts. And all these other characters say, ëOh, they wonít pay, they wonít pay.í They donít know the first thing about how to negotiate. Trust me, Mexico will pay for it.îIn the days following Trumpís presidential win, the wall proposal developed some holes. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was one of Trumpís earliest and most prominent supporters leading up to the election, admitted shortly afterward that the whole business about Mexico paying for the structure was little more than a ìgreat campaign device.î And Trump told CBS just days after his victory that he would be open to the idea of a fence.†ìWould you accept a fence?î the president-elect was asked by ì60 Minutesî correspondent Lesley Stahl.ìFor certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate,î Trump responded. ìIím very good at this. Itís called construction.îStahl continued to press him, asking, ìSo part wall, part fence?îìYeah, it could be,î he said. ìIt could be some fencing.îBy May 2017, Trump was boasting that his administration was already beginning construction on the wall and that a government funding deal recently reached by Congress included a ìdown payment on the border wall.î (It didnít.)Then-budget director Mick Mulvaney clarified that the administration would be erecting a 20-foot-tall steel fence to replace existing portions of chain-link fencing along the border.Throughout the first half of 2018, Trump and administration officials were firmly declaring that construction on the wall had begun.ìItís not ëbuild that wallí anymore. Itís ëcontinue building that wall,íî the president said at a July rally in South Carolina. ìBecause weíre building it!îWhat he might have been referring to was what Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen described in April as more like upgrades on the existing barrier along portions of the southern border.†ìTo us, itís all new wall,î Nielsen said at a White House briefing. ìIf there was a wall before that needs to be replaced, itís being replaced by a new wall. This is Trumpís border wall.îThe truth is that not a single mile of new barrier has been constructed along the Mexican border during Trumpís presidency. As HuffPostís S.V. Date wrote earlier this month: ìThere were 654 miles of physical barrier on the day Trump was inaugurated president, and there are 654 miles today.îAs of December, the president was going with ìartistically designed steel slatsî to describe his still-promised wall.Trump addressed the possible government shutdown over border security issues ahead of signing the farm bill on Thursday afternoon. He reiterated some of his main talking points on the need for a border wall, but with his newly phrased caveat.ìAt this moment there is a debate over funding border security and the wall <U+2015> also called, so that I give them a bit of an out, ësteel slats,íî the president said. ìWe donít use the word ëwallí necessarily.îTRUMP on govt shutdown: ""At this moment there is a debate over funding border security and the wall -- also called, so that I give them a little bit of an out, 'steel slats.' We don't use the word 'wall' necessarily, but it has to be something special to do the job."" pic.twitter.com/n1uKFFa4UURudy Giuliani, one of Trumpís personal attorneys, also suggested on Thursday that the ìwallî could be more of a metaphor for increased border security, which could actually take a number of different forms.†He suggested using advanced technology to detect and capture undocumented immigrants instead.ìI donít see the magic in a wall, as long as thereís some form of improved barrier that picks up penetration,î Giuliani told CNBC. ìI could build a wall for him with long-range cameras and security. He needs something. I think heíd compromise if he got most of what he wanted.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Or will he find some way to claim he has ìwonî on the issue and fly south on schedule?Or will he truly defy expectations by rejecting a temporary spending bill and going to Palm Beach anyway amid a partial government shutdown?Americans will find out, one way or another, in this seasonís finale of the Donald Trump presidency Friday.On Thursday, Trump brought shutdown fever to a boil with a tweet threatening a veto of a two-month spending package ó before appearing to talk himself down at a bill signing, where he said he wanted money for ìborder securityî and a physical barrier but not making specific demands about either.ìIíve made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,î Trump said in prepared remarks he delivered just before he signed this yearís farm bill into law. He added that money must also be there for some type of barrier. ìWeíll see what we can do. Hopefully, that will all come together.îNotably, though, Trump did not name a dollar figure for what he would need to sign the bill. Nor did he state what project or projects would have to be funded.The spending bill extension passed by the Senate late Wednesday continues funding at a $1.6 billion annual rate for refurbishing and upgrading the existing fence on about one-third of the U.S.-Mexico border ó thus meeting both of Trumpís stated requirements.Whether thatís enough for Trumpís hard-core base is unclear.North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally, said the word from residents in his district was ìget it doneî and that ìwe build it.îìWhat I heard very loudly and very clearly from my constituents is they donít want us to just give up on this particular issue, and so itís important that we fight on their behalf,î he said.Trump earlier in the day wrote on Twitter that the Senate-passed bill was not good enough. ìWhen I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW),î Trump wrote. ìIt didnít happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!îHours later, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Meadows and fellow Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) met with Trump at the White House, after which Ryan said Trump made it clear he would not sign what the Senate passed.ìThe president informed us that he will not sign the bill that came up from the Senate last evening because of his legitimate concerns for border security,î Ryan said afterward.That, though, was not long before Trump seemed to soften his demands at the farm bill signing.If Thursdayís spending bill crisis seemed familiar, thatís because it was a repeat of an episode from earlier in the year, when Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill to keep the entire government funded through the end of the budget year in September.Trumpís budget director held a press briefing the day before the scheduled signing and assured reporters that Trump would sign the measure, even though it had no money for the border wall.But that night and the following morning, Trumpís readiness to approve a spending package that was that big but did not include even a single dollar to build the wall that he had promised was hammered on by Fox News hosts. Trump responded with a tweet suggesting he would veto the package. Congressional Republicans scrambled to talk Trump out of that threat.Trump wound up signing the bill, claiming he was doing so because of all the money it contained for the military, and vowed not to sign another one if it did not include wall money.But he has since approved two more funding bills for the Department of Homeland Security that did not contain money for the border wall. The first was in September, at the urging of congressional Republicans who warned that a shutdown so close to the November midterms would hurt them. The second was two weeks ago, because of the death and subsequent state funeral of former President George H.W. Bush.And Thursdayís heightened, then lowered shutdown tensions follow a week of such oscillations. Last week Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), that he would be ìproudî to shoulder the responsibility for a partial shutdown.Since then, though, the White House sent signals that Trump was seeking to avoid a shutdown. First, it said that a compromise number between the $1.6 billion that Democrats support and the $5 billion that Trump wants would be acceptable. And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday that Trump would be able to find money for his wall from other sources.Critical coverage on Fox and by radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in the past two days appeared to have yet again pushed Trump toward favoring a veto. Limbaugh on Thursday told his listeners that Trump had, during the program, assured him that he would veto a bill that did not pay for his wall.Trump promised many hundreds of times during his campaign that American taxpayers would not have to pay anything for his 30-foot-tall, concrete ìgreat wallî because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But nearly two years into his presidency, Trump has yet to publicly broach the subject even a single time with that countryís leaders.The make-Mexico-pay part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexicoís president at the time, according to leaked transcripts published by the Washington Post,†Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.About three-quarters of the federal workforce would be unaffected by a partial shutdown, as their agencies were funded through September 2019 in earlier spending bills. A partial shutdown that would start at midnight Friday would affect the departments of Homeland Security, State, the Treasury and the Interior. Many of the affected employees would be deemed essential and be forced to work anyway. None would be paid during the shutdown and would have to get by on savings or short-term loans.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) to head a revived U.S. House panel on climate change, all but ending a dramatic monthlong effort to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal.Castorís appointment came as a surprise to proponents of a Green New Deal. The move also kicked off a controversy as the six-term congresswoman dismissed calls to bar members who accept money from fossil fuel companies from serving on the committee, arguing it would violate free speech rights.†Despite weeks of protests demanding House Democrats focus efforts next year on drafting a Green New Deal, the sort of sweeping economic policy that scientists say matches the scale of the climate crisis, Castor told†E&E News the plan was ìnot going to be our sole focus.îShe then suggested that barring members who have accepted donations from the oil, gas and coal industries from serving on the committee could be unconstitutional.†ìI donít think you can do that under the First Amendment, really,î she said.That reasoning echoed arguments Exxon Mobil Corp. made in court as recently as this year to defend its funding of right-wing think tanks that deliberately produced misinformation about climate science to stymie government action on global warming.†Soon after the remarks were published, Castor walked back the statement in an interview with HuffPost,†calling it an ìinartful answer.îBut she said she did not know whether, as chairperson, she could bar members on the committee from serving if they accepted fossil fuel donations.†ìMaybe thatís a discussion we need to have in the caucus,î Castor said.†Itís a stunning upset, essentially returning Democrats to the original plan leaders laid out before the protests began in November. The announcement comes as a loss for Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Her meteoric rise and devoted base made it seem as if she were poised to win the burgeoning cadre of leftist Democrats a beachhead in a select committee that, even with limited capacity, would have demonstrated tangible power in Washington.†But, if itís defeat, itís bittersweet. The campaign, seemingly quixotic at first, shifted the stagnant climate policy debate not just to the left but, for the first time, in the direction of policies that could make a dent in surging global emissions and curb soaring income inequality. Coupled with back-to-back United Nations and federal reports that showed climate change already rapidly worsening, the effort established a new litmus test for lawmakers, breaking the binary of whether or not a politicians ìbelievesî in the science of human-caused warming.†The movement gained stunning support in just a few weeks. A poll released Monday found 81 percent of registered voters supported the policies outlined under the Green New Deal resolution <U+2015> including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last Friday, more than 300 state and local officials voiced support for a Green New Deal in an open letter.†ìWe donít have time to sit on our hands as our planet burns,î Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday in a tweet. ìFor young people, climate change is bigger than election or re-election. Itís life or death.îItís unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez will even get a seat on the select committee.†Asked if she accepted money from fossil fuel companies, Castor said, ìI cannot think of a contribution from an oil company or fossil fuel company, but I cannot say without going back and with a fine-toothed comb that there wasnít something in the past.îAccording to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Castor accepted more than $73,000 from the energy and natural resources sector over her 12-year tenure in Congress, including $60,000 from corporate political action committees. The League of Conservation Voters gave Castor an 86 percent score last year on its ranking, which is based on her voting record. She had a 93 percent lifetime score.†She said she would consider taking the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, a vow overseen by a handful of progressive groups including proponents of a Green New Deal. Asked what the decision hinged on, Castor said, ìI donít know.îìWeíre at year-end with a possible shutdown and I think the important thing is looking at folks for the committee who are ready to serve,î she said.†The restoration of the select committee on climate change puts an end to a month-long effort to replace it with a panel focused specifically on crafting a Green New Deal,†an umbrella term for a suite of policies that would include shifting the United States to 100 percent renewable energy over the next decade and guaranteeing high-wage, federally backed jobs to workers in outmoded industries.The proposal stormed into mainstream political debate over the past month after protesters from the progressive groups Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats held sit-ins in Pelosiís office. The demonstrations came in response to what they saw as plans for a tepid response to the climate crisis when the party takes control of the House next month.Ocasio-Cortez, a left-wing firebrand with a powerful online following, joined the protests and proposed swapping Pelosiís plan to restore the climate select committee with a plan for a panel devoted to the Green New Deal.†For a few weeks, it seemed likely to happen. More than 40 incoming or sitting House Democrats pledged to support the resolution, and nearly half a dozen senators announced their support for the effort, including at least three likely 2020 presidential contenders.†But the proposal ruffled feathers in Washington. Incoming chairmen of committees that traditionally oversee energy and environmental policy complained that a Green New Deal select committee would strip them of legislative power. And Beltway veterans privately expressed frustration that a cadre of insurgent freshmen, some of whom toppled long-time allies in primaries, were using their grassroots popularity to call shots.Democratic leaders responded in kind, declining to contact activists or Ocasio-Cortez before announcing plans to ignore the resolution and restore the previous climate select committee instead.†Representatives from Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats confirmed they were not told of the decision until they read about it on E&E News. Castor said she ìchatted with Rep.-elect Ocasio-Cortez, but not specifically on this.î†In a statement, Sunrise Movement said a select committee ìthat makes a plan for implementing a Green New Deal is an opportunity for Democrats in the House.î†ìWithout a mandate to create a plan and a requirement that its members donít take fossil fuel money, we are deeply concerned that this committee will be just another of the many committees weíve seen failing our generation our entire lives,î†Varshini Prakash, the Sunrise Movementís co-founder, said in a statement.Later Thursday evening, Sunrise political director Evan Weber said the group would continue the fight.†ìNancy Pelosi has the power to determine whether or not the Select Committee for a Green New Deal lives or dies,î Weber said. ìSunrise Movementís position is and will continue to be that itís not over until she makes it clear that itís over.î†But, earlier this week, Democratic leaders announced that a Green New Deal select committee would lack subpoena power, seemingly sounding the death knell for the resolution.†Castor said the select committee she agreed to chair would likely have subpoena power, but not legislative power. She said she did not know yet which individuals or companies she would use that power to investigate.††ìI honestly thought the Democratic Party leaders would see this opportunity,î said Waleed Shahid,†the communications director for Justice Democrats, a left-wing group championing the Green New Deal proposal.†ìItís infuriating to see a fellow Democrat basically parrot the talking points of the Koch Brothers when it comes to the very common-sense idea that any politician who accepts donations from the fossil-fuel corporations should not be allowed to legislate on climate change.î†But Castorís appointment won praise from establishment environmental groups.†ìRep. Kathy Castor is an outstanding choice to help lead the Houseís renewed focus on climate change,î John Bowman, senior director for federal affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. ìAs a longtime environmental champion, few are better suited to help shine a bright light on the threats Americans face from the climate crisis and advance the solutions we urgently need.îThis article has been updated with a statement from the Sunrise Movement that it plans to continue to fight for a select committee.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Trump has been shaky on another continuing resolution (CR) without wall money for some time, but he signaled Wednesday that he would probably sign such a bill. By Thursday, he had already changed his mind.The White House suggested earlier in the day that the president was unhappy with the legislation and had begun blaming Republican leaders for ìcavingî on funding for his plans for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.ìWhen I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership,î Trump tweeted Thursday morning. ìWould be done by end of year (NOW). It didnít happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!îWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump and reaffirmed the presidentís position. ìAt this moment, the president does not want to go further without border security.îPaul Ryan says Trump ìwonít sign this bill,î referring to a Senate-passed stop-gap spending bill to avoid a shutdown by Friday. Shutdown now appears far more likely. Trump had signaled to Hill earlier he would signTrump may still end up signing the CR, but it appears now that House Republicans will first try to pass a funding bill that includes wall money. That may also still be tough. If the legislation to keep some agencies open past Friday does include wall funding, itís unlikely that a single Democrat will vote for the bill. That would leave Republicans on their own to pass the measure <U+2015> and a healthy number of GOP absences makes that difficult.Thereís also the question of how many Republicans would vote against wall funding on policy concerns. There are at least a few House Republicans who have previously indicated theyíre opposed to paying for the wall, and conservatives who generally oppose funding bills on spending concerns have indicated they would only support a CR if it included wall money and asylum policy changes.Conservatives may already be backing off those policy riders. Freedom Caucus member Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost Thursday afternoon that he could potentially see conservatives backing off those earlier demands in the interest of trying to get the wall. But Republicans could shortly find themselves in the same position later Thursday, unable to pass CR with wall funding on their own, and with a president whoís signaling opposition to any other bill.Republicans could always pass the clean CR that the Senate passed by unanimous consent Wednesday night, but they would be doing so over the objections of the president and likely more than half of the GOP conference.Trump would then be in the awkward position of vetoing the legislation, or simply pocketing it and letting the clock run out on this Congress <U+2015> all while some government agencies are closed down over the holidays and workers arenít receiving their paychecks.Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting by watching Republicans squirm.Minority Leader Rep.†Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) slammed her GOP colleagues Thursday morning for being in the midst of a party ìmeltdown,î and she once again indicated wall funding was a ìnon-starter.îìThey have a lot of people who are missing, who are absent here, so they never did have the votes for their wall,î Pelosi said. ìBut they now donít even have a full complement of members here.îIf the government does shut down, thousands of federal workers will be sent home without pay beginning Saturday. The partial shutdown would affect about 25 percent of federal workers, but key functions of the government will remain open, including the military.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Heíd been caught in a trap <U+2015> lured into an auditorium by the promise of a speech about fiscal responsibility. Instead, President Barack Obama was lecturing the crowd about why it would be wrong to balance the budget by impoverishing old people. Obama didnít mention Ryanís name, but in Ryanís mind, the president might as well have addressed the speech to him. Everybody could see Ryan, just sitting there in the front row of an auditorium at George Washington University. One of his colleagues leaned over and asked if they should leave. No, Ryan said. They should stay; they were being watched. He had noticed a photographer with a camera mounted on a unipod, its long lens pointed straight at him. He sat rigidly in his chair. It had all been a setup. To Ryan, Obamaís breach of decorum in April 2011 <U+2015> in which he lightly criticized Ryanís budget while calling for entitlement reform himself <U+2015> was Exhibit A in the case against Obama. According to Ryan, it meant Obama was unwilling to work across party lines to solve policy problems. It was an affront to fiscal responsibility and the Beltway Norms. A stunning contrast between the two men <U+2015> one a partisan politician and the other a serious policy wonk.ìHis false attacks were offensive, even by the low standards for discourse and civility in Washington, D.C.,î Ryan recalled in his 2014 book, in which he devoted eight pages to the incident.The story has been retold in at least three books, with Ryan denouncing Obamaís ìdemagogueryî each time.In retrospect, of course, in light of the current presidentís constant depredations <U+2015> against civility, against the discourse, even against Ryan himself <U+2015> Obamaís speech was the political equivalent of using the wrong fork at a dinner party. The idea that the speech amounted to some great offense, by the standard Ryan has set not even six years later, is patently absurd. Whereas Obama didnít even mention Ryan by name in the infamous speech, President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Ryan directly, calling the House speaker ìweak and ineffectiveî and a ìBoy Scoutî and saying he ìknows nothing,î though Trump has more recently said he has come to appreciate Ryan ìlike a fine wine.î(Reminder: Trump doesnít drink.) While Ryan made a habit of bashing Obama <U+2015> his reaction to Obamaís last State of the Union address was to say Obama ìdegrades the presidencyî because Obama warned against then-candidate Trumpís divisive rhetoric <U+2015> he has famously stood by Trump, greeting the presidentís near-daily embarrassments with cheery unawareness. Even when Ryan couldnít avoid Trumpís scandals, he continued to praise Trump as ìthoughtful,î ìrefreshingî and ìexquisite.îItís all part of the fiction that Ryan chooses to live in <U+2015> a fiction in which Trump is restoring honor to the presidency and his behavior is to be downplayed, dismissed or outright ignored. And itís that blithe fiction, contrasted with our graphic, Trump-y reality, for which Ryan should be remembered.When Ryan leaves office in January, he will not have balanced the budget or fixed Congress or solved poverty or left our politics smarter or less divided. Instead, during his three-year tenure as speaker, the deficit has nearly doubled. The procedural problems in Congress are more daunting. Poverty isnít much different. And our politics are more partisan, less ideological, than maybe ever before.The version of Paul Ryan that he and his staff tried to project for years <U+2015> the image of a squeaky-clean numbers guy, rolling up his sleeves, solving tough policy problems <U+2015> is a sham. According to a number of†polls, many people now recognize him as a monumental partisan, a politician who won a reputation as a wonk because he was able to memorize a few lines from an actuarial table and then promptly ignore his own pledges to balance the budget when he had the chance. Ryan is the man who, perhaps more than anybody else, normalized Trump, who led reluctant Republicans back to Trump, who went along with the president even when he knew he shouldnít and traded his dignity for a tax cut.This week, Ryan and his office released a six-part video series on his decades-long quest to reform the tax code. But he didnít reform our tax code. When all the new guidance is issued, the 40,000-page tax code is likely to be even longer. He simply cut taxes <U+2015> or, at least, he didnít stand in the way. It turned out that cutting taxes by $1.5 trillion wasnít all that hard, as long as ìconservativesî were on board with not paying for tax cuts. The grand irony of ìtax reformî is that, for all the credit Ryan and his staff try to give him for the bill, the final legislation was closer to the principles that Freedom Caucus leaders like Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) laid out: a corporate rate at 20 percent, a bigger standard deduction and cuts that werenít paid for.Ryan wanted a bill that was at least mostly revenue-neutral (it ended up costing more than a trillion dollars over 10 years), that would allow individuals to fill out their tax returns on a postcard (that didnít happen) and that had a corporate rate closer to 25 percent (it ended up at 21 percent).He almost blew up the tax bill by insisting on a border adjustment tax to offset some of the cuts. It wasnít until he gave up on the BAT <U+2015> a tarifflike tax that would have increased prices on imports and also, theoretically, increased the value of the dollar <U+2015> that tax reform became a reality. And it was the Senate that played the biggest role in shaping the tax bill, with Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) deciding how much debt was acceptable to rack up. In conference, when differences between the two chambersí versions are resolved, legislators took the Senate version on a number of important provisions <U+2015> pass-through income, international regulations, the child tax credit <U+2015> and ditched a bunch of politically perilous, revenue-raising ideas from the House, like ending deductions on medical expenses and student loans.Ryanís signature achievement of tax reform is neither actually his nor actually an achievement. Yes, the economy is doing well. But there was low unemployment and economic growth before the tax cuts. A year after it was enacted, the bill remains unpopular. The stock market has basically run sideways since the GOPís tax bill was enacted <U+2015> the S&P 500 is down on the year <U+2015> and wages for workers have barely grown. The tax cuts were supposed to spur investment and put more money in everyoneís pocket. Instead, they prompted a small round of one-time bonuses, a huge number of stock buybacks and deficits that will persist for decades.And yet, in true Ryan form, he seeks out another round of feting, when most politicians would have the self-awareness to quietly exit out the back.Itís possible that he will hand over the speakerís gavel to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a partial government shutdown, because he and other Republicans refuse to level with Trump and tell him heís not getting his border wall. A short-term funding bill, looking more likely by the hour, would be more of the same avoidance. It would be stage one in the grieving process.But denial has been one of Ryanís favorite strategies with Trump. Ryan has been satisfied to try to influence government and the president at the periphery. When Ryan became aware recently that there were more than 10,000 unused work visas, he pushed through legislation making sure Irish nationals would have access to those visas. When Trump said he might try to end birthright citizenship, Ryan suggested such a move would have to come from Congress, which prompted Trump to say that Ryan ìknows nothingî about the issue and should be focused on holding the GOP majority <U+2015> something Ryan wasnít able to do. The speaker oversaw the largest Republican losses in 44 years.Ryan never responded to Trumpís diss. The direct insults from Trump never seemed to rankle Ryan the same way Obamaís indirect slights appeared to bother him.A simple truth of Ryanís career is that he spent every day fighting to help people who didnít need help. It was always about cutting taxes, and as big of a game as he talked on the debt, when he had the chance to do something about entitlements or spending, he cowered from the challenge.As part of his farewell tour, he†said in November that his two biggest regrets were failing to tackle immigration reform and not addressing the growing national debt. He also theorized that history would be kind to his speakership and the GOP Congress he ruled over, partly because of the tax cuts that passed under his watch.But thereís no evidence that the tax cuts are getting more popular or becoming more effective, and thereís no indication that Republicans are getting more serious about debt. To take the issue of debt seriously for a moment <U+2015> something Republicans (and Democrats) donít do <U+2015> weíve incurred enough debt at this point that the interest payments on our $21 trillion hole will ensure that we never see a balanced budget again without massive spending cuts and tax increases.For Ryan, this might not be much of a contradiction. Cutting taxes is core to the Republican mission, while the debt is a political tool used to bash Democrats and to justify welfare cuts. The media and the public just fell for the GOP ruse.ìHistory will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generationís defining challenge, chose to duck and run,î Ryan said of Obama†after the president once again criticized the House GOP budget in 2012.But when it was his party controlling Congress and the White House, during a time of economic prosperity, when Washington has traditionally looked to realign the federal budget, Ryan didnít shrink the deficit; he nearly doubled it, through a combination of spending increases and tax cuts. Legislation enacted since Trump took office will add†$2.7 trillion to the national debt. The tax cuts and spending bills enacted in fiscal 2018 alone will widen 2019ís deficit by $445 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the yearly deficit, which was $585 billion in fiscal 2016 <U+2015> the year Ryan took the speakership <U+2015> will be roughly $1 trillion when he leaves office.When Ryan announced his retirement from Congress in April, he cheered the spending increases for the military that Republicans locked into spending agreements. Those Pentagon plus-ups, paired with domestic spending increases to appease Democrats, have ballooned the deficit. In 2011, conservatives in Congress refused to go along with increases to spending or the debt ceiling without a plan to restrain the deficit. What they came up with was the Budget Control Act, which set caps for defense and nondefense spending for the next 10 years. Except lawmakers have refused to live by those caps. Congress has honored the spending limits exactly zero times. The Pentagon particularly seems unwilling to abide by the limits. And Republicans like Ryan cheer on the military budget increases, even as the Pentagon has never completed an audit.Ryan entered the speakership by saying he wanted to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. Weíve justified more than three dozen military operations in more than a dozen countries using the overly broad authorization from 2001. ìIt would be a good sign for American foreign policy to have a new one updating our AUMF,î Ryan said in December 2015.But he spent the next three years blocking a new AUMF, saying he wouldnít allow debate on any bill that would restrict the ability of the military to fight. Just last week, Ryan attached special instructions to a rule for the farm bill that would waive provisions in the War Powers Resolution so he could block debate on a resolution about U.S. support for a war in Yemen <U+2015> a war that has created what the United Nations called ìthe worst man-made humanitarian crisis of our time.î An estimated 85,000 Yemeni children have died from starvation associated with the war, and an additional 17 million Yemenis are at risk of malnutrition.Ryanís efforts to block debate on war are entirely consistent with his actions as speaker but totally inconsistent with his message as he took the gavel. He said he wanted to return to regular order, that he wanted to allow debate on bills and amendments on the House floor.Instead, there was one open rule during the entirety of his speakership, meaning there was only one bill to which members could offer any amendment they wanted, as long as it pertained to the bill and wasnít written on the fly. He oversaw what may go down as the most closed Congress of all time. And rather than address immigration or entitlement reform or war or guns or children being separated from their parents at the border or a bill protecting Robert Muellerís investigation, Ryan was satisfied to use the House to pass uncontroversial bills renaming post offices or selling federal land to pump up the number of bills the House passed and Trump signed.The Republican calls to read the bill <U+2015> calls that helped propel them to the majority in 2010 <U+2015> have been replaced with Ryan ramming through a 2,232-page bill funding the government 17 hours after leaders released the text. Amazingly, on the same day the House passed that bill, he said he had done ìa phenomenal jobî restoring regular order.On Wednesday, Ryan took to the Great Hall in the Library of Congress for yet another goodbye speech. It was almost exactly three years since Ryan delivered a speech in that room at the beginning of his speakership. But what was supposed to be a farewell was really more of the same calls he made in the past for reform <U+2015> on debt, on immigration and on poverty.As Vox recently remarked in a headline, ìPaul Ryan really wishes the House speaker would fix immigration and the debt.î Ryan is the speaker who didnít seem to realize that he had the power to do things, that he could do more than cut taxes and that achieving results would take more than grandiose speeches echoing hollowly through the Great Hall in the Library of Congress.One particular issue that Ryan simply seemed to give up on was poverty. After the 2012 presidential election, when he was mocked for a soup kitchen photo op in which he seemed to be washing pots and pans that were already clean, Ryan launched himself into what he called a ìpoverty tour.î He traveled the country visiting nonprofit organizations that sought to rehabilitate poor people with criminal histories or drug problems. He came up with a bunch of proposals that were basically a rebranding of welfare cuts, and he built his case for cutting assistance to the poor on a false claim: that the War on Poverty had failed.That is all consistent with the Ryan weíve all come to know. But one of the reasons he was able to con so many people for so long was that he wasnít incapable of coming up with an interesting idea from time to time. He had elements of self-reflection and regret, like when he said in early 2016 that it was wrong of him to have used the frame ìmakers and takers.îIn 2014, instead of simply claiming that government programs that help poor people actually make them worse off <U+2015> and that therefore antipoverty spending should be cut <U+2015> Ryan did something different. He said the government should hire case managers who could work with poor people to create a ìcustomized life plan to provide a structured roadmap out of poverty.îCase management was the centerpiece of his proposal to reform the federal governmentís antipoverty programs into an ìopportunity grant.î The proposal and the poverty tour figured prominently in his 2014 book, ìThe Way Forward,î which is the type of book politicians write when theyíre thinking about running for president. He portrayed poverty policy as a consistent area of concern during his career, ever since his days working as an aide to Jack Kemp, a former congressman who called himself a ìbleeding-heart conservative.î But commentators from both sides thought the idea of a ìcustomized life planî was weird. And so Ryan backed away. ìWeíre saying this is one of the things we recommend, but give the states the ability to try other ideas,î he†told HuffPost in 2014. After he became speaker and Trump became president, Ryan had a chance to make his poverty agenda a reality. Instead, he used his time and political capital trying to take health care from millions of poor people <U+2015> remember, the House GOP health care plan included $834 billion in cuts to Medicaid <U+2015> and then passing a tax cut. He gave up on poverty.He said Wednesday that solving poverty will require ìa great rethinking of how we help the most vulnerable among us.î And without a shred of self-awareness or irony, he urged his Republican colleagues to not ìlet this issue drift from your consciousness.î The sincerity with which Paul Ryan believed in the myth of Paul Ryan was perhaps why it was so effective. During his speech Wednesday, he decried how outrage had become a ìbrand,î how we all needed to disregard ìthe noise.îBut what Ryan deems noise and what he thinks warrants outrage have a distinctly partisan slant. When Trump tweeted that he was considering revoking the security clearances of his political enemies, Ryan said Trump was ìjust trolling.î When Trump attacks fellow Republicans†or when he lies outright†or suggests†breaking into the Democratic National Committee, thatís just to be ignored. ìAll this stuff you see on a daily basis on Twitter this and Twitter that ó forget about it,î Ryan said in October 2017.Except that was not how Ryan treated Obama. Ryan said Obama was the nationís worst president.†Ryan relentlessly attacked Obama and took horrible offense during the 2011 speech in which Obama agreed that the nation needed to tackle entitlements.In Bob Woodwardís telling, ìRyan felt betrayed. Heíd expected an olive branch. What he got was the finger.îWhat was the appalling criticism that Obama had made?One of the most egregious insults was that Obama noted Ryanís budget would transfer Medicare to a voucher system. ìAnd if that voucher isnít worth enough to buy the insurance thatís available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck ó youíre on your own,î Obama said.And how did the Congressional Budget Office describe†Ryanís budget? ìUnder the proposal, most elderly people who would be entitled to premium support payments would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.îObama wasnít wrong, though he would later tell Woodward he thought he made a mistake by embarrassing Ryan. Obama had accurately described what Ryanís proposal would do. Ryan was just upset that the reality of his budget didnít measure up to his inflated self-image, of a man whose ideas transcend politics, of a should-be president delivering speeches at a prestigious university or in the marbled Great Hall of the Library of Congress.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Trump has threatened to allow a shutdown of those agencies <U+2015> which include the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Interior ó if Congress fails to include $5 billion to start a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.But with Congress appearing unlikely to approve anything beyond the existing $1.6 billion for border security improvements ó but not a border wall ó Trumpís White House has started to signal that it might be able to get the money in other ways.ìWeíll see what happens. Itís too early to say,î Trump said during a Tuesday photo opportunity when he was asked about a possible shutdown. ìWe need border security.îHe promised many hundreds of times during his campaign that American taxpayers would not have to pay anything for his 30-foot-tall, concrete ìgreat wallî because he would force Mexico to pay for it. But nearly two years into his presidency, he has yet to broach the subject even a single time with that countryís leaders.Asked about that promise during a rare White House press briefing Tuesday, Sanders first claimed ó falsely ó that money transferred from other agencies did not constitute American taxpayer money. Then she claimed ó also falsely <U+2015> that the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump has rebranded as the United StatesñMexicoñCanada Agreement will effectively make Mexico pay for the wall.ìWeíre not asking Americans taxpayers for that. We are looking at existing funding through other agencies right now that we can draw on to do that immediately,î Sanders said. She added, referring to increased tax revenue from the modified trade deal, ìWe could pay for the wall four times over. ... Weíre talking about additional revenue that wouldnít have existed without the president getting a new deal.îBut trade economists say that only one provision of the revised deal would directly increase collections by the U.S. Treasury: a 2.5 percent tariff that would be imposed on cars made in Mexico that did not have at least 75 percent content made in North America. The current threshold is 62.5 percent.That provision would bring in only about $600 million a year ó nowhere near enough to pay for a $25 billion wall, even after two decades. More important, that tariff would be paid by those who purchase cars in the United States, not the government of Mexico.ìUltimately, whoís affected by the tariffs is the American consumer, who will pay more for cars,î said Monica de Bolle of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Funding for a number of agencies will lapse at midnight Friday, and if Republicans canít persuade Trump to give in on the wall <U+2015> at least temporarily <U+2015> there will be a shutdown over Christmas for many nonessential government workers.GOP leaders seem to be preparing to ask Trump to go along with a temporary continuing resolution (CR), perhaps buying them two or three weeks. But Trump has shown a total willingness to accept a shutdown this time around. He made no qualms last week about saying heíd accept the blame during a meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and he sent one of his most hard-line advisers <U+2015> Stephen Miller <U+2015> on the Sunday news shows to further suggest that he would not be caving.But the consensus on Capitol Hill is that this eventually ends with Republicans caving, one way or another.ìWeíre not winning this fight, and heís the only one who doesnít know it,î one senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Monday.Another senior Republican aide said that, if Trump were smart, heíd take a short-term CR and fight the Democrats in January. ìOtherwise, we shut it down over Christmas and Democrats are the heroes sending him clean CRs all of January and reminding everyone he shut the government down,î the aide said.And if you were looking for a sense of how likely a shutdown is at this point, this aide added that he had not bought a plane ticket home for Christmas yet.Capitol Hill sources said the White House was divided internally over whether Republicans should just agree to a CR or whether they should shut down government over Democrats not giving Trump border wall funding.Again, no one sees this ending with border wall money. Democrats have even backed off earlier offers to give Trump a sizable amount of funding in exchange for a renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program. But thereís a real question whether Trump and other Republicans think they need a shutdown to show the GOP base that theyíre fighting for their campaign pledges and that Democrats are standing in the way.Trump has repeatedly signaled he would shut down the government over a lack of border wall funding, only to reluctantly sign a bill at the last minute when GOP leaders assure him this is the best deal heíll get.Last spring, Trump was ready to shut it down until aides told him he wouldnít be able to go to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida for the weekend because of bad optics. ìFuck that,î Trump said, according to The Wall Street Journal, before calling a news conference to trash the bill that he had decided to sign.But this time Trump seems like heíll be harder to convince. House Republican leaders had debated passing a funding bill <U+2015> either for the Department of Homeland Security or for all the remaining agencies <U+2015> that included $5 billion for the wall. But they decided it would likely be too tough of a haul with all the GOP members who have decided not to show up for the lame-duck session, and that the bill would just further bring them down a rabbit hole. (For a bill to reach the presidentís desk, it needs 60 votes in the Senate, and Democrats in that chamber looked ready to block a bill if it got through the House, which was uncertain in the first place.)Instead, Republicans are waiting Trump out a bit more, with the Senate waiting on the House and the House out until Wednesday night, hoping that Trump will have some change of heart as it gets closer to a shutdown.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Other major agencies facing a shutdown include the departments of state, treasury and interior. Many of the affected employees would be deemed essential and be forced to work anyway. None would be paid during the shutdown and would have to get by on savings or short-term loans.Rick Tyler, a former aide to the man who engineered the last extended government shutdown in 2013, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that Trump will cave in the days to come.ìThe only leverage in shutting down the government is who gets the blame for it. And heís already taken the blame for it,î Tyler said, predicting that Trump will approve whatever Congress gives him.For now, Trump and his key immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, have once again been talking up the possibility of a partial government shutdown to force Congress to appropriate billions of dollars to pay for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border.ìWeíre going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall, to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,î Miller said Sunday to CBS News, adding that that would include, ìif it comes to it,î a shutdown.Top White House communications adviser Mercedes Schlapp was somewhat less assertive while talking to reporters Monday but insisted that Congress had to come up with more than the $1.6 billion that Democrats have agreed to spend on border security enhancements <U+2015> but not a ìwallî <U+2015> to resolve the problem.ìWe donít want to get to the point where we shut down the government,î she said. ìBut weíve got to find increased spending for border security.îBut House Republicans appear to lack the votes to pass a bill with the $5 billion in wall funding that Trump is demanding without Democratic help, while Senate Republicans need at least nine Democrats to pass a spending bill.How Trump will react if Democrats do not give him what he wants is unclear.Trump enjoying his favorite pastime at his private club while those sworn to protect his life with their own deal with cash-flow problems in their households would be tough to defend, meaning that Trump likely would cancel or postpone his golf vacation until a new spending bill is approved. Conversely, though, his love of golfing probably makes a shutdown unlikely to begin with.ìHeíll get mad and then sign it and claim the military is going to build the wall, which it wonít,î Tyler said. ìAnd then everybody will forget about it.îBuilding a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it was Trumpís signature campaign promise, uttered for the first time in his Trump Tower speech announcing his candidacy. He repeated it hundreds of times from June 2015 to Nov. 8, 2016, when he won the presidency.But the ìmaking Mexico payî part was quietly dropped almost immediately upon taking office. In a phone call with Mexicoís president at the time, Trump told Enrique PeÒa Nieto that he understood that Mexico would not pay for the wall but asked him not to say that publicly so Trump would not lose standing among his base.Since that January 2017 conversation, Trump has signed a half-dozen spending bills that cover DHS even though they included no money to build his wall. He appeared to come closest to vetoing one and forcing a shutdown last March, after he watched Fox News evening hosts criticize him for planning to approve a $1.3 trillion spending bill with zero dollars for his wall. He signed it anyway the following morning and said he did so because of all the money it contained for the military.Heading into the summer, Trump again started threatening to shut down the government at the end of the budget year in September if he didnít get his wall money, but then he started backing down as that deadline approached. He began arguing that he would have more leverage after the November midterm elections because of all the additional Republicans who would be elected.ìWeíre going to do it immediately after the election,î he said in a Fox News interview conducted from one of his rallies on Sept. 7. ìWe do it right after the election where, hopefully, frankly, it will be easy because weíll have more Republicans, not less.îBut Trump and Republicans got clobbered in the November midterms, picking up just two seats in the Senate despite having the most favorable map in decades while losing 40 seats in the House and control of that chamber.Which means that instead of gaining leverage by waiting until after the election, Trump lost a good deal of it <U+2015> an altered dynamic made clear during a meeting last week with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Both told him they were not interested in building the sort of wall he promised and urged Trump not to go forward with the shutdown.Schumer on Sunday repeated that theme during an interview with NBC News. ìWe should not let a temper tantrum, threats, push us in the direction of doing something that everybody, even our Republican colleagues, know is wrong,î Schumer said. ìIf the president wants to debate the wall next year, he canÖ. But he shouldnít use innocent workers as hostage for his temper tantrum to sort of throw a bone to his base.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

In fact, the opposite happens: The government wastes time and resources prepping for the shutdown, and then must catch up on missed work once the government reopens.In the meantime, workers temporarily go without their paychecks, consumer confidence dampens and the gross domestic product takes a small but noticeable hit.In short, shutting down the government is a self-inflicted and self-defeating move, particularly to the side that seizes ownership of the shutdown before it happens.The potential shutdown this week may be less costly than past shutdowns due to its limited scope. A shutdown happens when Congress and the White House canít agree on a deal to fund the federal government. But in this case, Trump and lawmakers have already signed off on funding bills covering roughly three-fourths of the money the government needs to operate.That means only certain agencies would be hit by a shutdown: the departments of transportation, agriculture, housing and urban development, interior,†and homeland security, among others. Those agencies are currently running on a short-term funding extension that ends on Friday night.Within those agencies, certain ìessentialî personnel would continue going about their jobs, to be paid retroactively once the government reopens. But a shutdown would lead to an estimated 380,000 furloughs, including 96 percent of personnel at NASA and 86 percent at the Commerce Department, according to Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Those workers would be out of a job until a deal is reached.Even though the country faces a much smaller shutdown than the last major one, in 2013, plenty of Americans would take notice. For instance, while the national parks would remain open, the workers who clean and care for them would be at home on furlough. (There have already been two brief shutdowns this year, in January and February.)Some hardcore Trump fans might enjoy the idea of sticking it to federal workers, whom the president equates with the ìswamp,î†while holding out for wall funding. But if past shutdowns are any guide, those workers will ultimately be compensated. Since it isnít fair to punish working-class federal employees for someone elseís political gamesmanship, lawmakers have typically passed legislation paying furloughed workers for the time they were off the job after the fact.That means the government ultimately ends up paying for work that Congress and the White House didnít allow to get done. During the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal workers were furloughed for a combined 6.6 million workdays, according to the White Houseís Office of Management and Budget. They were retroactively paid an estimated $2 billion.The Government Accountability Office took a close look at the costs of that shutdown, digging into the hard choices individual agencies had to make. In one example, employees who work on clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health were furloughed. That led the agency to stop updating its clinical trials registry, which it said provides ìcritically important information to patients,î and to eliminate services like library checkouts and pet therapy.Registry updates resumed mid-shutdown <U+2015> after members of Congress complained about it.Merely having to prepare for these scenarios comes at a cost. In the runup to a shutdown, agency officials have to spend their time getting ready to furlough workers and figuring out what programs can better afford to go on hiatus than others. All of that means time and energy are diverted from the agencyís basic mission. It is a sunk cost, whether or not a shutdown even happens.Any shutdown can affect the broader economy, as opposed to just the inner workings of federal agencies. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the 2013 shutdown of a little more than two weeks directly reduced GDP for the fourth quarter of that year by 0.3 percentage points. The bureau attributed that to the lost productivity of federal workers who were furloughed.†But some other costs are harder to estimate. Officials interviewed by the GAO said the continued threat of shutdowns tends to hurt employee morale, which makes plenty of sense. Imagine how much work you would get done this week if your boss said the entire office may shut down indefinitely starting Friday evening.HuffPost readers: Will a shutdown affect your job with the federal government?

The California congresswoman is known to be a†masterful negotiator, and she was in her full glory at an Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Vice President Mike Pence.At the outset, she set Trump back on his heels by naming the possible government shutdown ìthe Trump shutdown,î and sending him into a kind of tailspin. (ìDid you say Trump?î he asked incredulously.)Trump tried every sexist tactic in the book in an attempt to diminish the 78-year-old†Pelosi: He repeatedly interrupted her, tried to mansplain to Pelosi <U+2015> who is the former, and likely future, speaker of the House <U+2015> how Congress works, and even talked about her in the third person as if she werenít there.None of it went well for him. It was a clear win for one of the most powerful women in politics, and a lesson in how to win a negotiation with a guy who underestimates women.Read this remarkable exchange, via a transcript from The†Washington Post:Trump:†Nancyís in a situation where itís not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that. Weíre going to have a good discussion, and weíre going to see what happens. But we have to have border security.Pelosi:†Mr. President ó Mr. President, please donít characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.She was steely calm, while Trump and Schumer traded barbs back and forth and grew agitated. Like here:Trump:†Okay, let me ask you this, just ó and weíre doing this in a very friendly manner. It doesnít help for me to take a vote in the House where I will win easily with the Republicans.Pelosi:†You will not win.And Trump sure did lose this round <U+2015> or at least thatís the†consensus. Pelosi and Schumer got him to say that if the government shuts down, itís Trumpís own fault. ìI will take the mantle of shutting down, and Iím going to shut it down for border security,î he said.Successful†negotiators†try to put their opponent on the defensive.

On Dec. 4 the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 800 points. On Dec. 7 it rallied nearly 800 points. On Monday it fell 500 points, then recovered, ending the day in positive territory.Analysts and journalists have cited trade, Trumpís China deal, Brexit uncertainty, fears of an economic slowdown,†a rudderless Fed†and much else as the causes of this volatility, which isnít confined to the stock market. Corporate bonds have been jittery for much of this autumn amid a rash of downgrades from credit rating agencies. Recently, commentators have been issuing ominous warnings about a dreaded inverted yield curve†among U.S. Treasury bonds.ìAre You Ready for the Financial Crisis of 2019?î asks one New York Times headline. Will you survive the ì$9 trillion corporate debt bombî†identified by CNBC?Everybody needs to calm down. There are legitimate reasons to worry about the course of the economy, but most of the fevered analysis pouring out of the financial press is about as valuable as a trip to your local palm reader. Stock and bond analysts might know a lot about corporate profits and competitive pressures, but they canít predict the future any better than you can. The experts donít know what a final Brexit deal will look like or how long a government shutdown might last, and they canít calculate the eventual economic ramifications of things that might never exist. They donít know what unpleasant secrets are currently being papered over in corporate balance sheets, and they canít predict which supply chains will be disrupted by wars or natural disasters or what new inventions will vault their inventors to glory. The world is an uncertain place.Uncertain but not random. Hereís what the investment world does know that is spooking markets. For years now, the Federal Reserve has been signaling that it believes things are going a little too well for American businesses, and it plans to make life a little harder for them. As a central bank, the Fedís job is to ensure both maximum employment and price stability. And while there are a lot of different ways of affecting either one, the Fed functions chiefly by managing interest rates <U+2015> the price and availability of credit. If there is too much credit in the economy, then businesses can borrow too freely, leading to asset bubbles and inflation. If there is too little credit in the economy, then businesses canít get the money they need to operate, and people canít get jobs. Top officials at the Fed generally try to hit a sweet spot where the economy is operating with the maximum number of jobs possible without increasing prices.There are a lot of problems with this economic management model. For one, the Fed doesnít really know how inflation works. For another, the Fed insists on operating with an undemocratic independence from the American political process. Itís not really clear why one agency should control interest rates without recourse to taxation and government spending decisions that affect growth, jobs and prices.But for all its oddities, this is still the way the Fed works. By raising interest rates, the Fed is intentionally putting pressure on businesses <U+2015> forcing many to lay off workers or, in some cases, shut down operations entirely. The Fed doesnít do this for fun. Its top officials believe they have to cause a little unemployment in order to keep inflation from getting out of hand, although there is very little data right now indicating that consumer prices are increasing meaningfully. Inflation has been below the Fedís target rate of 2 percent for most of the year. So we know that if the Fed achieves what it hopes to achieve with higher interest rates, then companies will go bankrupt. The firms that are most at risk are generally smaller operations and those already carrying a lot of debt, which canít draw on cash reserves to meet expenses. And there are a lot of companies carrying a lot of debt right now. There is currently more than $9.1 trillion in corporate debt outstanding <U+2015> nearly double the $4.7 trillion level in 2007. Much of this debt has been blown on some pretty irresponsible purchases, stuff like stock buybacks and mergers that did little to change a companyís business prospects but offered a quick jolt to share prices. This strain of recklessness infected some very large corporations. GE, for instance, spent $24 billion in 2016 and 2017 buying up its own stock <U+2015> even though the company is also loaded to the gills with debt. In effect, the company was borrowing money and giving it away to shareholders and executives instead of investing in new equipment or research. The result is a pretty unstable company. GEís existing bonds have been plummeting in value as investors worry about the firmís ability to pay them off. The companyís management is selling off assets to raise cash quickly <U+2015> never a good sign.Which companies eventually go bust and how many of them bite the dust depends largely on how bad the Fed thinks things need to get in order to keep inflation at bay. With the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, itís possible to throw millions of people out of work and still have an economy with an unemployment rate below what the Fed has considered normal for much of the past 30 years.But thereís a wild card in this financial deck: the banking system. Any bank holding too much souring debt could find itself in serious trouble: When companies go bankrupt, banks donít get paid. After the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government implemented a lot of reforms intended to make American banks safer, and in many ways, they are. They fund their operations with more capital and less debt than they did a decade ago and keep more of their money in safer, readily tradable assets, like Treasury bonds. But top banks are still gigantic and very opaque; itís very difficult to tell whatís going on inside them, even for bankers themselves. At Wells Fargo, for instance, top managers ìdiscoverî new forms of misconduct every few months. So itís possible that the Fed could screw up. In the process of trying to cause just a little unemployment, the central bank might push interest rates too far, forcing a major corporate debt sell-off that puts the stability of the financial system itself in jeopardy. Most economists currently think thatís unlikely. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, for instance, said Monday that corporate debt levels are ìvery highî and compared the quality of a lot of that debt to the toxic subprime mortgage securities from the housing bubble. If a recession hits, ìhigh levels of corporate leverage could prolong the downturn and lead to lots of bankruptcies,î Yellen said. But she emphasized that she doesnít expect bankruptcies at banks. Even though banks have been approving a lot of bad corporate loans, she thinks the banks themselves are protected against severe losses.But the truth is that nobody really knows. And if you believe the Fed, things will probably get worse before they get better. †Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereís how."

They thought heíd hem and haw, as he has in the past, and then reluctantly sign the omnibus spending bill thatís been working its way through Congress all year. Republicans recognize that Democrats have hardly any incentive to give Trump wall funding, and the Democrats have most of the leverage in this fight. If Trump insists on a shutdown over the wall, Democrats can wait him out, pass a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the affected agencies when they take back the House in January, and then dare the GOP-controlled Senate and Trump to object. But with Trump indicating Tuesday that he welcomes a shutdown <U+2015> and would even be happy to take the credit or blame for one <U+2015> Republicans are now reevaluating. During a meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dared Trump to put up an omnibus spending bill with the $5 billion he wants for a wall on the House floor and see if it could pass. Trump thinks it could. Pelosi is confident it wouldnít, figuring that enough conservatives would balk at the spending increases that GOP leaders would need Democratic votes <U+2015> traditionally a good bet with these end-of-year spending bills, which typically draw the opposition of about 60 Republicans.But GOP leaders are now wondering if thereís something to Trumpís plan. Could House Republicans pass an overarching spending bill <U+2015> with wall funding <U+2015> with only Republican votes?ìI think we could do it,î a senior GOP aide told HuffPost on Tuesday. ìIt would be tight but doable.î The senior aide warned that it would still be ìa suicide mission, though, because we either shut down the government or cave and pass a CR into January.î ìOr we pass an omnibus with nothing much for the wall,î the aide added.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday that he thought Republicans†could pass the spending package if it contained money for a border wall. ìModerates would be more of an issue on wall funding than the HFC,î Meadows predicted.Another Freedom Caucus conservative, Raul Labrador of Idaho, who has voted against a number of spending agreements in the past, said he thought conservatives could get onboard with a spending bill if it had wall funding and closed ìasylum loopholes.îìThatís the position the Freedom Caucus took Monday night, at least,î he said.Republicans seem to believe they could pass the spending bill on their own through a combination of Trump pressure and team spirit. It could be one final diss of Pelosi if the House GOP could come together and prove her wrong, particularly after she seemed to get the better of Trump repeatedly Tuesday. During the White House meeting <U+2015> in front of the press <U+2015> Trump said Pelosi wasnít in a position where she could speak freely about negotiations. Pelosi shot back that Trump shouldnít ìcharacterize the strength that I bring to this meeting.îAnd when Pelosi returned to Capitol Hill, she further skewered the president in a meeting with Democrats.Pelosi said the wall was ìlike a manhood thingî for the president. ìAs if manhood could ever be associated with him,î she said, according to an aide in the room.The comments have already been widely reported, and Pelosi almost seems to be goading Trump into a doomed shutdown that heís already taken the blame for. Schumer particularly got Trump to clarify that, if there was a shutdown, it would be Trumpís doing <U+2015> a political gift for Democrats.But thereís still a good chance Republicans and Democrats come to some small agreement and Congress and the president avoid a shutdown entirely.While itís an interesting thought-experiment whether Republicans could pass an omnibus spending bill with only GOP votes, that bill would still need to pass the Senate and its 60-vote threshold. Even if Republicans could peel off a few centrist Democratic votes, theyíre unlikely to get enough to muscle it through the Senate and onto the presidentís desk. And, at some point, Republicans have to face those facts. Theyíve gone down the path before of pretending they can bend Democrats to their will by shutting down the government.Trying to corral Republicans, many of whom are departing for the holidays and are already missing floor votes, to shut down the government over a wall that Trump had promised Mexico would pay for is a dangerous proposition, one that Republicans would likely lose anyway.But with Trump suddenly vowing to fight, Republicans arenít ready to roll over.According to that same aide in the room, Trump told Pelosi and Schumer that they could go two routes with this meeting: ìwith a knife or a candy.îPelosi responded, ìExactly.îDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.îìI donít think we should have a debate in front of the press on this,î Pelosi said after several minutes of arguing with Trump in the Oval Office.The president has regularly threatened to shut down the government over funding for his long-promised border wall,†his signature campaign issue. The current round of government funding is set to expire on Dec. 21.""Let's debate in private"": President Trump, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi just sparred in the Oval Office on live TV about border security and funding Trump's wall https://t.co/uiiZgARky5 pic.twitter.com/EJBynT3NkRTrump wants to veto any congressional spending bill if he doesnít get $5 billion for the wall, a demand that Democrats have rejected. Pelosi and Schumer want the president to accept a set of bipartisan proposals that would allocate about $1.3 billion toward border security measures, such as fencing.If Congress does not reach a deal, a partial government shutdown looms, which would stop funding for some government agencies. Lawmakers had already passed a temporary extension before their original Dec. 7 deadline to give themselves more negotiating time. Itís possible that they may pass another temporary extension to keep the government open until the new year.In addition to border wall funding, Trump also ranted on Tuesday about Republican electoral victories and talked over Pelosi during the meeting.Underscoring the theatrics of the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that†ìPresident Trump was grateful for the opportunity to let the press into the meeting.îOn Capitol Hill, several Republican and Democratic senators rejected Trumpís demand for a shutdown.ìI disagree with the president very much so on that issue. Government shutdowns are never valuable and should be avoided,î Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters.ìNobody wins in a government shutdown,î Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said.ìNo one should be proud of shutting down the government,î Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in response to Trumpís comments.Some Democrats on Capitol Hill couldnít help but spike the football after watching the nationally televised meeting at the White House.ìItís a total disaster for Trump,î Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said, speculating that Trump was simply throwing red meat to his political base. ìHopefully, Republicans can change his mind.îSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), meanwhile, called Trumpís performance ìa horror show.îìItís exactly the way we should not be governing,î he added.Trump elaborated on his comments at a bill signing later Tuesday, and continued to threaten a shutdown.ìIf we have to close down the country over border security, I actually like that,î he said. ìChuckís problem is that when we last closed down, that was his idea, and honestly he got killed. So rather than us debating, I will take it. If we close down the country, I will take it.îIgor Bobic contributed reporting.This story has been updated with comments from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and senators.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?
