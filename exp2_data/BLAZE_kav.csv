        Breaking: Grassley gives Kavanaugh accuser a big ultimatum, or confirmation vote is back on
    Senator Chuck Grassley indicated Friday that if the accuser of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh did not respond to an offer by 10 PM to testify before Congress that the vote would be taken on Monday. 
“We cannot continue to delay""
Christine Blasey Ford says that she attended a party where she was sexually attacked by Kavanaugh when he was in high school about 35 years ago. Kavanaugh categorically denies the claims. 
Ford and her legal representation have been negotiating with Grassley about whether she would testify against Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and under what circumstances. 
Grassley declared Friday that she had several hours to agree to testify, otherwise the vote would be held on Monday to confirm Kavanaugh. 
“I’m providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford’s attorneys don’t respond or Dr. Ford decides not to testify,"" Grassley said in the statement. ""In the event that we can come to a reasonable resolution as I’ve been seeking all week, then I will postpone the committee vote to accommodate her testimony."" 
""We cannot continue to delay,"" he added. 
""A hostage situation""
Democrats were not happy with the announcement. Rep. Mazie (Hawaii) blasted the decision via a tweet from her official social media account. 
Chairman Grassley is now threatening to hold a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination on Monday unless Dr. Blasey Ford gives in to his demands,"" she tweeted. 

""The 11 Republican men on the committee are treating this like a hostage situation,"" she added. ""They just don’t get it.""
Republicans have accused the Democrats of using the claims of sexual abuse to stall the nomination vote beyond the midterms in hopes of stopping the vote with a new Congress. 
Democrats have countered that even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, they are considering calling for a full investigation if they gain control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections. 
Here's the Fox News report on the Grassley ultimatum:

        Chuck Schumer makes a startling statement about Kavanaugh's presumption of innocence
    In a startling statement from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Tuesday, he said that President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had no presumption of innocence.
'This is to find the facts'In a news conference Tuesday, Schumer responded to a statement from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) about the presumption of innocence for Kavanaugh in the face of poorly substantiated accusations of sexual harassment.
""Leader McConnell just said that Judge Kavanaugh deserves the presumption of innocence,"" a reporter asked. ""Do you agree with that? And do you view this hearing through the prism of a legal proceeding?""
""No, it's not a legal proceeding,"" Schumer responded. ""It's a fact-finding committee, we do this with every major nominee and countless times, I think 10 times in the last year, when new information comes up, the FBI goes again and does its background check. This is standard operating procedure.""
""And the question looms why are Republicans deviating from here?"" he continued. ""This is not a criminal trial, this is not a ... this is to find the facts.""
""You have to diametrically opposed stories, and there are two issues,"" Schumer explained. ""A, which story is right, and if, if, uhm, Dr. Ford is telling the truth then Judge Kavanaugh's credibility is in great question.""
A reporter then repeated the question again.
""I agree that we, this is not, that's a criminal trial,"" he responded. ""What I believe is that we should get to the bottom and find the facts in the way that the FBI has always done.""
""There's no presumption of innocence or guilt when you have a nominee before you,"" he concluded.
Watch the video of Schumer's comments below:
Later Tuesday, Republicans scheduled a vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation on Friday morning, the day after his accuser is going to testify before Congress about her claims against the nominee.

        Liz Warren hit hard for pushing deceptively edited video of Brett Kavanaugh
    Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was criticized widely on Wednesday for propagating a deceptively edited video of a comment made by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
'Is this really what America wants'In the very short video posted to Warren's Twitter account, Kavanaugh talks about his time at Georgetown preparatory high school as he addresses the Columbia School of Law.
""But fortunately we had a good saying that we've held firm to, to this day,"" Kavanaugh says in the video, ""as the dean was reminding me before the talk, which is 'what happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.' That's been a good thing for all of us, I think.""
""I can't imagine any parent accepting this view,"" Warren adds in the tweet.
""Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court justice?"" she asks rhetorically. Warren was apparently applying what Kavanaugh said to the outcry over accusations that he sexually assaulted a girl at a party in high school. Kavanaugh has completely denied the allegations.

I can't imagine any parent accepting this view. Is this really what America wants in its next Supreme Court Justice? pic.twitter.com/WhL8YeZQ78— Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 18, 2018But while many on the left thought the comments were insensitive, the full context of the video, that Warren left out, shows Kavanaugh was merely making a meaningless joke.
""I, by coincidence, three classmates of mine at Georgetown Prep were graduates of this law school in 1990 and are really really good friends of mine,"" Kavanaugh said, and named his three friends.
""And they were good friends of mine then, and they are still good friends of mine as recently as this weekend when we were all on email together,"" he added. Then he made the joke that got a few laughs from the audience.
Here's the video of Kavanaugh's unedited comments:
'Warren is very comfortable misleading people'Gabriel Malor, attorney and contributor at The Federalist, noted that MSNBC was using the same video against Kavanaugh.
""Like MSNBC, Sen. Warren is passing around a truncated version of the Kavanaugh video, in which he makes a joke about three 'really, really good friends of mine,' in order to smear him,"" Malor tweeted. ""As we know, Warren is very comfortable misleading people. Her constituents deserve better.""
""Democrats and journalists are suggesting that Kavanaugh got up in front of strangers to implicate *by name* four classmates in misdeeds requiring a code of silence,"" Malor added in a second tweet.
""That's why the context is important,"" he concluded.
""This has zero bearing on whether Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford, and the party of underage abortion and birth control on demand suddenly becoming neopuritans is a tad pathetic,"" responded Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard.
""As if we don’t all make a variation of that joke everywhere we go,"" added Ashe Schow.

        Breaking: Republicans schedule vote for Kavanaugh confirmation - and Democrats are outraged
    Republicans have scheduled the vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation for Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. — just one day after his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Democrats are outragedSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who first forwarded the letter of accusation against Kavanaugh to the FBI, expressed outrage at the scheduling of the vote.
""For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh today, two days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story,"" Feinstein said in a statement, ""is outrageous.""
""First Republicans demanded Dr. Blasey Ford testify immediately. Now Republicans don't even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote,"" she continued. ""It's clear to me that Republicans don't want this to be a fair process.""
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) tweeted that scheduling the vote on Friday was a ""sham.""
""Republicans just announced a committee vote on Kavanaugh at 9:30 AM on Friday,"" Harris tweeted, ""less than 20 hours after Thursday’s hearing ends.""

""This means little to no chance for the American people to contact them and weigh in,"" she concluded. ""This is a sham.""
'If we aren’t ready, we won’t.'Grassley indicated from his social media account that he was merely following rules about scheduling the vote, but that it was subject to change after Ford's testimony.
""[Judiciary Committee] noticed POTENTIAL [executive meeting] for Friday. Still taking this [one] step at a time,"" he tweeted.
""After [hearing] Dr Ford & Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony- if we‘re ready to vote, we will vote,"" he added. ""If we aren’t ready, we won’t.""

""[Committee] rules normally require 3 days notice so we‘re following regular order,"" he explained.
Grassley had already denied Tuesday a demand from Feinstein that the testimony from Ford be delayed in order to pursue other allegations from a second accuser that was published in The New Yorker.

        Michael Avenatti gets scorched over his demands in Kavanaugh probe
    Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film worker Stormy Daniels, demanded that the Senate Judiciary Committee respond to claims from his client, and got a scorching denial over it. 
""We focus on credible allegations""
Avenatti has been demanding that his client's claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh be investigated, but a letter from the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) shut down his request. 

""My client Julie Swetnick is demanding an immediate FBI investigation and the opportunity to testify under oath before the Committee,"" Avenatti tweeted Thursday.  
""Why is Brett Kavanaugh and @ChuckGrassley refusing to allow this?"" he added. ""Why are they trying to muzzle women and prevent the truth from being known?""
The response came from Mike Davis, Grassley's chief counsel, and was released Tuesday. 
""We have already reviewed your client's allegations,"" said Davis. ""We focus on credible allegations."" 
""Please stop emailing me,"" the email ended simply. 
The email showed the demand that had been emailed from Avenatti. ""Stop playing games,"" reads the email ""If you are the Chief Counsel, then you need to do your job. Please respond to our requests."" 
Swetnick claimed that she had been gang raped at a party that Kavanaugh attended, and said that she saw him ""spike"" punch bowls in order to get girls secretly inebriated. But when she was interviewed on MSNBC, she appeared to walk back some of the accusations, allowing many to doubt her claims.

        Here's what a classmate of Kavanaugh told the FBI about alleged sexual harassment claims
    In a statement released Monday evening, lawyers for a classmate of Brett Kavanaugh refuted claims made by Christine Blasey Ford against the Supreme Court nominee.
Here's what he saidPatrick J. Smyth said in the statement that not only was he not at the party Ford had described, but said that he had never seen Kavanaugh act in the manner she had alleged.
""Patrick J. Smyth has fully cooperated with the FBI investigation in this matter,"" the statement read.
""He truthfully answered every question the FBI asked him and, consistent with the information he previously provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee,"" it continued, ""he indicated that he has no knowledge of the small party or gathering described by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford nor does he have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.""
Smyth had previously made a statement to the Judiciary Committee, but critics of Kavanaugh and his denials wanted the FBI to investigate in order to add the threat of perjury. His story has not changed.
'I have no knowledge of the party'""I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as 'PJ' who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post,"" Smyth said in the prior statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question,"" he continued, ""nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.""
On Monday, another accuser, Julie Swetnick, appeared to change her story in an MSNBC interview with Kate Snow. 
“There are things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement last week,” Snow said before the interview aired. 
Here's the latest in the Kavanaugh controversy:
Also on Monday, a poll indicated that nearly half of Americans believed that there was a ""politically motivated smear campaign"" targeting Kavanaugh.

        Amnesty International inexplicably jumps into the Kavanaugh debate - and gets brutal backlash
    In yet another bizarre sideshow to the debate over Brett Kavanaugh, the president's nominee to the Supreme Court, Amnesty International was berated online for trying to jump into the divisive political contest. 
""Silly season""
The London-based human rights organization tweeted that they supported the Democratic narrative in the debate over President Donald Trump's nomination. 
""BREAKING: We are issuing a rare call for a halt to a vote on President Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the #SCOTUS unless and until any information relevant to Kavanaugh’s possible involvement in human rights violations,"" they tweeted Monday. 
They added a statement from Margaret Huang, the Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. 
“Amnesty International takes no position on the appointment of particular individuals to government positions,"" she explained, ""unless they are reasonably suspected of crimes under international law and could use their appointment to the position in question to either prevent accountability for these crimes or to continue perpetration.""

The statement explained that Amnesty had concerns about Kavanaugh's involvement in the decisions made by the George W. Bush administration in relation to enhanced interrogation techniques and rendition programs. Kavanaugh served for five years under the former administration. 
Amnesty also cited the sexual harassment allegations made against Kavanaugh. 
""As sexual assault also implicates a number of human rights,"" the statement read, ""including the right to be free from gender-based discrimination and violence, we also call for a thorough vetting in regard to any allegations made against Kavanaugh to this effect, including those by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.""
""We are verging on parody"" 
The statement from Amnesty was widely ridiculed on social media, with many pointing out that the statement could undermine their credibility on other human rights issues. 
""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"" responded conservative commentator Erick Erickson. ""Today is apparently ""hand in my organization's credibility"" day on the left.""
Jonathan Kay of Quillette responded, ""whatever you think about Kavanaugh (I have no idea where the truth lies in regard to the accusations), this is sad. the next time @amnesty raises its voice about torture in prisons, its moral capital will have been frittered away on the fashionable side of a US political squabble.""
""We are verging on parody,"" said Caleb Howe of Mediaite. 
""I'm waiting to assess this until we hear from PETA and Greenpeace as to whether we should proceed,"" responded Hot Air editor Ed Morrissey sarcastically. 
""Silly season,"" responded Guy Benson of Townhall.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has indicated that they will hear testimony Thursday from one of Kavanaugh's accusers about their claims before their vote on whether to confirm him to the Supreme Court.

        Mitch McConnell slams the media and Democrats in defiant statement on Kavanaugh
    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) slammed the Democrats Monday and the mainstream media over what he said was a 'smear campaign' against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 
""A smear campaign, pure and simple""
""Democrats have already made up their mind and chosen their tactics,"" said McConnell in a speech in Congress Monday. More accusations arose over the weekend from another classmate of Kavanaugh, but her claims were vague and uncorroborated. 
""Even by the far left’s standards,"" he said, ""this shameful, shameful smear campaign has hit a new low.""
""Senate democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man's personal and professional life on the basis of decades old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,"" continued McConnell. 
""That, Mister President, is where we are,"" he added. ""This is what the so-called 'resistance' has become. A smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.
McConnell went on to accuse Democrats of a ""choreographed smear campaign that ignored Dr. Ford's request for confidentiality in order to inflict maximum damage, maximum damage at the last minute on Judge Kavanaugh and his family. 
""This is an allegation of misconduct that all four witnesses either flatly contradicts or are unable to back up,"" he said.
""I want to make it perfectly clear,"" McConnell concluded. ""This fine nominee to the Supreme Court will receive a vote, in this Senate, in the near future."" 
McConnell reiterated his comments by tweeting them on his social media account:


Here's the video of McConnell's defiant statement on the floor of Congress:

Kavanaugh also appears to be on the offensive against the accusations - an interview with him and his wife will air on Fox News Monday evening denying the ""smear campaign.""

        MSNBC anchor makes stunning admissions about interview with Kavanaugh accuser
    MSNBC anchor Kate Snow admitted that NBC News could not corroborate the claims of a woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of heinous charges, but they were going to air her interview anyway. 
""We wanna be very transparent""
Snow aired an exclusive interview with Julie Swetnick, who was represented by Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti, and made serious allegations against Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh. 
""What we wanna do here is lay out all that she said, her story, our reporting, we wanna be very transparent, because these are very serious allegations,"" Snow said. 
""Kavanaugh has called Julie Swetnick's story 'nonsense' and a 'farce.' The president today questioned her credibility and NBC News, for the record, has not been able to independently verify her claims,"" she admitted.
""There are things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement last week,"" Snow continued. 
Swetnick said in the interview that she could not be certain if Kavanaugh was present when she says she was gang raped. She also could not definitively state that she saw him and his friend ""spike"" punch bowls at parties to get girls surreptitiously inebriated. 
""We've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties with Julie Swetnick and Brett Kavanaugh,"" she added, ""and we've been asking her attorney for names. So far, we've not found anyone who remembers that.""
""She's also unclear about when she first decided to come forward,"" concluded Snow. 
Here are the comments from Snow about the interview:

Snow posted a photo of her interviewing Swetnick for MSNBC. 

""Due process is not misogynistic""
NBC anchor Megyn Kelly noted the discrepancies on her social media account. 
""Due process is not misogynistic,"" she tweeted. ""It happens to be the bedrock of our legal system."" 
""Ms. Swetnick was just on NBC changing her story dramatically from her sworn declaration,"" she added.

        Kavanaugh's friend responds to 'bizarre' gang rape allegations - here's what he said
    Mark Judge, the friend to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, released a statement denying the ""bizarre"" allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly occurred 35 years ago. 
""I would remember actions so outlandish""
Judge sent a signed letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the same committee. The letter outlined several bullet points in response to allegations from Julie Swetnick. 
""The allegations in the Swetnick affidavit are so bizarre that, even while suffering from my addiction,"" Judge said, ""I would remember actions so outlandish. I categorically deny them."" 
""I do not recall attending parties during 1981-1983 when I fondled or grabbed women in an aggressive or unwanted manner,"" he added.  
""I have never spiked punch to get anyone drunk or disoriented,"" he continued. ""Nor have I witnessed Brett Kavanaugh spike punch.""
Judge added that he had never participated in a ""gang rape"" of any woman, including Swetnick, and said he would cooperate with law enforcement investigating the allegations. 
""She is courageous, brave and honest"" 
Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for adult film worker Stormy Daniels, revealed the details of the the salacious accusations from Julie Swetnick on Wednesday. 

On Friday a deal was struck to pass Kavanaugh's confirmation through the Senate Judiciary Committee on the basis that there would be an FBI investigation into the accusations against the nominee for a period of one week. Ostensibly, this investigation would include the Swetnick allegations. 
Here's MSNBC's background video on Mark Judge:

Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz was unimpressed with the affidavit of Swetnick's accusations. 
“That affidavit is so deeply flawed and so open-ended that any good lawyer, any good defense attorney would be able to tear that apart in 30 seconds,” said Dershowitz on Fox News. 
“It’s an embarrassment to the law that anybody would file an affidavit like that filled with hearsay,"" he concluded.

        The FBI has finished its report on Brett Kavanaugh — here's what happens next
    The FBI report into the sexual assault allegation against President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court is finished, and a schedule for how lawmakers will be able to review it has been released.
Here's what happens nextThe FBI report into Judge Brett Kavanaugh will not be made public, but it will be accessible to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee beginning Thursday morning.
According to Seung Min Kim of the Washington Post, only one copy of the report is available, and senators will be able to view it in a secure room where sensitive documents are protected called a SCIF.
Republicans will be allowed to review the report and be briefed about its contents first on Thursday, for an hour beginning at 8 a.m.
Democrats will be briefed on the report for an hour starting at 9 a.m. Then more Republicans will be given the same opportunity at 10 a.m.
Democrats object, and McConnell rejectsOn Wednesday, Democrats demanded that all members of Congress be allowed to review the FBI report, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) denied the request, calling it ""unprecedented and irregular"" to the process.
""And, in all candor, I believe it would be used to further delay this nomination — a goal about which you and your Democratic colleagues have been abundantly clear and single-minded in pursuing,"" McConnell added.
Also on Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) decried the limits that were placed on the FBI investigation by the Trump administration.
""The White House confirmation that it will not allow the FBI to interview Dr. Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh or witnesses identified by Deborah Ramirez raises serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation,"" Feinstein said in a statement.

        MSNBC anchor melts down after Trump says this at ceremony swearing in Kavanaugh
    President Donald Trump angered many on the left with the apology he issued to Justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family Monday for how they were treated during his confirmation.
'A campaign of political and personal destruction'Trump made the gesture during a speech before Kavanaugh was ceremonially sworn in as a Supreme Court justice.
""I would like to begin tonight's proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude,"" the president said. ""On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure.
""Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,"" he continued.
""What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process,"" he concluded.
'This entire thing was a dry run...'Not everyone agreed with the president, and many on the left were incensed that he would make such a statement.
MSNBC anchor Chris L. Hayes was especially upset, as he saw the gesture as an ""dry run"" for how Trump might deal with the impending report from special counsel Robert Mueller.
""This is waay waay worse than I imagined and I thought it would be bad,"" he tweeted.




""I now realize this speech is happening to erase the memory of his Thursday performance so it's not the last thing in people's minds before he takes the seat on the court,"" Hayes concluded.

""Just crystallized for me how much this entire thing was a dry run for when Mueller submits his findings,"" he added cryptically.
Here's the video of Trump apologizing to Kavanaugh:
Kavanaugh's entrance into the Supreme Court is widely considered to be assuring a conservative majority for the highest court in the land for a generation.

        President Trump had a strong response to the Kavanaugh hearings — here's what he said
    President Donald Trump responded to the conclusion of the hearings for his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Thursday.
'Powerful, honest, and riveting'""Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him,"" the president tweeted from his official social media account.

""His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!""
Democrats castigated Kavanaugh after hearing from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, but the president appeared to be satisfied with Kavanaugh's passionate denials before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
'This is why I nominated him'Reports from the White House seemed to corroborate the sentiment in the social media missive from the president.
""President Trump is 'riveted' and telling people, 'This is why I nominated him,' in a positive way, per person close to him,"" reported Robert Costa of the Washington Post.

""Talking to lots of people inside WH about how he likes how Kavanaugh is fighting back,"" he added. ""Admires the defiance.""
CNN's Jake Tapper reported similarly from his source at the White House.

“President Trump is very pleased with Brett Kavanaugh’s righteous indignation regarding the personal destruction of his good name and his family. He’s confident in his choice,"" said a senior White House official, according to Tapper.
Republicans have indicated that the vote to confirm Kavanaugh will continue despite claims from Democrats against Kavanaugh.

        New poll shows what Americans thought of Democrats smearing Kavanaugh, and it's stunning
    A stunning new poll asking Americans what they thought about how Brett Kavanaugh was treated in the confirmation process has a stunning result for Democrats.
Independents are unimpressedAmong the crucial election demographic of independents, Democrats are underwater by a 28-percentage point margin.
While 30 percent of independents approved of how Democrats handled the nomination, a whopping 58 percent said they disapproved.
The CNN/SSRS poll was released Monday just head of Kavanaugh being sworn in to the Supreme Court.
Independents are key indicators of elections because while those identified with either party generally vote according to their identification, independents are seen as swing votes that can decided an election.
Overall, the numbers were less rosy for Republicans. Only 41 percent of Americans said they wanted to see Kavanaugh confirmed, while 51 percent opposed the confirmation.
Other polls however, show that Democratic hopes for a ""blue wave"" are fading. On Tuesday, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that the Democratic advantage in the generic ballot had been sliced in half from 14 percentage points in September to just 7 percentage points at the start of October.
Another poll from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist released last Wednesday showed that Republicans had all but obliterated the ""enthusiasm gap"" that Democrats were enjoying.

        Lindsey Graham fires off an ominous threat to Democrats over Kavanaugh hearings
    Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) fired off a threat to Democrats over their unfair treatment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, at hearings Thursday.
'You better watch out for your nominees!'Graham was speaking to reporters about the hearings when he warned Democrats about what they might face if the treatment of Kavanaugh became the norm for nominees.
""Let me put it this way to my Republican colleagues,"" Graham said, ""if this becomes the new standard, where you have an accusation for weeks, you drop it right before the hearing, you withhold from the committee a chance to do this in a professional, timely fashion.
""When they publicly say that their goal is to delay the vote, get the Senate back in 2018, to make sure he can't fill the seat, they're publicly saying that,"" he added.
""I don't want to reward that kind of behavior,"" he explained, ""I think we've been very fair. And to my Republican colleagues, if you can ignore everything in this record, look at an allegation that is 35 years old, that is uncertain in time, place, date, and no corroboration, if that's enough for you, God help us all as Republicans because this happens to us, it never happens to them.""
""But let me tell this to my Democratic friends,"" he warned, ""if this is the new norm, you better watch out for your nominees!""
Here's the video of Graham's warning to Democrats:
'God help anybody else who gets nominated!'Graham decried the actions of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and castigated the Democrats for what he saw as a political farce during the hearings later before reporters as well.
""Here's what I'm more convinced of — the friends on the other side set it up to be just the way it is,"" Graham said. ""I feel ambushed as the majority!
""When it comes where it happened, I still don't know. I don't know when it happened, she says she's a hundred percent certain it did happen. I bet you Judge Kavanaugh will say 'I'm a hundred percent sure I didn't do it,'"" he explained. ""The people named say they don't know what Ms. Ford's talking about. She can't tell us how she got home and how she got there. And that's the facts I'm left with — a nice lady, who has come forth to tell us a hard story that is uncorroborated.""
""And this is enough! God help anybody else who gets nominated!"" he concluded.""Based on what I heard today, you could not get a search warrant or an arrest warrant, cause you don't know the location, you don't know the time, and you don't have any corroboration.""
Here's the video of Graham's comments:
Republicans have scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation Friday, much to the consternation of Democrats.

        Cory Booker admits something shocking about the accusations against Kavanaugh
    In a bizarre statement Tuesday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) appeared to state that it didn't really matter to Democrats if Judge Brett Kavanaugh were guilty or innocent.
'He used language that frankly shocked'Booker said in a statement to the media Tuesday that it didn't matter whether Kavanaugh was guilty or innocent because he has shown himself to not be worthy of the ""sacred institution"" of the Supreme Court.
""So my hope that beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on,"" Booker said, ""beyond the accusations, we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and ultimately ask ourselves the question is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment.""
""When their credibility has been challenged by intimates, people who knew the candidate well as a classmate,"" he continued. ""When his temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment where he used language that frankly shocked a lot of us.""
Booker referred to the statement Kavanaugh made in defense of his character where he said that the false allegations were revenge for his role in the Ken Starr probe that led to former President Bill Clinton's impeachment.

'Not whether he’s innocent or guilty...'""And then ultimately not whether he's innocent or guilty,"" Booker asserted, ""this is not a trial, but ultimately have enough questions been raised that we should not move on to another candidate, in that long list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, move on to another candidate.""
""Because ultimately the Supreme Court is not an entitlement,"" Booker continued, ""just because he went to Yale, or the president of your class, doesn't entitle you to the Supreme Court.""
""This is a sacred institution and the people who should be on it and whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all, the people who should be on the Supreme Court should preserve the integrity of the court,"" he concluded.
Here's the video of Booker's admission:
Republicans have charged that Democrats have tried to ""move the goalposts"" in their accusations against Kavanaugh, from trying to prove sexual harassment, to alleging that he committed perjury about how much he drank in college. Booker's statement supports the latter argument against Kavanaugh.

        A notorious Obama admin figure might challenge Susan Collins over Kavanaugh
    After a stunning announcement from Senator Susan Collins (R-Mass.) Friday that she would vote in favor of confirming Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a notorious figure from the Obama administration hinted that she might challenge her senate seat. 
Former State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki in the Obama administration asked for volunteers to challenge Collins for announcing her vote for Kavanaugh. 
""[W]ho wants to run for Senate in Maine?"" Psaki tweeted, ""there will be an army of supporters with you.""

""Me,"" was the simple response from Susan Rice, the former national security advisor in the Obama administration. 
Rice was embroiled in the scandal around the accusation from President Donald Trump that the Obama administration had ""wire tapped"" him during the 2016 election campaign. 
Rice denied any involvement in politically motivated government surveillance of Trump campaign figures, but later admitted that there had been incidental collection of information from Trump aides. She claimed that the occurrences of collection happened in the regular course of surveilling other targets.  
She was also highly criticized by many on the right for pushing the narrative that a 2012 terror attack on a U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, was inspired by an offensive YouTube video. 
After many jumped on the one word tweet, Rice said she wasn't making any announcements yet. 
""Many thanks for the encourgement,"" she tweeted. ""I’m not making any announcements."" 
""Like so many Americans, I am deeply disappointed in Senator Collins’ vote for Kavanaugh. Maine and America deserve better,"" she concluded.

        Alan Dershowitz says Kavanaugh accuser had the upper hand - but here's how she lost it
    Famed libertarian legal expert Alan Dershowitz sized up the personal credibility of  Christine Blasey Ford at the hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.
'He made this remarkable comeback'Dershowitz was speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News Thursday about the highly publicized hearings for Kavanaugh.
""When I watched her, I really thought she was extremely credible,"" he said of Ford, ""and I had grave doubts as to whether he could win the credibility contest.
""But then he made this remarkable comeback and he testified in a completely compelling manner,"" he explained.
""So I think in the end there is a tie when it comes to personal credibility,"" he continued. ""So how do you break the tie? I think one way is to look for corroboration and he has much more corroboration on his side.""
""Now the best way to make sure that corroboration is accurate is for the committee to call the other witnesses and let the FBI continue its background check,"" he said.
""And I think in the end it will do him more good than harm,"" he concluded.
Dershowitz went on to decry the efforts of the female prosecutor who Republicans chose to question Ford during the hearing, saying that she was ""incompetent"" and didn't seem to go anywhere with her questions.
Watch Dershowitz's comments on the hearing below:
Republicans have indicated that their committee vote will continue on schedule, despite Democratic demands it be postponed for further investigation.

        Judiciary Committee asks for FBI probe into Kavanaugh - and Trump has just responded
    President Donald Trump released a statement about the agreement between members of the Senate Judiciary Committee asking for a weeklong FBI investigation into the sexual harassment accusations against his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
""I've ordered the FBI...""
The White House released a statement Friday evening approving of the FBI investigation.
""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh’s file,"" read the statement.
""As the Senate has requested,"" he added, ""this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.”
The deal was made after Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he was concerned about the rapidity of the process to confirm Kavanaugh, and asked that an FBI investigation be completed within a week.
As a result of this concession, the vote continued and passed narrowly along partisan lines, 11 to 10. The decision now goes to the Senate floor for a full vote on confirmation of Kavanaugh.
""This country is being ripped apart here,"" said Flake.
""We've got to make sure that we do due diligence,"" he added. ""I think this committee has done a good job but I do think that we can have a short pause and make sure that the FBI can investigate.""
""Limited in time and scope""
Senator Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) who vociferously excoriated Democrats and the media over their treatment of the nominee, accepted the terms of the agreement.
""I respect my colleagues who have requested the supplemental FBI investigation, which will be limited in time and scope,"" Graham said in a statement. ""It can be done quickly and then we will be able to move forward to an up-or-down vote.""
“I’ve never felt better about the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh than I do right now,"" he concluded.
Here's the Fox News report on the president's statement:

Thursday saw a heated partisan environment surrounding the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment, but had very little corroborating evidence to her story. Kavanaugh also testified in his defense, and vehemently denied all of the allegations made against him.

        Here's how many Americans say Kavanaugh is the target of a political 'smear campaign
    A new poll shows how many Americans believe the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, and how many think he's being targeted by a ""politically motivated smear campaign.""
Kavanaugh vs. FordIn the poll from Quinnipiac University released Monday, nearly half of Americans surveyed (49 percent) believed that Kavanaugh was the target ""of a politically motivated smear campaign.""
However, more Americans believed the allegations from Christine Blasey Ford than the number of Americans who believed the denials from Kavanaugh.
Forty-eight percent of Americans believe Ford, while 41 percent of Americans believe Kavanaugh. Similarly, 48 percent of Americans believe Kavanaugh should not be confirmed, while 41 percent believe he should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh appeared to be heading toward confirmation after he gave a passionate defense of his character before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but one Republican, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) asked that the committee agree to a weeklong FBI investigation in order to move forward.
Republicans have indicated that there will be a vote this week to confirm Kavanaugh.

        Kavanaugh accuser's classmate deletes social media accounts, walks back claims that it 'did happen
    A former classmate of Christine Blasey Ford deleted her social media accounts after a long-winded Facebook post on Wednesday that claimed she was certain that the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ""did happen.""
“Christine Blasey Ford was a year or so behind me, I remember her,” wrote Cristina King Miranda wrote Wednesday morning on Facebook. ""This incident did happen.""
She wrote on Twitter that ""Kavanaugh should stop lying, own up to it and apologize.""
Hours later, Miranda walked back her claims in an interview with NPR.
""That it happened or not, I have no idea,"" Miranda told NPR on Wednesday. ""I can't say that it did or didn't.""
 Cristina King Miranda wrote on Twitter that Brett Kavanaugh should stop lying and apologize to his sexual assault accuser. (Image source: Video screenshot)
 
Kavanaugh has adamantly denied the accusations, as has his friend Mark Judge, who was named as a witness in Ford's letter about her allegations to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
What's the background?Ford, 51, wrote the letter to Feinstein in July but it wasn't until last week that Feinstein made the letter known.
Ford alleged that Kavanaugh attacked her at a house party in 1982 when she was 15 and he was 17.
Ford said she doesn't recall how she got to the party or how she got home, but she said she remembers that Kavanaugh groped her on a bed and tried to remove her clothes.
The letter went to say that Kavanaugh, who was allegedly drunk at the time, placed his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream and that she was afraid he might inadvertently kill her.
Ford said the incident ended when Judge jumped on the bed and they all tumbled off.
She has not accepted Sen. Chuck Grassley's invitation to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee but has insisted that the FBI investigate her accusations.
What did Miranda's social media post say?In Miranda's original post, which was shared on Twitter in a screenshot, King wrote that she attended the same high school as Blasey Ford and that she knew both Kavanaugh and Judge.
""Christina Blasey Ford was about a year or so behind me, I remember her. This incident did happen. Many of us heard about it in school and Christine's recollection should be more than enough for us to truly, deeply know that the accusation is true,"" she wrote. ""We are all in some way from that time, at least me, Christine, and I applaud her and her dignity. The drinking ensconced in the puritanism and hypocrisy of that elite, privileged, mostly white, Catholic, Washington society, was completely out of control.""
She went on to say that she remembered hosting parties at her home in which she had to call the police.
""We were teenagers and did really stupid. abusive, dangerous things. Nobody here has the moral authority over anyone else no matter what elite school or college or brilliant career and beautiful family he or she may now have,"" she continued.
""If Kavanaugh truly has the integrity mentioned by those who support him, then he should be just as courageous as Christine and stop trying to dodge the accusations, admit his actions from so long ago, speak from the heart, and apologize.""

Why did she delete her social media accounts?Miranda deleted her post that backed Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh and followed it with another post that said she was ""dealing with a slew of requests for interviews"" from several news outlets.
""Hi all, deleted this because it served its purpose and I am now dealing with a slew of requests for interviews from The Wash Post, CNN, CBS News. Organizing how I want to proceed. Was not ready for that, not sure I am interested in pursuing. Thanks for reading,"" she wrote.

Thursday morning, Miranda wrote on Twitter that she would not accept any other interviews from the media.
""To all media, I will not be doing anymore interviews. No more circus. To clarify my post: I do not have first hand knowledge of the incident that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford mentions, and I stand by my support for Christine. That's it. I don't have more to say on the subject,"" Miranda wrote.

Shortly after the last post, she deactivated her social media accounts.

        Liz Warren slams Kavanaugh over sex abuse - but has a past with contradictory allegations
    Senator Elizabeth Warrem (D-Mass.) has been a vocal critic of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over the sexual harassment allegations made against him, but she has her own past with contradictory accusations. 
""Please don’t do this”
As reported in the Boston Globe, Warren had given conflicting accounts of an alleged incident involving sexual harassment during her time as a professor. 
Warren gave a harrowing account of the sexual harassment on MSNBC, but had painted the incident in a much more light-hearted manner previous to her becoming a senator. 
""I was a baby law professor and so excited to have my first real teaching job,"" she said on MSNBC. ""And there was this senior faculty member who, you know, would tell dirty jokes and make comments about my appearance.""
""And one day he asked me if I would stop by his office,"" she continued, ""which I didn’t think much about. And I did. And he slammed the door and lunged for me. It was like a bad cartoon. He’s chasing me around the desk, trying to get his hands on me.""
""And I kept saying, 'You don’t want to do this. You don’t want to do this. I have little children at home. Please don’t do this.' And trying to talk calmly,"" she added. ""And at the same time, what was flickering through my brain is, 'If he gets hold of me, I’m going to punch him right in the face.'”
The Boston Globe details that Warren gave a much different ""light-hearted"" account of the alleged incident. 
The Globe also pointed out that she did not say in the MSNBC clip that Smith was suffering from polio, which would affect his ability to chase her. 
""He didn’t have power over me anymore""
When confronted with the contradictory statements, Warren waved it off dismissively. 
“It was 20 years later, and he didn’t have power over me anymore,” she explained. She would not say if she had said that she was laughing as he chased her when she told the story at his funeral. “I made it clear that I was just fine,"" she said. 
Kavanaugh is being accused by various women of sexual harassment with various degrees of corroboration, some with very little. He has denied all accusations. 
Warren criticized him and demanded that the president rescind his nomination. 

""The idea that the Senate would continue this confirmation process without an FBI investigation is even more revolting,"" she tweeted. ""[President Donald Trump] must withdraw Brett Kavanaugh's nomination.""
Here's the video of Warren giving the #MeToo account of the harassment:

        Sen. Feinstein did something stunning to the Kavanaugh accuser at the end of her hearing
    Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) appeared to betray her star witness against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the president's Supreme Court nominee, at the end of the hearings for his confirmation Thursday.
Here's what happened""The controversy over sexual harassment allegations arose when Feinstein revealed that she had knowledge of these claims days before the Judiciary Committee was set to vote on the confirmation.
But as the hearings came to a close Thursday and it became clear that Kavanaugh was to escape unscathed, Feinstein made a stunning claim that many saw as throwing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford under the bus.
Feinstein responded to a extended set of accusations from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) about the leaked report.
""We also know that the Democrats on this committee engaged in a profoundly unfair process,"" Cruz said.
""The ranking member had these allegations on July 30th and for 60 days,"" he explained, ""that was 60 days ago, the ranking member did not refer it to the FBI for investigation, the ranking member did not refer it to the full committee for an investigation.""
""This committee could have investigated those claims in a confidential way that respected Dr. Ford's privacy,"" he added.
""Dr. Ford told this committee that the only people to whom she gave her letter, were her attorneys, the ranking member, and her member of Congress,"" he continued. ""And she stated that she and her attorneys did not release the letter, which means the only people who could have released the letter were either the ranking member and her staff, or the Democratic member of Congress, because Dr. Ford told this committee those are the only people who had it.""
""That is not a fair process!"" Cruz concluded.
Here's the video of Cruz's castigations:
'Well somebody leaked it if wasn't you'Feinstein asked that she be allowed to respond to Cruz's accusations.
""Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I did not leak her story, she asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked,"" Feinstein protested.
""She apparently was stalked by the press, felt that what happened, she was forced to come forward, and her greatest fear was realized,"" she continued. ""She's been harassed, she's had death threats, and she's had to flee her home.
""I was given some information by a woman who was very much afraid,"" Feinstein continued, ""who asked that it be held confidential, and I held it confidential until she decided that she would come forward.""
When asked directly if her staff leaked the letter, Feinstein questioned her staff and denied it vehemently.
""The answer is no,"" Feinstein said. ""The staff, they did not.""
""Well somebody leaked it if wasn't you,"" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.
""I did not, I was asked to keep it confidential, and I'm criticized for that too!"" she responded.
""It's my understanding that her story was leaked before the letter became public,"" Feinstein said, ""and she testified that she had spoken to her friends about it and it's most likely that that's how the story leaked, and she had been asked by press.
""But it did not leak from us,"" she said. ""I assure you of that.""
Here's the video of Feinstein blaming the witness:
Republicans have scheduled a committee vote on the confirmation for Friday, much to the consternation of Democrats who demanded that it be postponed in order that other allegations be investigated.

        White House pushes back against Democrats, denies directing FBI probe into claims against Kavanaugh
    The White House denied it's directing the supplemental FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid Democratic concerns to the contrary, Bloomberg News reported.
President Donald Trump released a statement Friday evening approving the FBI investigation at the request of Senate Republicans, although he noted the probe ""must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.”

But an individual familiar with the proceedings said the White House will dictate the manner in which the FBI investigation is limited, Bloomberg News said, adding that apparently means not looking into sexual misconduct claims from Julie Swetnick, who reportedly has a long history of legal disputes and faced sexual misconduct allegations against her.
The individual also said the FBI initially was ordered to interview only four people, the outlet reported: Mark Judge and PJ Smyth (Kavanaugh’s high school friends), Leland Keyser (a high school friend of Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to come forward with sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh), and Deborah Ramirez, who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale University party.
The FBI has flexibility in regard to the subjects it may ask about, including Kavanaugh’s alcohol use, the unnamed individual told Bloomberg News. After the White House receives the bureau's findings, it will determine if the FBI should speak further to the four subjects, the outlet said, adding that it's unclear if the FBI would have to get the White House's approval to interview others.
Republican Sens. Jeff Flake (Arizona), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Susan Collins (Maine) on Friday sided with Democrats and sought the supplemental FBI investigation. At least two of them must approve Kavanaugh in a vote by the Senate, which the GOP controls 51-49.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) — who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and faces a possible investigation over her office’s handling of Ford's allegation letter — on Sunday asked the White House and the FBI to reveal specifics about what the bureau has been asked to cover in its supplemental probe, the outlet added.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told CNN she’s concerned the White House will micromanage the investigation, Bloomberg News said, and noted on CBS’s “Face the Nation"" that questions about Kavanaugh’s drinking are relevant and shouldn't be off limits, which some reports have indicated.
Trump 'respects the independence of the FBI'But senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway on Sunday denied the White House is controlling the FBI investigation, the outlet added, and told CNN’s “State of the Union"" that ""the president very much respects the independence of the FBI.”
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed Conway's assessment on “Fox News Sunday,"" Bloomberg News noted.
What about the drinking allegations?Charles Ludington, a former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, came forward Sunday in a statement saying he's ""deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale. When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive,"" the outlet reported.
Ludington added that Kavanaugh once threw a beer into a man’s face and started a fight, Bloomberg News said.
“In denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking, and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking, Brett has not told the truth,” Ludington, an associate professor of history at North Carolina State University, also said, the outlet reported.

        Morning Joe' guest blasts Kavanaugh testimony as the 'ultimate display of white entitlement
    Commentator Donny Deutsch, a frequent guest on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" on Monday told co-host Joe Scarborough that embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's fiery testimony Thursday in the face of sexual assault allegations against him was the ""ultimate display of white entitlement.""
""That Kavanaugh performance, that as a man, I was embarrassed for him,"" Deutsch added.
He also said this Supreme Court nomination has become ""about how women feel"" and that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, many American women won't be able to look at the high court ""the same way"" again.
<U+FEFF>
Deutsch also employed a curious ""income curve"" observation as part of his argument.
""As I talked to men over the weekend, I find that the higher you go on the income curve, the more men are like, 'Why, you know, well, we all did this, we all did this in one form or another' — still not getting it,"" Deutsch added. ""Women are getting it. And I find the lower you go on the income curve, men are getting it.""

        Attorney for second Kavanaugh accuser can't deny a major problem with her claim
    The attorney for Deborah Ramirez, the second sexual harassment accuser against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, could not deny a major problem with her claims in a CNN interview on Tuesday.
'She wasn't sure if Kavanaugh was involved....'CNN host Anderson Cooper pressed John Clune, Ramirez's attorney, on the report that his client was not sure that the person who sexually harassed her had been Kavanaugh, and that she only confirmed it after several days of conferring with legal counsel.
""Some people have implied that perhaps the attorney she spoke to may have politically motivated or politically connected, and encouraged her to specifically cite Judge Kavanaugh even though her memory was not full on that,"" Cooper said.
""Last night on Fox News, Judge Kavanaugh cited a New York Times report that said Ms. Ramirez had recently contacted former Yale classmates, told them or told some of them that she wasn't sure it was Kavanaugh, is that true that she had done that?"" he asked.
""You know I wasn't representing her at the time that was going on so I wouldn't be able to answer that question,"" Clune responded.
Clune went on to defend the attorney that Ramirez had contacted, and said that he didn't have any political agenda in his dealings with Ramirez.
""And just so I'm clear,"" Cooper asked, ""you're saying you have not asked your client whether in fact the New York Times reporting was correct that she called up former Yale classmates, and to some express that she wasn't sure if Kavanaugh was involved?""
""I haven't asked her about the information in the New York Times, um, article, no,"" Clune replied.
""If that in fact was true..."" Cooper said.
""Yeah, yeah, I mean,"" Clune interrupted, ""if that's true, it would be more evidence to the fact that she wanted to be very very deliberate about what was being put forth.""
Here's the video of Clune's comments on CNN:
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) denied Tuesday a demand from Democrats that the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford be delayed in order that the accusations from Ramirez be investigated.
Democrats were later outraged that a vote on Kavanaugh was scheduled for Friday, the day after the testimony is to take place.

        The View' blasts 'angry drunk' Kavanaugh, wonders if he's 'too much of a frat boy' to sit on SCOTUS
    The women of ""The View"" tore into Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Republican senators Friday, blasting the often angry testimony the Supreme Court nominee gave on Thursday in the wake of Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations against him.
'Angry drunk'""When he was angry like that,"" co-host Joy Behar said, ""one of the people who knew him as a young man said that he was an angry drunk. And that's all I could think about when he was acting like that, that that must have been how he was when he was an angry drunk.""
Co-host Abby Huntsman jumped on the bandwagon, noting that with ""the temperament that we saw with him yesterday, I couldn't help but wonder, if that was a woman up there, what the response would’ve been.""
That was all co-host Whoopi Goldberg needed to hear: ""They would call her hysterical!""
'She was telling the truth'Co-host Sunny Hostin added that Ford ""was 100 percent — 150 percent — credible. She was telling the truth, in my view. When [Kavanaugh] came up, I did not find him as credible. I think that credibility, candor, character, and impartiality are the most important qualities for a Supreme Court justice, and he doesn't have those.”
Behar and other co-hosts — in line with Democrats on Capitol Hill — also demanded an FBI investigation.
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
'Only interested in retaining white power'Apparently wanting to cover all the sociopolitical bases, Behar somehow found a way to inject race into the argument, saying Republicans are ""only interested in retaining white power.""
""They know that this country is getting darker,"" she said. ""White Europeans are now 61 percent of the population — 61 percent are white Caucasians. In 2045, it will be 49 percent, so it's going down ... it's almost like they're worried that white people are going to lose all their power, so they don't care if she's lying, or she's not lying, or he’s lying. They just want to hold on to their power.""
Behar then warned the U.S. soon would mirror apartheid South Africa.
<U+FEFF>
'Too much of a frat boy'Not to be outdone, Goldberg added more Democratic talking points, echoing her favorite senators' insistence that Kavanaugh was simply going through a “job interview.”
“This wasn't about putting you in jail,"" Goldberg continued. ""This was to determine whether you're too much of a frat boy still to sit on the court. This wasn't about taking you to jail. This was a job interview that we all have to have!”
Huntsman attempted at one point to argue that the proceedings were a sham and partisanship was evident on both sides of the political aisle, but Behar said the problem was all Republicans' fault.

        Flake says tone of Kavanaugh's testimony to senators was 'sharp and partisan'—and 'that concerns me\
    Republican Sen. Jeff Flake on Tuesday characterized the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to U.S. senators last week as ""sharp and partisan.""
The Arizona lawmaker's words were reported early on by The Atlantic, which then quoted Flake as saying, “We can’t have that on the court"" and added that the senator didn't explain what he meant.
Flake was speaking at the time with Jeffrey Rosen, president of the Constitution Center, and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) at The Atlantic Festival in Washington, D.C.

Elaina Plott, who wrote The Atlantic piece, said she asked Flake later about his comments. Here's how she put it:
The broader contextFlake prefaced his aforementioned statements by discussing the Supreme Court in general and expressing his desire that it remain an objective, nonpartisan body. He then specifically addressed Kavanaugh's testimony last Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he sexually assaulted her over 35 years ago when they were teenagers.
Flake noted that he hoped he would sound as ""indignant"" as Kavanaugh if he were ever ""unjustly maligned."" He then added, referring to Kavanaugh's tone, ""But then it went on, and the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan, and that concerns me."" But Flake added that he wanted to give Kavanaugh ""a little leeway because of what he's been through.""
""But, on the other hand, we can't have this on the court,"" Flake continued. ""We simply can't. And talk of impeachment or stacking the court — it's going the wrong direction. And this dysfunction has many fathers. ... The truth is both parties have engaged in it and have made the situation worse.”
Here's a clip of Flake's comments. The relevant portion starts at about the 1:20 mark:

It should be noted that The Atlantic story as of Tuesday afternoon quoted Flake as saying ""we can't have that on the court"" as opposed to ""this.""
What did Flake's office have to say?Flake press secretary Elizabeth Jones on Tuesday confirmed to TheBlaze that “Sen. Flake was referring to political tribalism when he said that ‘we can’t have this.’”
Flake ended up in the center of the Kavanaugh controversy Friday when he requested a postponement of the full Senate vote on the judge's confirmation until after the FBI conducts a one-week investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.
That was the same day a woman who said she was a sexual assault survivor confronted Flake on an elevator as cameras rolled: “You’re telling all women that they don’t matter. Look at me when I’m talking to you! You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter.”
UltraViolet, a women’s activist group, claimed in a news release that Flake was “potentially pressing charges” against the women who confronted him, which the organization claimed are UltraViolet members. The claim turned out to false.

    CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin made it very clear that if the accuser of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh didn't testify in front of Congress on Monday, Kavanaugh will absolutely be confirmed.
'It's just a factual thing.'""Both sides seem to be clearly digging in their heels here,"" CNN's Anderson Cooper said to Toobin.
""That's true and I think there's a factual matter that is worth putting out on the table,"" Toobin responded.
""If she refuses to testify on Monday,"" he said forcefully, ""Kavanaugh is getting confirmed.""
""[Sen.] Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has said that, [Sen.] Susan Collins (R-Me.) has said that,"" he explained. ""If she maintains, you know, that this investigation is a sham and I'm not taking part, he is getting confirmed.""
""Now that may be unfair, a good or a bad thing,"" he concluded, ""I think it's just a factual thing.""
Toobin was referring to the two most moderate Republican votes in the Senate that Democrats were hoping to persuade against the Kavanaugh nomination. Because Republicans have a majority in the Senate, Democrats have no chance to defeat Kavanaugh without some Republicans flipping.
What if she does testify?""If she does testify then I think all the cards are thrown up in the air. He may well be confirmed anyway. But I think everybody should be clear what the stakes are of her decision to come forward or not before the committee, it's up or down.""
Here's the segment with Toobin's comments:
The Kavanaugh nomination seemed to be heading toward confirmation before Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) disclosed that she had passed a letter to the FBI to investigate the claims from a former high school classmate of Kavanaugh accusing him of a sexual assault attack in the early 1980s.
Christine Blasey Ford initially said she would testify and then abruptly demanded that the FBI investigate the claims before her testimony. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) indicated that if she doesn't testify that the hearings will continue without interruption.

        Classmate of Kavanaugh named in letter is speaking out about sexual abuse claim
    An eleventh hour attempt by Democrats to undermine the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hinges on a letter alleging sexual misconduct - but his classmate is speaking out about the claims.
""It's just absolutely nuts""
Mark Judge spoke to the Weekly Standard about the accusations after he says he learned that he was named in the letter through an interview with Ronan Farrow.
""It's just absolutely nuts,"" Judge said. ""I never saw Brett act that way.""
The allegations were made by an anonymous woman who claims that Kavanaugh held her down and ""attempted to force himself on her"" during a party when he was in high school at Georgetown Preparatory School, in Bethesda, Maryland. 
The letter was revealed by Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who turned over the accusations to the FBI, without revealing who the accuser was. 
Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations. 
“I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,"" he said in a statement. ""I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""
“I don’t remember any of that stuff...""
Judge said that he didn't remember anything like the allegations made against Kavanaugh happening when they were classmates. 
He added that while he remembered ""rough-housing"" happening with other males, it did not happen with girls, in his memory. 
""I can't. I can recall a lot of rough-housing with guys. It was an all-boys school, we would rough-house with each other,"" he said to the Weekly Standard. 
""I don't remember any of that stuff going on with girls,"" Judge concluded. 
Here's the Fox News report on the accusations:

65 women who have known Kavanaugh for several decades signed a letter vouching for his good character in a letter to the Judiciary Committee. 
“We are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983. For the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect,” the letter said. 
“We strongly believe it is important to convey this information to the Committee at this time,"" it concluded.

        Chuck Grassley: Kavanaugh accuser has not yet agreed to testify
    Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Monday called for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, professor Christine Blasey Ford, to appear before his committee next week.
But the senator said Tuesday that he has been unable to get in contact with Ford and that she has yet to agree to testify before the committee.
Meanwhile, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, is demanding that the hearings be postponed until the FBI can conduct a full investigation — something the Department of Justice has already said is unlikely to ever happen.
What are the details?Feinstein has said that she wants to postpone the hearing until a full FBI investigation can be completed. However, the Department of Justice has said in regard to this topic that ""the FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation,"" so it is not clear that the FBI would have the jurisdiction to get involved.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department said:
Grassley said Tuesday that he will invite only two witnesses to the hearing to testify before the committee next Monday: Kavanaugh and his accuser Ford. However, he also said that he reached out to Ford ""three or four times"" and had not received a response.
Kavanaugh has said that he is willing to testify on this matter ""if the Senate is willing to hear him,"" according to White House spokesman Raj Shah.
What else?Sen. Mazi Hirono (D-Hawaii) has said that she thinks Ford would feel victimized if she were forced to testify without a full report from the FBI. Hirono, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, also told Politico on Tuesday that Democrats would be willing to keep the Supreme Court seat vacant for two more years in the hope that they would regain the White House.
“I think we’ve had those kinds of vacancies before, and we certainly had over a one-year vacancy with Merrick Garland,” she said. “So the world does not come to an end because we don’t fill all of the nominees.”
Feinstein demanded that other witnesses also be brought in, including potential witnesses and trauma experts. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) went a step further, asking Grassley to allow Ford's counsel to cross examine Kavanaugh.

        GOP to Manchin: Thanks for the Kavanaugh vote, but we're still coming for your seat
    Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) went out on a limb as the only Democrat to vote in favor of confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after a bitter partisan battle focused heavily on the question of whether the judge had committed sexual assault in high school.
Although his vote was welcomed by Republicans and important in securing Kavanaugh's confirmation, Manchin should not expect that he has bought himself any political free passes by siding with the GOP.
""Joe Manchin's still a Democrat and we're trying to hold the majority,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""We appreciate his vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I think it was the right thing to do. But we're trying to win seats.""
Why did Manchin vote for Kavanaugh?While it sometimes gets lost in the clear cut partisanship of Washington politics, senators, some more than others, have to balance what their party wants versus what their constituents want.
Manchin is a Democratic senator in a state that heavily voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, and that put pressure on him to support Kavanaugh to increase his chances of surviving the midterm elections. Here's how one West Virginia resident put it to the New York Times:
“Joe Manchin knows that the people of this state, we are God-fearing, pro-gun, pro-life,” said Kevin Dalton, an emergency dispatcher from the former coal town of Madison. “His constituents out here told him basically, ‘You vote this guy in or we’re going to vote you out.’ He figured he better stay in with his people.”What does it mean for him politically?Not even all Republicans believed Manchin's move was made out of courage or principle. Donald Trump Jr. attacked Manchin on Twitter after the vote:

And some Democrats who believed Manchin would take a stand for sexual assault survivors were incredibly disappointed in the senator.
Democratic state legislature candidate Danielle Walker said she cried on Manchin's shoulder as she shared the story of her sexual assault to him, and was shocked that he ended up voting to confirm Kavanaugh, telling the Associated Press ""I feel raped all over again.""
Still, most polls show Manchin leading Republican challenger Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and many Democrats in the state believe they must put the disagreement about Kavanaugh aside when they go vote.
“The progressive side will tell you, we’ve got to vote for him,” the Rev. Jim Lewis told The New York Times.

        Mitch McConnell makes a major announcement about Kavanaugh - and liberals are angry
    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a major announcement about the process to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Wednesday, and liberals responded with incensed opprobrium.
""I just filed cloture on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court,""  McConnell tweeted.

The procedural action prepares the way for a cloture vote to be taken Friday after senators review the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. A cloture vote ends debate from members of Congress about the confirmation.
""There will be plenty of time for Members to review and be briefed on this supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote,"" McConnell added.
Reports indicated that the confirmation vote will be taken Saturday.
'They drug him through the mud!'McConnell defended Kavanaugh from the Senate floor against the criticism from Democrats that he was unsuited to the Supreme Court because he had angrily defended the attacks against him before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""The same Democrats had the temerity, the temerity to say Judge Kavanaugh disqualified himself because he got a little testy at the hearing,"" McConnell said. ""A little testy at the hearing, after they drug him through the mud!
""Let's get one thing straight,"" he continued. ""I don't want to meet the man or woman who wouldn't be frustrated and angered by a coordinated strategy to destroy their good name on the altar of partisan politics.""
'Close down the Senate.'Democrats and their allies expressed outrage that McConnell was moving forward on the confirmation process despite the fact that senators had not yet read the promised FBI report on Kavanaugh.
""One copy of the FBI report,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). ""No more than an hour to review it. No ability for any follow up. Then a rushed vote.""

""For 2 years, McConnell has been carefully and purposefully breaking the Senate,"" he added. ""This is the final blow. No comity or tradition left. It’s just about power politics.
Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the Parkland massacre, urged Murphy to ""close down the Senate.""
""This is urgent,"" he tweeted. ""McConnell is complicit in the attempted destruction of our democracy.""
""Stop dealing with him and Trump as if this is just another story,"" he added. ""Close down the Senate.""
""Mitch McConnell filed a cloture vote on #BrettKavanaugh and the Senate Democrats (maybe others) HAVE NOT seen the FBI report,"" said Muslim activist Linda Sarsour. ""This is all a SHAM.""

""Mitch McConnell is the real monster of our era, the person most responsible for breaking democracy,"" responded Salon writer David Atkins.

        Catholic University suspends dean for tweet doubting Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick
    A dean at the Catholic University in Washington, D.C., has been suspended for comments that he tweeted about the validity of a woman's sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to a statement on the school's website.
William Rainford, the dean of the National Catholic School of Social Service, wrote a tweet about Julie Swetnick, who has alleged that Kavanaugh was part of a group of boys who organized gang-rapes at parties in the early '80s. Swetnick is represented by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who also represents adult film star Stormy Daniels.
""Rainford’s tweets of the past week are unacceptable. We should expect any opinion he expresses about sexual assault to be thoughtful, constructive, and reflective of the values of Catholic University, particularly in communications from the account handle @NCSSSDean,"" University president John Garvey wrote in a statement on Friday.
The tweet was posted on Wednesday, the day before Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh were scheduled to appear in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault at a house party in 1982.
What did the tweet say?Rainford has led the undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. programs at the school since 2013.
""Swetnick is 55 y/o. Kavanaugh is 52 y/o. Since when do senior girls hang with freshmen boys? If it happened when Kavanaugh was a senior, Swetnick was an adult drinking with&by her admission, having sex with underage boys. In another universe, he would be victim & she the perp!"" Rainford wrote on Twitter using the handle @NCSSSDean.
On Thursday, he issued an apology letter asking ""for forgiveness"" from the NCSSS community.
""I want to send you a message asking for forgiveness."" Rainford wrote. ""I offer no excuse. It was impulsive and thoughtless and I apologize.
""Let me assure you that I am keenly aware from decades of combined law enforcement and social work experience and education that victims who suffer assault and abuse need to be heard, respected, and provided treatment and justice,"" he continued.
""I am aware that many of you are angry, frustrated, and hurt. For this I am truly sorry,"" he said.
Rainford has since deactivated his social media accounts.
What else did the president of the university say?Garvey called Rainford's comments insensitive to the alleged victim.
""Of deepest concern to me is that they demonstrated a lack of sensitivity to the victim,"" Garvey wrote.
Rainford has been suspended for the rest of the semester.
""It is my desire that he continue to lead the school. But in light of these recent actions I have suspended him as dean for the remainder of this semester. Rainford understands and accepts this decision,"" he continued.
Garvey noted that the university has taken no position on the accusations of sexual misconduct that have been made against Kavanaugh.
""The Catholic University of America has no position on the Kavanaugh matter. But let there be no doubt that our University, and particularly our National Catholic School of Social Service, has a special concern for every victim and survivor of sexual assault.
""While it was appropriate for him to apologize and to delete his Twitter and Facebook accounts, this does not excuse the serious lack of judgment and insensitivity of his comments,"" Garvey wrote.
What else?More than 40 social work students walked out of their classes on Thursday in protest of Rainford's tweet, according to the Tower, the school's independent student newspaper.
“I don’t want him speaking for me as a social worker or as a Catholic,” Victoria Conaway, a social work graduate student, told the newspaper.
“We have a lot of professional staff here that agree with us,"" she continued. ""I think we’re at a time in the Catholic Church where we have to respond as a university.”
On Monday, more than 100 students, alumni, and faculty members held a second protest that called for Rainford's resignation.

        Trump calls sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh a 'hoax' set up by the Democrats
    President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh were a ""hoax"" set up by the Democrats.
""They're thinking about impeaching a brilliant jurist, a man that that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats using the Democrats' lawyers and now they want to impeach him,"" Trump said on the South Lawn before he boarded Air Force One to give a speech to a police group in Florida.
The remarks came after claims by some liberals that they would work to impeach Kavanaugh who was accused of sexual misconduct in the 1980s. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the uncorroborated allegations.
Kavanaugh was confirmed and officially sworn in as the 114th justice to the U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday.
President Trump claims that the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were ""all made up"" pic.twitter.com/5CNEdyloir— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 8, 2018Trump blasted the Democrats for the way they handled the allegations and for what Kavanaugh's family was put through during the process.
""And now they want to impeach him,"" Trump said. ""I think it’s an insult to the American public. The American public has seen this charade.""
He added that the Democrats' dishonesty will cost them votes in the midterms.
Last week, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, pledged to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh if the party reclaimed the majority in the House.
""I think it's going to really show you something come Nov. 6,"" Trump told reporters.
Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) was the only Democrat who voted to confirm Kavanaugh in a 50-48 vote.

        Jim Acosta makes a bizarre request at news conference - here's how Trump responded
    CNN's Jim Acosta made a bizarre request at the highly anticipated news conference Wednesday from President Donald Trump, and the president responded with a quizzical look. 
""What does he mean by that?""
The president was defending his nomination to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, at the press conference when Acosta asked his question. 
""If you mind, after I'm finished,"" Acosta said, naming several female reporters, ""one of our female colleagues could go after me.""
""What does he mean by that?"" Trump asked. ""Explain?""
“I think it would be great if a female reporter would ask you a question about this issue,"" Acosta added. 
""I wouldn't mind that at all,"" Trump responded. ""It wouldn't make any difference."" 
""Why is it, Mr. President, that you always seem to side with the accused and not the accuser?"" Acosta continued. ""You have three women here, who are all making allegations, who are all asking that their stories be head. And you know if you look at the case with Roy Moore, if you look at the case of one of your staffers, you seem to time and again side with the accused, and not with the accuser.""
""Is that because of the many allegations that you've had made against you over the years?"" he added. 
Trump responded that he wasn't happy with Moore, who had been accused of sexual harassment, but that he wanted a Republican to win and not a Democrat. He continued on to explain that even if he had picked a woman for the Supreme Court seat that allegations might be made against her as well. 
Here's the video of Acosta accosting the president:

Acosta was criticized by some on social media for grabbing the spotlight at a White House press conference, a frequent charge against the CNN journalist.

""Jim Acosta—rather than hand the microphone over to a female colleague—asks Trump if a female colleague can ask him about Kavanaugh *after* Acosta gets done talking,"" noted John McCormack of the Weekly Standard.

        Fox News contributor fired for 'reprehensible' comments about Kavanaugh's accusers
    A Fox News contributor took things a bit too far in a Twitter rant during Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.
According to Mediaite, contributor Kevin Jackson was terminated Thursday afternoon after a series of posts directed at Ford and the other two women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Even as backlash against his tweets grew, Jackson seemed to defiantly stand by what he said.
""Well luckily I work for myself. I suggest you worry about your tweets,"" Jackson replied to one of the commenters.
What did he say?Jackson appeared frustrated with Ford, feminists in general, and liberals, attacking each in his Twitter rant.
""Feminists are their own worst enemies, and enemy of women,” Jackson wrote. “Also, they want men to NEVER be believed. I’m not succumbing. TO HELL with the notion that women must be believed no matter what.“Lying skanks is what these 3 women are, and we ALL know more,” he finished.
Jackson also accused Ford of being promiscuous, although the reason for this accusation is unclear in the tweets.“#ChristineBlaseyFord academic problems came from her PROMISCUITY!” Jackson wrote. “Dang girl, stop opening your legs and OPEN A BOOK!”During her testimony, Ford said she struggled during her early time in college, at least partially due to the trauma from the alleged sexual assault.In another tweet, Jackson attacked Ford's appearance.""Wow, #ChristineFord looks rode hard and put up wet, as we say in the country,” Jackson wrote near the start of the hearing Thursday.
How did Fox News respond?The hearing was ugly enough due to the nature of the allegations and the bitter conflict between Democratic and Republican senators, and Democratic senators and Kavanaugh. Fox News was not willing to tolerate or associate with Jackson's rhetoric.
“Kevin Jackson has been terminated as a contributor,” a Fox News spokesperson told Mediaite. “His comments on today’s hearings were reprehensible and do not reflect the values of Fox News.”

        Polygraphs are notoriously unreliable, so of course Kavanaugh should take one
    The new FBI investigation into the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is mostly pointless. It seems unlikely that another week of digging will unearth the smoking gun evidence that Democrats are desperate to find. But anything besides that will never satisfy them. So, to prepare for the FBI's inconclusive results, they're finding other aspects of this circus to gripe about.
RELATED: Let's stop pretending the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh is credibleOn Monday, Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, insisted Kavanaugh should take a lie detector test. After all, Cummings said, Ford took one. Sure, the test was paid for by her lawyers and the law firm was recommended to Ford by Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office. But other than those factors, it was a totally legitimate lie detector test. Of course, there is the very small issue that lie detector tests are not even close to being 100 percent accurate.
The American Psychological Association says:
Ford is a psychologist. You'd think she might have put a little less emphasis on her polygraph test.
The question is, why stop at a lie detector test? Especially if they're known not to be 100 percent accurate. How else can we learn the truth about Kavanaugh? He says he coaches youth basketball, for instance, but has anyone given him a written test on basketball rules and strategy? If not, the Judiciary Committee should be ashamed of itself. Such a test would give us a better idea whether he has what it takes to sit on the Supreme Court.
Yes, Kavanaugh has been a federal judge for 12 years, but has anyone actually seen his elementary school report cards? How do we know he even went to elementary school?
And another thing – according to Kavanaugh's calendar from 1982, he went to see ""Rocky III"" and ""Grease II"" in the same week. But what's the deeper meaning of that? Is he a Rocky kind of guy or a Grease kind of guy? And how would that impact his opinion on Supreme Court cases?
Sure, he might have a previous Senate confirmation under his belt, hours of new testimony, and written answers to 1,300 questions, but there is so much vital information we still don't know about Kavanaugh.

        Alan Dershowitz blasts anti-Kavanaugh affidavit filed by Avenatti as 'an embarrassment to the law
    Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz called the affidavit filed by attorney Michael Avenatti as ""an embarrassment to the law.""
""That affidavit is so deeply flawed and so open-ended that any good lawyer, any good defense attorney would be able to tear that apart in 30 seconds,"" Dershowitz said during an interview on Fox News. ""It's an embarrassment to the law that anybody would file an affidavit like that filled with hearsay.""
On Wednesday, Avenatti, the attorney representing adult film star Stormy Daniels,  filed a declaration from a third woman, Jill Swetnick, who alleged sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Swetnick claimed that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge helped facilitate ""train"" rapes by spiking girls' drinks at parties in the early 1980s.
Kavanaugh has denied all of the allegations made against him. Judge has also denied the accusations. 
What did the affidavit say?In the document, Swetnick said she attended numerous house parties ""between 1981-1983 where Kavanaugh and Judge were present.""
She claimed that she witnessed them ""drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking ‘No’ for an answer.""
""This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without their consent,"" according to the documents Avenatti posted on Twitter.
Swetnick goes on to say that she ""witnessed efforts"" by Kavanaugh, Judge, and others ""to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys.""

""I have a firm recollection of boys lined up outside of rooms at many of these parties waiting for their 'turn' with a girl inside the room,"" according to the affidavit. ""These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.""
Swetnick said in 1982, she became the ""victim of one of these 'gang' or 'train' rapes"" where Kavanaugh and Judge were present.
""During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me,"" she claimed. ""I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes or something similar placed in what I was drinking.""
The accuser said she told two others after the incident. The two people were not named in the documents.
What else did Dershowitz say?Dershowitz said the affidavit was filled with hearsay and statements, such as ""I was raped, but he didn't rape me.""
Swetnick alleged that Kavanaugh was present when she was raped.
""Where was he?"" Dershowtiz asked, pointing out that the document doesn't include that information,
The document said she had witnessed the train rapes at numerous parties, but she kept attending the parties.
Are there consequences for lawyers who file a false affidavit?Dershowitz said there are many gaps in the document but he doesn't believe Avenatti would face professional consequences.
""I don't think it reaches that line,"" he said. ""I want to know who drafted it. I want to know why they didn't fill in the gaps.""

        Grassley politely shuts down Feinstein's latest attempt to stall Kavanaugh confirmation
    Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, politely rejected a demand from Democrats over new allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
'Senate Democrats hid both allegations of misconduct...'Grassley denied the demand from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in a letter released Tuesday. Feinstein asked that the testimony from Christine Blasey Ford on Thursday be delayed in order to investigate new claims of harassment.
""I respectfully decline your request,"" Grassley responded. ""I am not going to silence Dr. Ford after I promised and assured her that I would provide her a safe, comfortable, and dignified opportunity to testify.""
Grassley said it would be unfair to Ford and to Kavanaugh to delay their opportunities to give their testimonies. He also said both were facing threats and intimidation from political opponents.
""You suggest that Dr. Ford's testimony should be further delayed because of allegations made in The New Yorker by Deborah Ramirez,"" Grassley continued. ""I am unclear why Ms. Ramirez's claims should have any bearing on Dr. Ford's testimony.
“In fact, the obvious connection between these two claims is that Senate Democrats hid both allegations of misconduct from the Committee and the public,” he said.
“Indeed,” Grassley concluded, “it was reportedly Senate Democratic staff who conveyed the allegations to the media rather than alert Republican staff to conduct a bipartisan investigation.”
Grassley also shot down the request to have the FBI investigate Ramirez's claims, saying that even the ""liberal New York Times"" didn't find the claims worth publishing.
Feinstein had tweeted about the demand to postpone the testimony Saturday.
""Thursday's hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh,"" she said. ""The FBI must investigate ALL allegations.""

        Teacher tweets spelling-challenged death threat about Kavanaugh - here's what happened to her
    A Minnesota teacher is facing the music after she posted a spelling-challenged death threat about Brett Kavanaugh, newly sworn-in Supreme Court justice.
'Take one for the team'The tweet read ""So whose [sic] gonna take one for the team and take out Kavanaugh?"" and was posted from the @lookitsSammm account on Saturday.

The tweet racked up retweets from those who similarly wanted to see Kavanaugh murdered, or sympathized with her anger. But others sought out the identity of the tweeter, and discovered that she was a teacher.
The tweet was soon deleted, and the account was deactivated, but screenshots were being circulated on social media.
The teacher who posted the tweet was placed on paid administrative leave from Intermediate School District 917’s Alliance Education Center, where she worked as a special education teacher.
The Star Tribune reported that it was unclear whether law enforcement officials would be investigating the threat to Kavanaugh, who has since been sworn in as a Supreme Court justice. The teacher also didn't return calls from reporters.
The debate, centered around the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, took a rancorous turn when allegations of sexual harassment were made against him in the last week of hearings. Kavanaugh defenders charged that Democrats had waited until the last moment to reveal the charges in order to damage the nominee or postpone the confirmation until after the midterm elections.
Here's a report on Kavanaugh's ceremonial swearing in Monday:

        Michael Avenatti's secret Kavanaugh accuser reveals herself
    The formerly anonymous third Kavanaugh accuser, represented by Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti, has now come forward with her name and her story.
What did the accuser say about Kavanaugh?In a formal declaration provided by Avenatti via Twitter on Wednesday, Kavanaugh's latest accuser identified herself as Julie Swetnick, a Washington, D.C., resident. According to her testimony, Swetnick has active clearances with the U.S. Department of Treasury, the U.S. Mint, and the IRS.
Below is my correspondence to Mr. Davis of moments ago, together with a sworn declaration from my client. We demand an immediate FBI investigation into the allegations. Under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed absent a full and complete investigation. pic.twitter.com/QHbHBbbfbE— Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) September 26, 2018Swetnick alleges that she knew Kavanuagh during the 1980s and “attended well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.""
At these parties, according to Swetnick, Kavanaugh engaged in “abusive and physically aggressive behavior towards girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, 'grinding' against girls, and attempting to remove or shift girls' clothing to expose private body parts.” She also accused him of “making crude sexual comments” toward women and of being a “mean drunk.""
Swetnick disputes Kavanaugh's version of himself in high school, claiming that she witnessed him “consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s.”
The most serious claims brought by Swetnick involve Kavanaugh allegedly spiking punch at parties in order to make women less inhibited, and organizing gang rapes. Swetnick attests that she was the victim in one of these gang rapes in 1982, after being drugged by something placed in her drink. She identified Kavanaugh as being “present” at that time of her rape.
“During the incident,” Swetnick said, “I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me.”
While Swetnick alleges that Kavanaugh was present, she does not specify that he participated in the gang rape. Nor does she allege that Kavanaugh ever sexually assaulted her in any other instance. Avenatti told MSNBC that Swetnick was “100 percent absolutely” ready to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“During an interview Wednesday on ABC'S ""The View,"" Avenatti was asked to clarify what his client was alleging that Kavanaugh had done to her specifically. He declined to elaborate, instead saying that all the information was “laid out in detail in the declaration.”
Avenatti also posted a picture Swetnick, calling her “courageous, brave and honest” and asking people to respect her privacy.
Here is a picture of my client Julie Swetnick. She is courageous, brave and honest. We ask that her privacy and that of her family be respected. pic.twitter.com/auuSeHm5s0— Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) September 26, 2018What else?This identification also debunks the amusing, yet always highly unlikely theory that Avenatti had been duped by a poster on 4Chan who had posed as a Kavanaugh accuser and that he was not representing an actual woman.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/02/commentary-lets-stop-pretending-the-accusation-against-brett-kavanaugh-is-credible","
        Commentary: Let’s stop pretending the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh is credible
    The memo by Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona sex crimes prosecutor who interviewed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, last Thursday on behalf of Senate Republicans, is absolutely devastating for Senate Democrats.
In her analysis, Mitchell — who was once named as the Sexual Assault Prosecutor of the Year by Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, former President Barack Obama’s secretary of homeland security — not only argues that it’s hard to tell whether Dr. Ford’s allegations are true, she highlights major inconsistencies in her story that raise serious concerns.
Mitchell wrote, “Here is my bottom-line: A ‘he-said, she-said’ case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that.” She added, “I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee. Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-evidence standard.”
This means that in Mitchell’s professional opinion as a 25-year veteran of sex crimes prosecutions, Dr. Ford’s allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted her while they were teenagers is so unbelievable that it fails to meet even the lowest thresholds to demonstrate culpability within our legal system because they just don’t make sense. Indeed, the gaps and inconsistencies in Dr. Ford’s testimony are shady, irreconcilable, and defy logic.
For instance, the most glaring issue is that Dr. Ford provided four different dates for when she was attacked within the span of a couple of weeks:
<U+25CF> According to the Washington Post, notes from Dr. Ford’s 2013 therapy session, which she refused to turn over to Senate investigators, list the attacks as having occurred when she was in her “late teens.”<U+25CF> Dr. Ford was born in November 1966. Her “late teens” would be consistent with a July 6, 2018, text message to a Post reporter where she describes the alleged attack as happening in the mid-1980s.<U+25CF> For reasons that remain unclear, three weeks later, in a July 30th letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Dr. Ford then changed the date of the attack to the “early 1980s.”<U+25CF> One week later, Ford takes a polygraph test with her lawyers where she was asked before-hand to describe the events. In that statement, she first wrote that the alleged attack occurred in the early 1980s. But then something strange happens. As you can see, she scratched out “early 1980s” and left it as “1980s.”<U+25CF> Finally, by mid-September, in her first on-the-record interview, Ford narrowed the date of the attack to the “summer of 1982.”To recap: Presumably for decades, and certainly as of 2013 and early July, Ford claimed that her alleged attack happened in the mid-1980s when she was in her late teens. Then, after consulting with friends and lawyers, the date of the attack changed to 1982 until she homed in on the summer of that year.
Why is this important? If the attack happened when Ford was in her late teens (1984-1986), as her therapist’s notes and correspondence with the Washington Post state, Brett Kavanaugh would have been 300 miles away from her as a full-time student at Yale University. Furthermore, as Ford herself noted in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she began college at age 17 in Chapel Hill, meaning she spent much of her “late teens” in North Carolina—far away from the Maryland suburbs where she claims Kavanaugh attacked her.
There are additional contradictions in Ford’s account that undermine her case, including several changes to the number of boys who attacked her and odd memory gaps. But her timeline discrepancies may be the most damaging since the first dates she provided could exonerate Brett Kavanaugh as her assailant by severely narrowing, or even eliminating, his window of opportunity to have committed the crime.
Brett Kavanaugh appears to have been the rare breed of student who could party and play sports without missing a beat in the classroom, but he certainly did not defy the laws of physics. Unless the FBI finds groundbreaking evidence this week that supports her allegation, Dr. Ford’s testimony should be considered as simply not credible — and the Senate should proceed to ascend Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

        How do self-identifying witches process Kavanaugh anger and grief? Internet spells, of course.
    It appears that self-identifying witches are turning to pagan spells and rituals on the Internet in order to process grief, anger, and trauma over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he was accused of sexual assault in an alleged incident more than 35 years ago, Vox reported.
 U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (L) participates in a ceremonial swearing in by retired Justice Anthony Kennedy (R) in the East Room of the White House, October 8, 2018, in Washington, D.C. Kavanaugh was confirmed in the Senate 50-48 after a contentious process that included several women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Take the ""Gratitude Spell,"" for instance.
Written by Instagram user @celestight for the pagan political organization WitchtheVote — which mobilizes voters to support candidates that defend progressive and feminist causes, Vox said — participants can make sacred signs called a ""sigil"" on paper or simply write notes of thanks to Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford while holding grains of salt.
More from Vox:
Given that Kavanaugh — who denied Ford's allegations — was confirmed to the high court, the outlet said such rituals have become a form of self-care. ""These rituals of witchcraft, for some, fill a gap in the societal order by providing a structure and a vocabulary for issues that American culture more broadly has not yet satisfactorily addressed,"" Vox said.
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
'Hex Kavanaugh'For instance, there's a “Hex Kavanaugh” shindig at Catland — a Brooklyn-based pagan bookstore and supply shop — on Oct. 20, if you're in the neighborhood:
He will be the focal point, but by no means the only target, so bring your rage and and all of the axes you've got to grind. There will also be a second ritual afterward — ""The Rites of the Scorned One"" which seeks to validate, affirm, uphold and support those of us who have been wronged and who refuse to be silent any longer.'Witchcraft is particularly powerful for women'Kristen J. Sollee, author of the book ""Witches, Sluts, and Feminists,"" had a word or two for Vox on the subject.
“Witchcraft is particularly powerful for women and folks on [the] feminine spectrum right now because we need tools steeped in community, empathy, and nature to both heal ourselves and fight the abuses of capitalist, white supremacist heteropatriarchy head on,"" she told the outlet. ""Witchcraft is about conjuring strength and agency from within and not bowing down to arbitrary authority, so it’s a reminder that your oppressors, your trauma, and your government don’t have to define you — or break you. Ironically, the very practices that may have once spelled death for women centuries ago can now be life-saving.”
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
Facebook group the Magic Resistance noted to Vox that it performed a ""Bind Kavanaugh"" spell Saturday before the Senate voted to confirm the judge. Participants lit a white candle symbolizing justice and purity and placed the Justice tarot card adjacent to it on an altar before wrapping a black thread around a paper doll — symbolizing Kavanaugh — to bind him, the outlet said.
In addition, participants were encouraged to chant the names of Kavanaugh’s known accusers, binding him “in the name of” all those they believed he'd wronged, Vox said.
Michael M. Hughes — the founder of Magic Resistance and author of ""Magic for the Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change"" — told the outlet he sees Kavanaugh as the “epitome of every entitled ... guy who never faced the consequences of his actions.”
More witches than ... Presbyterians?Trinity College in Connecticut ran three large, detailed religion surveys from 1990 to 2008, Quartz reported in its article, ""The US witch population has seen an astronomical rise,"" showing Wicca grew tremendously in America over this period from about 8,000 in 1990 to about 340,000 in 2008. It also was estimated that in 2008 there were around 340,000 pagans in the U.S., the outlet said.
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
Pew Research Center in 2014 found that 0.4% of Americans — around 1 to 1.5 million people — identify as Wicca or Pagan, Quartz said. The high end of that estimate would eclipse the number of mainline Presbyterians in the U.S., according to the Christian Post.
'Wicca has effectively repackaged witchcraft for millennial consumption'""It makes sense that witchcraft and the occult would rise as society becomes increasingly postmodern,"" author Julie Roys, formerly of Moody Radio, told the Christian Post. ""The rejection of Christianity has left a void that people, as inherently spiritual beings, will seek to fill.""
She added that ""Wicca has effectively repackaged witchcraft for millennial consumption. No longer is witchcraft and paganism satanic and demonic. It's a 'pre-Christian tradition' that promotes 'free thought' and 'understanding of earth and nature.'""

        Lindsey Graham takes on Democrat Mazie Hirono in scathing critique over Kavanaugh
    Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) continued his campaign against Democratic rhetoric in the fight to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, even after he was sworn in to the highest court on Monday. 
""The Hirono standard is horrific""
Graham spoke to Sean Hannity on Fox News on Monday about the 'horrific standard' that Democrats had advocated in their failed attempt to destroy the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. 
""I think that's what Susan was understanding as that if she legitimized this process, God help the next person nominated to the Supreme Court,"" he said, referring to Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine.).
""If you legitimized this process,"" he explained, ""the rule of law gave way to mob rule.""
""The Hirono standard is horrific,"" he said, referring to comments from Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). 
""What was insulting is the way that the Senator from Hawaii took everything we hold near and dear and threw it over because she didn't Kavanaugh and didn't like Trump,"" he added.  
“You got a decision to make, America,” Graham said later in the interview. 
""Do you want to live in the world of Senator Hirono where you’re guilty until proven innocent because you’re a Republican,"" he asked, ""you don't have a presumption of innocence, or do you want to live in the Susan Collins world where you will actually be heard, listened to and evaluated?"" 
Here's the video of Graham's comments:

Senator Graham has become a favorite among the right after he voraciously defended Kavanaugh against Democratic rhetoric during his confirmation hearings. 
Graham also warned Democrats that their tactics could be used against them the next time they have a nominee to the Supreme Court. 
“But let me tell this to my Democratic friends,” he said, “if this is the new norm, you better watch out for your nominees!”

        Red-state Democrats facing tough re-election battles remain mum on Kavanaugh vote
    The red-state Democrats who may well hold the key to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court are keeping their cards close to the vest when it comes to declaring how they'll vote on the controversial nomination.
At least three Republicans — Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — have not committed to vote ""yes"" on Kavanaugh, which means that Kavanaugh may need Democratic votes to be confirmed in the closely divided Senate.
West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) is among one of several red-state Democrats whose vote may be key for Kavanaugh.
Manchin told reporters on Monday that he would wait for more information from all parties involved in the sexual misconduct accusations lobbed against Kavanaugh following the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings two weeks ago, The Washington Examiner reported.
“I want everybody to be able to tell their side of the story if it’s validated and I want him to have a chance to clear his name,"" Manchin said. ""Period, period, period, period.""
Two women, Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, have accused Kavanaugh of inappropriate sexual behavior toward them. Neither of the women's stories has been corroborated by witnesses.
Kavanaugh has adamantly denied the accusations and admitted in an interview that he was a virgin until many years after college.
Manchin is in a race against Patrick Morrisey (R) to keep his seat in a state with strong support for President Donald Trump.
Who are the key Democrats?Joe Donnelly (Ind.) is also facing a tough re-election in November, but he said he would keep an open mind until all the facts are laid out.
""I just want to hear all the facts, hear what everybody has to say,"" Donnelly told reporters on Monday, The Examiner reported.
Donnelly who's up against Republican Mike Braun went on to say that he isn't feeling pressure from either side on his vote.
""No. I'll just do what's right, no matter what,"" he said.
North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said she believes the accusations need to be ""looked into,"" but she made no further comment, according to CNN.

What about Senate Democrats who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination?Some Senate Democrats believe Kavanaugh should be disqualified over the unconfirmed allegations, claiming that the women's accusations should be proof enough.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has said she believes the accusations and that the FBI should conduct a full investigation.
""A Fox News interview is not the same as an FBI interview. If Brett Kavanaugh really wants a “fair process,” we need the FBI to conduct a full investigation to establish the facts, including interviews with corroborating witnesses,"" Gillibrand tweeted Monday night.

In an earlier tweet on Tuesday, Gillibrand said it's time for a new nominee.
""Enough is enough. One credible sexual assault claim should have been too many to get a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and make decisions that will affect millions of women’s lives for generations. Two is an embarrassment. It’s time for a new nominee."" Gillibrand tweeted.

Sen. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) said she believes the women and characterized the allegations as ""attempted rape"" in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday.
On Monday, Hirono stood alongside activists at the Capitol where she vowed support for Ford.

What do Republicans say?Many Republicans stand ready to fight back against the accusations, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-Ky.), who on Monday called the allegations a ""shameful, shameful smear campaign"" while speaking on Senate floor.
McConnell blasted Democrats and their allies for ""trying to destroy a man's personal and professional life.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina urged the party to push forward with Kavanaugh's confirmation vote.

""What we are witnessing is the total collapse of the traditional confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee. It is being replaced by a game of delay, deception, and wholesale character assassination,"" he wrote in another tweet.

What else?Ford and Kavanaugh, along with his wife, are scheduled to testify separately before the committee on Thursday.

        Chaos erupts at the Capitol after Collins assures Kavanaugh confirmation
    Protesters increased in their aggressive demonstrations on Capitol Hill after Senator Susan Collins (R-Mass.) pushed the Kavanaugh confirmation over the top Friday. 
Several instances of the aggressive tactics by angry and frustrated protesters were caught on video and shared on social media. 

Protesters drowned out Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) while he was trying to speak to reporters with chants of ""shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!"" Manchin was the only Democrat to indicate that he would vote positively to confirm Kavanaugh. 
Reporters also seemed annoyed by the intrusive demonstrators.
Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana posted video of protesters harassing him as he went to the Kavanaugh vote. One woman can be seen being dragged away by a policeman, and another shouts at him while holding a baby. 

""This is what the U.S. Capitol was like today as I walked to the Senate floor for the vote on Judge Kavanaugh,"" Kennedy tweeted. 
Many demonstrators were targeting Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who had asked for the Kavanaugh vote to be postponed in order to allow for an FBI investigation.

There was also a human wall against misogyny composed of statements by President Donald Trump. 
In front of the Capitol—barricaded in a somewhat unprecedented measure—is BrickXBrick, a group dedicated to building human walls in protest of acts of misogyny. Their outfits include quotations from President Trump that degrade women. pic.twitter.com/p252YcwDpWProtesters were also assembled and arrested from in front of the Supreme Court:

Capitol Police reported that 302 people were arrested for ""unlawfully demonstrating"" in Senate offices Thursday. On Friday they said that they arrested 101 people. 
The confirmation vote for Kavanaugh is scheduled for Saturday.

        College Republicans plan beer toast for Kavanaugh — but pub asks group to stand down. It gets testy.
    Some might argue it was just your average, friendly, quiet gathering of College Republicans from the University of Washington.
Then again, the GOP students advertised that their get-together at a Seattle bar was to hoist beers in celebration of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court following contentious hearings in which he was accused of sexual assault when he was a teenager.
 In this handout photo provided by the Supreme Court of the United States, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., administers the Constitutional Oath to Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as his wife Ashley Kavanaugh holds the Bible while joined by their daughters Margaret and Liza, in the Justices Conference Room at the Supreme Court Building on Saturday, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Fred Schilling/Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)
The event's “Beers 4 Brett” moniker is presumably a reference to Kavanaugh’s “I liked beer, I still like beer” answer to one of the Senate Judiciary Committee's questions. And part of the Facebook announcement of Saturday evening's event also called it a celebration of ""the failure of the lies and false claims against"" the judge.
So as you might expect, some progressives apparently got angry and complained to Shultzy’s Bar and Grill, KTTH-AM reported.
How did the bar respond?Shultzy posted a message of its own on Facebook to the College Republicans: “Shultzy's is a sports-themed bar & grill that welcomes everyone. We do not promote or endorse any one religious or political viewpoint. As such, due to the political nature of your planned event, we request that you find another venue to celebrate.""

What did the College Republicans do in response?“I thought that the left-wing activists who took notice of our event had lied to the restaurant about the nature of our event,” Chevy Swanson, the UW College Republicans president, told KTTH. “It seemed incredibly odd to deny service for a quiet gathering of College Republicans and guests.”
More from KTTH:
Swanson immediately contacted Bill Becker of Freedom X, the attorney who successfully sued UW on their behalf, after the school imposed onerous fees in a move to silence the group’s political activism.“[Becker] advised us to call and explain that they can’t deny service over political leanings,” Swanson told KTTH. “We did, and they hung up on us.”
So Becker posted a warning to the Shultzy’s Facebook page, the station said: If you deny service to the College Republicans, Freedom X will sue.
With that, Swanson and over a dozen fellow members of the GOP group went to Shultzy's as planned — and even told the staff flat out they were there for their advertised gathering.
“We asked for a table, and they served us,” Swanson told KTTH.
Swanson told the station that their treatment at the hands of progressives and the bar wasn't much different than how they're typically treated for being conservative, especially in a liberal city — but also they're not done standing up for their beliefs.
“It’s shown that it’s clear that the tension against conservatives around here has hit a boiling point where even the smallest public showing of support of conservative ideas is a point of contention and that there is no reason to roll over to hostility like that,” Swanson also told KTTH.
The station said Shultzy’s Bar and Grill didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.

        F*** you and your rapist husband': Kavanaugh, family receive death threats over allegations
    Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his family have received numerous nasty messages and threats since Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her more than three decades ago, CNN reported.
The allegations, which have resulted in Ford and her family having to leave their home for security reasons, have also brought heightened risk to the Kavanaugh family.
A law enforcement source told CNN that there are several active, credible threats against Kavanaugh and his family, in addition to more threats that have been investigated since his nomination.
What are people saying?Kavanaugh's wife, Ashley, has been the target of some particularly nasty messages from opponents of Kavanaugh's nomination or people who seem to believe Kavanaugh indeed sexually assaulted Ford in high school.
""Please tell your rapist, lying, cheating, corrupt b***h of a husband to put a bullet in his ugly f***ing skull,"" one email obtained by Fox News read. ""My condolences to you for being married to a rapist. Although you probably deserve it.""Another email got a bit more to the point, with the writer saying ""F*** YOU AND YOUR RAPIST HUSBAND"" according to CNN.
CNN reported that Kavanaugh and the family received many more harsh emails, some of which could not even be published or broadcast due to their explicit content.
""F*** YOU, RAPE ENABLING C***. YOUR HUSBAND IS A LIAR, THIEF, RAPIST AND PROBABLY A PEDOPHILE. BURN IN HELL YOU WORTHLESS F***ING C***,"" one of the worst obtained emails read. ""MAY YOU, YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR KIDS BURN IN HELL YOU F***ING PIECES OF TRASH. EAAAAATTTTT S**T!!!!!!!!!!""
Getting worse by the dayIn the course of one week, the nomination process has spiraled into an ugly political battle that has endangered the wellbeing and security of both the accuser Ford and Kavanaugh, as well as their families.
As of now, the Senate Judiciary Committee still plans on holding a hearing Monday at which Kavanaugh said he is willing to testify and Ford has been invited to testify, although she has said through her lawyers she is unwilling to appear publicly so quickly.
Ford said she is willing to appear before the committee later in the week, although Republicans are attempting to avoid further delays of the confirmation vote.

        Chelsea Clinton critiques Kavanaugh in CBS interview—but sexual assault allegations aren't mentioned
    Chelsea Clinton in a ""CBS This Morning"" interview criticized Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as ""nakedly partisan,"" but neither she nor the co-hosts mentioned sexual assault allegations against him, which have been the impetus for the delay in Kavanaugh's confirmation.
""We saw the president of the United States Donald Trump last night mock Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in a campaign style rally,"" Norah O'Donnell began Wednesday's interview — without noting Ford's testimony focused on sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. ""What did you make of that?""
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
""I don't think the president should be mocking anyone,"" Clinton replied, noting Trump's words weren't ""becoming"" of a president. ""I don't think he should be mocking Dr. Ford. I don't think he should be mocking a Gold Star family. I don't think he should be mocking a disabled reporter.""
Co-host Gayle King did bring up Clinton's mother and father in relation to Kavanaugh's testimony, in which the nominee pointed a finger at Democrats for ""a calculated and orchestrated political hit"" against him fueled in part by ""revenge on behalf of the Clintons,"" CBS News reported.
""Did you call your mom or your dad and say, 'Can you believe he just mentioned our name?' You all must have had a discussion about it,"" King said to Clinton. ""What was that like?""
Clinton seemed surprised by that portion of Kavanaugh's statement: ""Oh, my gosh, we loom so much larger in your mind than you loom, at least in mine,"" she recalled reacting during the interview. ""Like, I don't think I'd heard his name until he was nominated weeks ago.""
'Nakedly partisan'She added: ""But to me what was so troubling was how nakedly partisan he was. And I think the principle of a judicial review being absent of partisanship is still really important. So if he had gone after President Bush or President Reagan's family, I'd feel the same way. Like, I just don't think that that is healthy as a dynamic on the Supreme Court or, really candidly, any court.""
Again, no mention of sexual assault allegations — not even as a troubling element of the Kavanaugh controversy for Clinton, apparently.
What is troubling to Clinton with regard to Kavanaugh?Clinton told ""CBS This Morning"" that her ""opposition"" to Kavanaugh's confirmation ""is rooted in policy,"" such as workers' rights, women's rights, and the environment. ""But I now am even more kind of intense in my feelings because of how political he's become.""
So Kavanaugh's ""political"" stance is looming large in Clinton's mind — but what accusations of sexual assault? Will we ever know?
Ford's 'plight'Also part of a question to Clinton was Ford's ""plight"" after she reached out to a local politician and ""said that it was her civic duty, wanted to be anonymous, didn't want to come public the way she has now, and then we see the result. What is your response to those who say, 'You know what, I was going to do that, but I don't need to go through that.'""
Here's how CBS News described Clinton's response: ""She said she hopes the discourse surrounding Ford and Kavanaugh's showdown doesn't have 'a chilling effect' on women coming forward.""
Coming forward about what?
The latter exchange in the interview didn't mention what Ford's ""plight"" revolved around, what her ""civic duty"" was aimed at, why she wanted to remain anonymous and not ""come public"" — in short, no mention of Ford's sexual assault allegations.
The interview went on to other subjects, including a letter she wrote to President Ronald Reagan when she was 5 protesting his visit to a German military cemetery with buried SS troops, the network said.
Here's the full interview:
<U+FEFF>
This writer's perspectiveCould it be that neither ""CBS This Morning"" nor Clinton mentioned the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh during the interview because Bill Clinton was accused of the same thing? Uncomfortable subject, maybe? Asking for a friend.

        Kavanaugh supporters get screamed at, surrounded, reportedly shoved by leftist mob at major college
    Conservative students at the University of Texas at Austin got a dose of mob justice Tuesday when they set up a table and held signs in support of embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has denied accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.
Young Conservatives of Texas members held up signs that read “#MeToo Gone #TooFar,” “KavaNotGuilty,” and “No Campus Kangaroo Courts in Congress,” the College Fix said, adding that their “Change My Mind” sign called for respectful debate.
But detractors weren't so respectful.
What else happened?“We did want people to talk to us, but unfortunately it’s hard to do that when you have an angry mob ripping our signs and screaming in our faces,” student Anthony Dolcefino, vice chairman of the group, told the outlet, adding that his fellow members also were called ""rape apologists.""
Amid chants of “we believe survivors!” “f*** YCT!” and “YCT off UT!” the College Fix said Kavanaugh supporters were surrounded by furious counterprotesters, who at one point reportedly shoved a conservative student while grabbing her sign.
“At the peak we had 150 people out there recording, screaming, rioting,” Dolcefino added to the outlet. “The UTPD got involved, making sure people were not coming behind us.”
Here's a fun little excerpt. (Content warning: Language):
More from the College Fix:
One student told the conservatives if they did not want their signs ripped up they should not have written such offensive things. Another video shows a protester violently grab signs out of the conservative students’ hands and rip them up before coming around their table and getting in their faces. Dolcefino said at one point one of their members was shoved as she had her sign snatched away. Image source: Facebook video screenshot

How did it end?After two hours, campus police escorted the Kavanaugh supporters to safety, the outlet said.
“It is despicable and wrong for people to be here trying to uplift a man who is clearly a perpetrator of assault,” student and counterprotester Elizabeth Boone told the Daily Texan. “It just really shows that even on a campus like this there are people who truly do not care about women, and they don’t care about people who have been assaulted.”
Sara Kennedy, UT director of strategic and executive communications, told the paper that the school supports free speech by safe means.
“All of our students have a right to free expression and the university takes that right very seriously,"" Kennedy added to the Daily Texan. ""Our main concern is about safety and that students have the right to express themselves.""

        Kavanaugh bows out of teaching Harvard Law winter class; graduates had been lining up against him
    U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh bowed out of teaching a January class at Harvard Law School as sexual assault allegations threaten his confirmation to the high court, the Washington Post reported, citing a Monday email from the school to students.
“Today, Judge Kavanaugh indicated that he can no longer commit to teaching his course in January Term 2019, so the course will not be offered,” Catherine Claypoole of the law school curriculum committee wrote to students, the paper said.

Harvard Law School grads sign letterKavanaugh's decision came amid more than 800 Harvard Law School graduates signing a letter in less than three days calling on their alma mater to cancel Kavanaugh’s appointment as the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law and disallowing him to teach in the winter term, the Post reported.
“Now more than ever, HLS must send a clear message that it takes sexual violence seriously,” the letter to Dean John Manning said, according to the paper. “The accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, including those by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, are credible and grave. They seriously call into question his character and morality, and should disqualify him from ... any position of esteem, including lectureships at HLS.”
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations against him.
'People are coming together'Jessica Lynn Corsi, a law lecturer and 2010 Harvard Law graduate, said the letter — which hadn't been delivered to the dean as of Monday evening — matters not only because of the number of signatures on it but also due to ""the character and the work of the people that are signing on,” the Post said.
""People are coming together to say, ‘This isn’t the type of person we want teaching at Harvard Law,’” she added to the paper.
Mariel Goetz, a 2008 graduate, told the Post that Harvard Law School should take the lead on issues like this and send a message that people aren't simply entitled to the school's prestigious lectureships. She added to the paper that signature gathering will continue as the group continues working toward getting Kavanaugh's appointment rescinded.
The dean speaks outDean Manning assured students, the Post said, that ""when concerns and allegations arise about individuals in our teaching program, we take those concerns and allegations seriously, conduct necessary inquiries, complete our process, and then act.”
Harvard Law School student leaders didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday, the paper noted.

        PA-Gov: Republican Wagner 'shocked and disgusted' by 'politically immoral' Kavanaugh opponents
    Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner called for the confirmation of embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a Facebook video statement, adding that he was ""shocked and disgusted"" by the way Kavanaugh's ""politically immoral"" detractors have behaved.
""I was shocked and disgusted by the way Judge Kavanaugh and his family had been treated,"" Wagner said.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Wagner added that Kavanaugh's opponents have used ""scorched earth tactics"" in an attempt to benefit politically in the wake of sexual assault allegations brought against him on the eve of his confirmation.
Friday's minute-long clip was a response to a query by Planned Parenthood's political arm, PennLive reported.
'Enough is enough'Wagner also added President Donald Trump to his message, noting that ""it has become crystal clear to all Americans that there are those whose only wish is the destruction of a duly elected president.""
While Wagner didn't mention by name Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford — who gave testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday — he did say we ""also witnessed the agony of a woman, clearly troubled by her experience.""
Further the GOP nominee added, ""We cannot allow legitimate women's issues to be weaponized by the politically immoral."" He also called for a ""return to manners, a return to respect, and a return to the politics of decency.""
""Enough is enough,"" Wagner concluded. ""It is time to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court where he belongs.""
Here's the clip:
How did Wolf respond?Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf — who's facing Wagner in November's midterm election — said in a tweet posted to his official Twitter account Friday that ""Ford's testimony was credible. We should not confirm Judge Kavanaugh to a lifetime appointment until the FBI can investigate,"" PennLive said, adding that Wolf was replying to Planned Parenthood's request for comment.
Wolf also said he stood with Republican governors in Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vermont ""in calling on Senate Republicans to delay the vote,"" the outlet added.
What else did Wagner say?Wagner's spokesman Andrew Romeo told TheBlaze that the GOP candidate ""believes that Dr. Ford clearly experienced something terrible and he admires her courage for coming forward.""
But Wagner also ""feels there is no evidence to show Judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator of the crime that occurred. Scott would have voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh on Friday morning without an FBI investigation, but he feels the investigation will only further illustrate that there is no reason for Judge Kavanaugh not to be on the Supreme Court,"" Romeo added to TheBlaze.

Police have not yet made an arrest in relation to the incident, WTVO said in a follow-up story.
The owners of the building — which also houses several law offices — told WTVO it was the first time something of this magnitude occurred since they began ownership in 2006.

A company that specializes in graffiti removal power-washed away most of the spray-painted words, the station said.
What did elected officials have to say about the incident?“We can have our differences. We can have good spirited debate,"" Republican John Cabello of the state House of Representatives posted on his Facebook page, WREX-TV reported. ""I hope whoever is responsible for this will be brought to justice. You are a coward for doing it unless you come forward!”

GOP state Sen. Dave Syverson told WREX he views the vandalism as fallout from U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s behavior during the Kavanaugh hearings: “These are the unintended consequences when you take politics to a level that she did. Unfortunately, this probably won't be the last.”
Winnebago County Board Chairman Frank Haney released the following statement, the station said, which read in part: ""This is not who we are. I am extremely disappointed in the individual responsible for the ugliness at our local Republican HQ. Clearly, this person needs help. As a Republican, I am saddened and angry. I am also sad to see other folks in my party unfairly labeled and mischaracterized. Negative generalizations about a group of people has [sic] never served us well as a country. This situation is no different. Attacks of this nature aim to silence and destroy, neither of which will occur.”
Rockford Democratic Mayor Tom McNamara posted a statement on Facebook as well, WREX said: “This type of behavior is unacceptable and certainly does not live up to our community’s values. We all have differences, but we must learn to disagree on policy without attacking people.”

        SCOTUS Justice Brett Kavanaugh spotted serving homeless again. Some leftists claim it was staged.
    Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was seen serving food to the homeless while volunteering for Catholic Charities in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, causing left-wing critics to allege the scene was a staged public relations stunt aimed at ""humanizing"" him.
What are the details?Entertainment publication TMZ reported on Judge Kavanaugh keeping up his volunteer work in spite of it being his first week on the Supreme Court. The jurist was seen working alongside his former pastor — Monsignor John Enzler, who is now the CEO of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington — feeding homeless residents while his security detail looked on.
""Cynics might see this as a blatant attempt at image repair after the nightmare of his confirmation hearing, but the truth is ... this appears to be a regular thing for him,"" TMZ wrote. ""The Justice was also seen serving up grub to the homeless back in July with the same organization.""
Leftist comedienne Kathy Griffin was one of the anti-Kavanaugh liberals who seized on the story, saying on Twitter, ""Yet again, TMZ is serving as the PR arm of the White House...helping to normalize Trump's monsters.""

A passerby snapped a picture of the judge that went viral back in July, when he was spotted dishing up meals to the needy less than two days after his nomination was announced.
Critics alleged at that time, too, that the scene must have been a staged PR stunt.
Another volunteer, Michael Huston, defended Kavanaugh, saying ""I was there and can confirm. Also, this was no mere post-nomination photo op. Judge #Kavanaugh signed up a while back to serve on this date (as he has @CCADW on several prior occasions), and chose to keep the commitment.""

        Scarborough rips Democrat-allied 'so-called journalists' who've 'already' ruled Kavanaugh 'a rapist
    MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" co-host Joe Scarborough went on the offensive Tuesday against those in the media he deemed Democrat-allied ""so-called journalists"" who've issued serious judgments without evidence against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against him.
""We've been harshly critical of Fox News for being in the tank and being state television for Donald Trump,"" Scarborough told co-host Willie Geist and contributor Mike Barnicle as co-host Mika Brzezinski chimed in that ""it's both sides. It's everywhere. It's mainstream, all across the board.""
""Let me tell you something,"" Scarborough continued. ""What we've seen the last week has made me want to call networks and put a (D) in front of the name of the so-called journalists that have already decided that Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist or ... serial sexual abuser. Oh, really? You know that? Do you really know that?""
<U+FEFF>
""This has not been the media's finest hour, certainly in the coverage of this,"" Barnicle soon replied. ""But it's also, in terms of the United States senators, if this were a jury — and in a sense it is a jury because they're gonna vote up or down on this candidate — ... at least half the Senate would be recused from jury duty. The prosecution would say, 'No, Lindsey Graham, he can't be on this jury, he can't vote up or down on this guy because he's already already indicated [how he will vote].'""
Scarborough also mentioned Democratic senators who've sided with Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford without evidence, such as Kirsten Gillibrand of New York (""I believe her because she's telling the truth"") and Maize Hirono of Hawaii (""Well, I believe [Ford], let’s put it that way"").
Brzezinski prefaced Scarborough's declaration by saying the Tuesday program would be a ""smear-free zone"" and ""honestly, if there's smearing of Dr. Ford, or Ms. Ramirez, or Brett Kavanaugh on this show, you will be kicked off this set, 'cause we're not doing that. It's just facts.""
Here's the longer clip of the conversation. The relevant portion starts just after the 15-minute mark:

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/09/activists-call-for-boycotting-the-entire-state-of-maine-over-susan-collins-yes-vote-on-kavanaugh","
        Activists call for boycotting the entire state of Maine over Susan Collins' 'yes' vote on Kavanaugh
    In the wake of Sen. Susan Collins' (R-Maine) vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, activists are calling for a boycott against the entire state of Maine out of retaliation.
What are the details?Collins has already endured weeks of threats and intimidation leading up to Kavanaugh's confirmation, because those who opposed the justice's nomination saw the Maine lawmaker as a Republican who could be persuaded to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation.
Collins announced her decision to support Kavanaugh's confirmation on the Senate floor on Friday, and lawmakers voted 50-48 in favor of confirming Kavanaugh the next day.
But after a failed bribery scheme and multiple threats against her office, activists have upped the ante with calls to boycott the entire state of Maine until Collins is out of office.
The Portland Press Herald reported that the boycott initiative gained momentum on social media when actor and comedian John Fugelsang tweeted on Friday, ""Dear Susan Collins - I really struggled with this but my tourist $ just voted against ever visiting Maine while you remain in office.""
Fugelsang later deleted the tweet, but by that time it had already gone viral thanks to his 413,000 followers. By Monday, the Press Herald reported that Fugelsang's tweet had been liked 22,000 times and retweeted 5,000.
What are the Twitter users saying?Hundreds of Twitter users weighed in, including chefs vowing to stop buying Maine seafood, and countless others saying they would no longer vacation in The Pine Tree State. But still, others questioned the reasoning behind the ban, noting that 49 other senators voted for Kavanaugh, and a successful boycott of Collins' home state would only hurt its citizens.
This is what upsets me about #boycottmaine....50 senators voted for the Kavanaugh confirmation. If you are going to #boycottmaine, out of principal, don't go to any of the places the other 49 senators are from either. Limit your vacations to Alaska and North Dakota.— Amy Sowa (@207_amy) October 9, 2018Please don't boycott Maine. Livelihoods rely on tourism. Wages = stale & not even close to COL. It's hard AF to live here. Please don't make it harder based off what a Senator did. If you do- you have to boycott ALL states that had at least 1 vote for him or you are a hypocrite— EatLiftRunYoga (@RebelSpicer) October 9, 2018I don't think #BoycottMaine is going to work, plus it's stupid. Affecting the entire Maine economy because of one persons decision that does not exactly represent the view of all the citizens? Frankly its quite juvenile and stupid.— DAS RYAN (@chibbsthecat) October 9, 2018Others suggested donating money to Collins' 2020 opponent rather than boycotting Maine.
Rather than boycott Maine and the Portland Press Herald, donate to her challenger. She comes up for re-election in 2020 and I plan on contributing to her opponent. Word is Susan Rice is considering running against Collins.— Kasper (@recj50) October 9, 2018Mark Murrell, the owner of getMainelobster.com, told the Press Herald that he had several customers cancel their orders out of protest following Collins' vote.
He shared an email from one customer who explained, ""I've loved your product the two times I've ordered so far. However, due to Senator Collins I can no longer support products from Maine. I hope you can let her know.""
While Collins has had to increase security for her offices because of ""multiple serious threats,"" she said at an event on Sunday, ""Many people have thanked me for my vote and have said that they were very pleased I did the right thing.""

        New Yorker essay claims Kavanaugh 'weaponized crying' like 'a little boy does when he's in trouble
    An essay published by The New Yorker on Thursday offered an analysis of ""The Tears of Brett Kavanaugh."" Within it, the author asserted that when the U.S. Supreme Court nominee became emotional during testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, he ""seemingly weaponized crying, the way a little boy does when he's in trouble.""
What are the details?Writer Michael Lista said that Kavanaugh ""blubbered like a child"" in response to the sexual assault allegations made against him by accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Quoting a long list of historic figures, Lista explained how for most of Western history, men cried ""incessantly.""
Then, the Victorian era told men that weeping was a sign of weakness, Lista contended. He went on to say that in the last 50 years or so ""a counterargument has taken hold: that crying is good for a man, that his tears are the outward sign of his inward progress, the evidence and end result of his 'being in touch with his feelings.' A crying man came to be regarded as an unqualified good.""
""But,"" Lista wrote, ""Kavanaugh's performance last Thursday was something entirely different, distinctly contemporary. It combined the postwar attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings, to the point that they may cry, with the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege.""
Pointing to the fact that Justice Clarence Thomas faced similar circumstances during his own confirmation hearings with ""righteous indignation"" in calling the attacks against him ""a high-tech lynching,"" Lista added.
""Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal, though, except his own hurt feelings,"" he said. ""He is in touch with them, as he was taught to be. And so, he's seemingly weaponized crying, the way a little boy does when he's in trouble.""
Are there other examples?Lista went on to give examples of when other high-profile men have cried publicly, namely former President Barack Obama, and former Speaker of the House John Boehner.
""But Boehner and Obama's tears bear little resemblance to Kavanaugh's, which are entirely in self-pity and self-interest,"" he wrote.
The New Yorker promoted the essay on Twitter, leaving many on social media to question the author and the publication itself.

        MO-Sen: Josh Hawley and Claire McCaskill still neck-and-neck amid Kavanaugh hubbub
    The latest polling for Missouri's U.S. Senate race indicates the incumbent's decision to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hasn't moved the needle even an inch one way or the other. Challenger Josh Hawley (R) still holds a slight edge over Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in a race which remains too close to call.
What are the details?A survey by the Missouri Scout shows 48 percent of likely voters are leaning toward Attorney General Josh Hawley, while 46 percent plan to choose McCaskill. The poll was conducted Sept. 26-27, one week after   McCaskill made the decision to vote against Kavanaugh's nomination.
The Missouri Scout's latest reported numbers reflect the same results Remington Research showed in July: 48 percent for Hawley, 46 for McCaskill. The race is one of the most contentious (and expensive) in the country for this year's midterm elections, seen as an opportunity for Republicans to grab a seat held by a vulnerable Democrat.
According to McCaskill, the reason for her expected ""no"" vote on Kavanaugh has nothing to do with the sexual assault allegations against the nominee. She said in a statement that while the accusations the judge faces are ""troubling,"" her decision to vote against his confirmation has to do with ""his allegiance to the position that unlimited donations and dark anonymous money, from even foreign interests, should be allowed to swamp the voices of individuals.""
But Hawley accused McCaskill of opposing Kavanaugh for a different reason altogether. The Republican pointed to a leaked video from June, showing the senator telling supporters that she was ""physically ill"" when she got the news that Justice Anthony Kennedy was retiring.
<U+FEFF>
Tweeting a link to a Washington Free Beacon story on Sept. 28, Hawley posted, ""Here we go. New leaked video of @clairecmc shows what the Kavanaugh fight has really been about all along. Stopping nomination long enough for Dems to take control of Senate. This was NEVER about the truth. #MOSEN""
Here we go. New leaked video of @clairecmc shows what the Kavanaugh fight has really been about all along. Stopping nomination long enough for Dems to take control of Senate. This was NEVER about the truth. #MOSEN https://t.co/zZnGKfG6ud— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) September 28, 2018McCaskill attempted to stay out of the fray when asked about Kavanaugh by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch over the weekend, dismissing assertions from other Democrats that the judge didn't show the temperament needed for a spot on the nation's top court when he responded to the accusations against him during testimony last week.
""He has served on the bench for some time now,"" McCaskill said. ""He does not have a history of being inappropriately emotional or unwound on the bench, so I don't know. I know that I don't need to get to that (as a reason to oppose Kavanaugh) because I have already made up my mind.""
McCaskill went on to say that she could relate to the emotion shown by Kavanaugh while he defended himself over sexual assault allegations during his testimony.
""I come home to a husband who is not very happy about how his reputation is being sullied with lies,"" she said. ""Now I am not saying that this is the same situation, because I don't think Dr. Ford is lying.
""But I can understand that (Kavanaugh) is emotional about seeing something that he has clearly worked toward his entire life...slipping away. I think he reacted in a very emotional way and I can understand why you could have high emotion at that moment.""
McCaskill's taken heat over reports that businesses linked to her husband, businessman Joseph Shepard, have raked in $131 million in federal subsidies since she's held her Senate position.
Hawley and McCaskill will face off Nov. 6 in the midterm election. President Donald Trump won the state by 19 points in 2016.

        Commentary: If Dems are serious about believing sex allegations, then let’s look at PizzaGate again
    One of the better, or at least more entertaining, ways to defeat a false opinion in a debate is to work out the logical extreme of the faulty view. 
So let’s talk about PizzaGate. 
No, I’m not saying there’s any credibility in that absurd conspiracy theory. But what I am saying is that if Democrats and liberals are really serious about believing every allegation of sexual assault, then the FBI needs to drag Hillary Clinton and John Podesta (and pretty much every Democrat) into a dark room and interrogate them under harsh overhead lighting.
And the video of those interrogations should be recorded and published online for my unending amusement. 
Is that absurd? Of course it is. And so is the position that we need to put the burden of proof of innocence on anyone accused of sexual assault.
For those who need a refresher, “PizzaGate” was a social media fad conspiracy theory where the less savory portions of the far-right fringe pored over leaked Podesta emails finding “evidence” that there was a massive child prostitution ring run by Hillary Clinton. 
Among the “evidence” of the conspiracy was the obtuse way in which Podesta used the word “pizza” in an email thread. Someone fabricated a supposed report from the FBI that pedophiles used the word to refer to child victims, and off they want into irrational rabbit holes unsupported by facts. 
Apropos of nothing, how about we replace a few words in the paragraph above. Let’s Mad Libs this puppy and replace Podesta with Kavanaugh, and so on and so forth. Ready? GO!
Among the “evidence” of the rape narrative was the obtuse way in which Kavanaugh used the word “boof” in a yearbook notation. Someone referenced an entry in “Urban Dictionary” that said sexual deviants used the word to refer to sex acts, and off they want into irrational rabbit holes unsupported by facts. 
Wow, thats insane, isn’t it? Yes. It is. 
And this is the strange landscape that Democrats, liberals, and their media accomplices have led us into, where any allegation of sexual assault must be taken as fact until the accused is able to prove they are innocent. It is a very dangerous idea, and there are far too many people who know it but don’t care, because they know that their political advantage lies in pushing PizzaGate level absurdities against Kavanaugh. 
However, if the left is actually serious about this stuff, then please let me know when those interrogation videos are posted. If we’re going to hell in a hand basket I want to enjoy the ride.

        Kavanaugh tells committee leaders he 'will not be intimidated into withdrawing' because of 'smears
    In a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh strongly defended himself against the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him.
What did he say?Kavanaugh explained in the letter to Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)  that only after an ""exhaustive"" nomination process did he learn that the allegation against him made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had been withheld from him during the hearing process.
He went on to acknowledge a second allegation that sprung up against him on Sunday night, saying ""another false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago was published.""
""Once again, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened,"" he continued. ""There is now a frenzy to come up with something — anything — that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring.
""These are smears, pure and simple. ... they are a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country,"" the judge wrote.  ""Such grotesque and obvious charter assassination — if allowed to succeed — will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.""
Kavanaugh continued, ""As I told the Committee during my hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.""
""The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out,"" he added. ""The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.""
In closing, Kavanaugh wrote, ""I have devoted my career to serving the public and the cause of injustice, and particularly to promoting the equality and dignity of women. Women from every phase of my life have come forward to attest to my character. I am grateful to them. I owe it to them, and to my family, to defend my integrity and my name.""
Kavanaugh's final line was, ""I look forward to answering questions from the Senate on Thursday.""
BREAKING - Kavanaugh letter to Grassley pic.twitter.com/tKauHUSk6W— Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) September 24, 2018Anything else?Kavanaugh and his first accuser, Dr. Ford, are slated to testify before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
The New Yorker reported that the second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, was at first ""reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty,"" because she had been drinking the night of the alleged incident and memory gaps.
But The New Yorker said that ""after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.""

        Newspaper apologizes after outrage erupts over cartoon lampooning Kavanaugh accuser's demands
    The Indianapolis Star and a staff cartoonist have both addressed the backlash over a political cartoon printed in the paper's Sunday edition. The cartoon sparked controversy because of the artist's depiction of Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
What are the details?Cartoonist Gary Varvel drew an image of Ford testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, listing a string of demands. ""Here are my demands,"" she is depicted as saying. ""No questions from lawyers, dim the lights, I want roses, sparkling water, a bowl of green M&M's...""
Why Dr. Ford’s attorneys are guarded: vitriol masking as a joke/editorial cartoon in IndyStar Sunday. Is there an adult left standing in MSM? Show your face. pic.twitter.com/Ys4dPQPdZw— ruthholladay (@ruthholladay) September 25, 2018The Indy Star received several complaints on social media, with some readers threatening to cancel their subscriptions and others writing letters to the editor in condemnation of the cartoon.
Indy Star executive editor Ronnie Ramos responded to the hysteria in Monday's edition, acknowledging that the cartoon ""offended many readers,"" and explained that the paper ""strive(s) to present diverse opinions across the political spectrum.""
""But the Indy Star also has a responsibility to promote a civil discourse and to present diverse viewpoints in a way that does not demean or appear to belittle anyone who says they are a victim of sexual assault,"" he continued. ""Our readers deserved better in this case.""
Ramos added that ""the cartoon did not meet our high standards.""
""My cartoon was focused only on Ford's demands, not on whether she was telling the truth,"" Varvel said in the response. ""This is a point I should have made clearer in my cartoon. As a husband and father of a daughter and granddaughters, I take sexual harassment very seriously.""
Anything else?After initially agreeing to testify about her accusations against Kavanaugh, Ford has backtracked with a string of demands since her identity became public. Among those demands, she requested that the FBI first investigate the decades-old incident, which the Judiciary Committee denied. Ford also asked that she be allowed to testify after Kavanaugh about her claims, but that request was also turned down.
The committee's GOP majority told Ford's attorneys on Friday, ""This Committee has been extremely accommodating to your client. We want to hear Dr. Ford's testimony and are prepared to accommodate many of your demands, including further delaying a hearing that is currently scheduled for Monday.
""We are unwilling to accommodate your unreasonable demands. Outside counsel may not dictate the terms under which Committee business will be conducted.""
Kavanaugh and Ford are slated to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Ford claims  Kavanaugh assaulted her over 35 years ago at a house party when they were in high school. Kavanaugh has vehemently and repeatedly denied her accusations.

        Chuck Grassley furiously berates the media over their bias at media conference
    Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) lit into the mainstream media about what he called a bias against Republicans at a media conference Thursday about the impending vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
""This is almost rock bottom!""
Grassley was being asked if Republicans planned to make a criminal referral about the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford based on what many saw as inappropriate behavior. He said he knew of no plans, but used the moment to criticize the media. 
""What I'd like to do when we get all done,"" said Grassley, ""because this is almost rock bottom, I would like to have the future mending things so we could do things in a collegial way ought to, and particularly when it comes to Supreme Court nominations."" 
""And you folks can have something to do with this!"" he exclaimed, addressing the media. 
""Now I would never use the word 'fake news,' I consider you folks policemen for our democratic system of government."" 
Grassley was referring to the phrase of derision that President Donald Trump had used effectively to assail the mainstream media. 
""But I want to show you where some of you have bias,"" Grassley continued. ""I've had demonstrators in my office for two weeks now, both for Kavanaugh and against Kavanaugh.""
""And one time, the people that were for Kavanaugh wanted to be interviewed,"" he explained, ""and they said we're only interested in interviewing people against Kavanaugh."" 
""Now that's a bias that none of you should be proud of!!"" he concluded. 
Here's the video of Grassley's angry criticism:

Senators were allowed to review the FBI report and receive a briefing from staffers on its contents for an hour at a time Thursday morning. 
Democrats were incensed and called the report incomplete, while Republicans noted that the report revealed nothing new that would corroborate the allegations against Kavanaugh.

        FBI director contradicts the liberal narrative about the Kavanaugh investigation
    Although Democrats felt the FBI's supplemental background investigation into then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was extraordinarily limited by the White House, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified Wednesday that the agency completed the probe according to ""standard process,"" Politico reports.
Wray testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, where he faced questions from Democrats like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) about whether the investigation into Kavanaugh was thorough enough.
""Our supplemental update to the previous background investigation was limited in scope and that...is consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back a long ways,"" Wray replied to Harris.
But didn't he just say it was limited?Wray indeed said the investigation was limited, and that the terms of the investigation are set by the White House -- but that doesn't mean the FBI turned a blind eye or gave special treatment to Kavanaugh to allow him to get confirmed to the Supreme Court.
""As is standard, the investigation was very specific in scope, limited in scope,"" Wray said. ""That is the usual process. My folks have assured me that the usual process was followed.""
So how did the White House direct them?Wray did not get into specifics about what exactly the directive was from the White House about how to handle the investigation.
""The communication between the FBI and the White House for nominees, including judicial nominees, is through the FBI security division, background investigation specialists and the White House Office of Security,"" Wray told the committee. ""I can't speak to what anyone throughout the organization might have received instructions on.""
What else was discussed?Wray didn't just get grilled by Democrats; Republicans on the committee raised old questions about the credibility of the FBI after controversies like the Strzok/Page texts, James Comey, and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's personal email server.
""I take the credibility of the FBI, definitely, seriously,"" Wray said. ""I take anybody's concerns seriously.
""The credibility of the FBI is rock solid,"" he insisted.

        McConnell disagrees with President Trump about Murkowski's fate after Kavanaugh vote
    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) predicted Wednesday that fellow Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) will be able to keep her seat when she comes up for re-election in 2022, as the Alaskan lawmaker takes heat for her vote against the confirmation of U.S Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
What are the details?Murkowski has been under fire for not voting with the rest of her party when Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate 50-48 on Saturday. She had voted against advancing the nominee's confirmation on Friday, and announced the same day that she would vote ""no"" at Saturday's full roll call.
Ultimately, she withdrew her ""no"" vote and replaced it with ""present"" — neutralizing her position as a courtesy to fellow Republican Steve Daines (R-Mont.) who had planned to vote for Kavanaugh but was unable to attend Saturday's vote due to a family obligation.
The Alaska Republican Party is now discussing whether to issue a reprimand for the senator, after fellow Alaskan Sarah Palin hinted that she might challenge Murkowski for her seat in four years.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump told The Washington Post of Murkowski's vote, ""I think she will never recover from this. I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did.""
But McConnell told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he disagrees with the president, saying of Murkowski, ""She's certainly going to recover.""
Noting that Murkowski won her 2010 re-election with a write-in campaign, McConnell added, ""Nobody's going to beat her. She's about as strong as you can possibly be in Alaska.""
Murkowski won re-election again in 2016 with just over 44 percent of the vote, due largely to a divided opposition that saw Libertarian Party candidate Joe Miller — who had previously defeated Murkowski in the 2010 Republican primary — finishing second with 29 percent of the vote. The Democrat in the race, Ray Metcalfe, finished a dismal fourth behind Murkowski, Miller, and independent candidate Margaret Stock.
What did Murkowski say?Sen. Murkowski dismissed the president's comments about her on Wednesday, telling reporters that she knows Alaska ""better than he does."" Murkowski explained that her ""barometer is not necessarily what the president says but what the people of Alaska say.""
Murkowski went on to acknowledge that some constituents had voiced their disappointment over her vote against Kavanaugh, but said that was inevitable since voters in her state were split on whether Kavanaugh should have been confirmed.
But Politico reported on Tuesday that the Club for Growth has already dispatched a staffer to Alaska in search of a conservative challenger to run against the sitting senator, with a spokeswoman saying, ""It's clear that voters weren't happy about what Murkowski did.""
What else?Several other GOP senators have voiced their support of Murkowski after her Kavanaugh vote, but she remains the only Republican senator who has opposed two of the president's signature initiatives — repealing Obamacare and nominating a conservative judge to the Supreme Court.
One Republican senator told Politico that Murkowski might be a lame duck no matter what.
""In a state that Trump carried by [14] points, I think she's committed political suicide,"" the senator said. ""I just feel sorry for her. It just doesn't make sense.""

        Christine Blasey Ford has been nominated for an award for her Kavanaugh allegation
    Christine Blasey Ford has been nominated with an award for going public with her allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, CNN reports.
A professor at Ford's alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, nominated Ford for the Distinguished Alumna Award, crediting her for ""speaking truth to power.""
Ford graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in psychology.
""...this letter nominating Dr. Blasey Ford is not about partisan politics: it is about recognizing that the simple act of speaking one's truth, especially when that truth involves sexual assault, is an act of bravery,"" the nomination letter read.
More about the nominationFord was nominated by UNC professor Dr. Jennifer Ho. In the nomination letter, Ho cited the fact that Ford's testimony against Kavanaugh inspired many women to come forward with their own experiences with sexual assault.
""Dr. Blasey Ford giving her testimony, speaking truth to power, was an inspiration for so many of us,"" Ho wrote. ""Her testimony prompted countless women to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault.""
Ho believes Ford's testimony makes her worthy of recognition as a standout graduate of the University of North Carolina.
""Her accomplishment is to be an alumna of integrity, who despite great personal cost to herself and her family told her story of her sexual assault and emboldened others to also find the courage to speak out against injustice,"" the letter read.
The letter did not specifically address the substance of the allegations, nor did it make any mention of Kavanaugh's confirmation.
About the awardThe UNC Distinguished Alumna/Alumnus Award was established in 1971. According to the UNC Alumni Association website, the award ""recognizes alumni for outstanding contributions to humankind.""
Ford was nominated for the 2019 award, and the winner will be presented with the award on Oct. 12, 2019.

        Kavanaugh's confirmation not likely to stop liberals from plotting his impeachment
    Even though the Senate has approved Brett Kavanaugh’s ascent to the Supreme Court, liberals are likely to still seek his ouster.
What is underway?A petition to impeach Kavanaugh has more than 125,000 signatures, progressive groups are raising money to get him expelled from the high court and a prominent Democratic lawmaker is pledging to reopen an investigation into the judge if the party retakes the House in the November election, according to published reports.
“Calls for his ouster speak to the fury felt by the liberal base,” NBC News wrote.
If he's impeached, Kavanaugh would become the first Supreme Court justice in American history to be removed, the news outlet stated.
Back in 1804, Samuel Chase was impeached, but the Senate acquitted him and he remained on the bench, according to the report.
At the time of this writing, preparations were underway swear Kavanaugh in Saturday. That allows him to begin immediately working on the court, which started its term on Monday.
""An accused sexual predator who committed perjury by repeatedly lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee has no business being a judge — period,"" Heidi Hess, co-director of the liberal group CREDO Action, said. The group helped organize the Kavanaugh impeachment petition.
""We will particularly focus on making sure House Democrats know that progressives expect them to use their full power to get Kavanaugh off the bench if they gain control of the House,"" she stated in the NBC report. ""A majority of Americans opposed Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court and we believe a majority will ultimately support his impeachment as well.""
What's next?Donald Trump Jr. on Friday warned Republicans that the fight isn’t over.
The fight isn’t over,"" he tweeted. ""You better believe that Democrats are going to do everything in their power to impeach Kavanuagh from the Supreme Court if they take control of Congress in November.""

Some Democrats are also feeling the fallout.
MoveOn announced it was cancelling a six-figure ad campaign for former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who is running for the Senate. Bredesen had said Friday he approves of Kavanaugh's nomination.
But some liberals are saying that a focus on Kavanaugh is not a good strategy. Some have said it's dangerous for democracy, the report states.
""That is not happening anytime soon,"" Jim Manley, a former aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader, told the news outlet. ""I really wish folks would stop this talk of impeaching Kavanaugh and keep the focus on where it belongs"" — the midterm elections.""

        Here's why New Yorker reporters jumped on second Kavanaugh allegation -- it has to do with Ford
    Two weeks ago, The New Yorker published a highly criticized report detailing allegations by Deborah Ramirez of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh while the two were at Yale. On Monday, one of the authors of the report explained their motivation.
In an interview with Elle, reporter Jane Mayer explained that the Ramirez allegation was so attractive for them to report on because of what it could mean, if true, it would add credibility to Christine Blasey Ford's allegation.
“Her allegation showed that, if true, yes, there was a pattern of misconduct, and likely another side of the judge,” Mayer said.
What was her explanation?Here's what Mayer said when she was asked to contrast the Kavanaugh confirmation with that of Justice Clarence Thomas, which she also covered:
How was this comment received?The allegation by Ramirez was widely questioned by those on the right who noted that The New Yorker could not find any corroborating witnesses, despite its best effort. So Mayer's implication that their motivation for reporting the allegation was to boost Ford's credibility raised some eyebrows.

Ramirez was ultimately interviewed by the FBI, but the report has not been made public. Neither Republicans nor Democrats indicated that the report revealed any new information about whether Ramirez's allegation against Kavanaugh was true, although Democrats did complain that the FBI didn't interview a number of people who came forward claiming to have information.

        Hillary Clinton claims allegations against Bill, Kavanaugh are different. Her reasoning says it all.
    Hillary Clinton claimed Tuesday there is a ""significant difference"" between allegations of sexual assault against her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and those raised against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump.
CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviewed Hillary Clinton about her upcoming international tour, which will kick off in Las Vegas after the November midterms. Amanpour noted that Clinton will certainly face questions about former President Clinton's numerous sexual assault allegations.
What did she say?""Are you prepared to answer those questions? Is he prepared to answer them? Amanpour asked. ""And how do you see that, similar or different, from what President Trump is accused of? And Kavanaugh?""
""Well, I think there is a very significant difference,"" Hillary Clinton responded.
The twice-failed presidential candidate cited the Ken Starr investigation, which concluded that then-President Clinton lied under oath when he denied having sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton characterized the Starr investigation as an ""intense, long-lasting partisan investigation.""
""If, you know, the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison, they should welcome such an investigation themselves,"" Clinton said.

However, there are significant differences between the allegations of sexual misconduct against former President Clinton and those against Trump and Kavanaugh. Namely, there is evidence against Clinton — including Lewinsky's dress — while allegations against Trump and Kavanaugh stem mostly from unsubstantiated accounts.
Specifically, several women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct, but not a single witness or shred of evidence corroborated the accusers' accounts.
Also, as Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who alleges former President Clinton raped her in 1978, noted Tuesday, not every allegation against Bill Clinton has been investigated.

        ND-Sen: Embattled Heitkamp reveals why she opposed Kavanaugh—and the moment that changed everything
    North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D), who is trailing her GOP challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer, in the contentious fight for her Senate seat, revealed to CNN Monday why she ultimately decided to vote against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.
And in an unusual move of transparency, Heitkamp also admitted that she was supportive of Kavanaugh’s nomination until a turning point on Sept. 27, the day Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
What did Heitkamp say?In a feature story that followed Kavanaugh’s public swearing in ceremony at the White House on Monday, Heitkamp explained just how close she was to voting for Kavanaugh.
“I had the office begin to prepare a statement saying that I was voting for him,” she said.
But it was Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, in which he vehemently denied sexual assault allegations and defended his reputation, that changed everything for Heitkamp.
In fact, it was after Heitkamp watched Kavanaugh’s testimony again — this time with the sound off — that she decided she would not vote to confirm him. Her decision stemmed from Kavanuagh’s outward temperament.
""We communicate not only with words, but we communicate with body language, we communicate demeanor,” Heitkamp told CNN.
""I saw somebody who was very angry, very nervous, and I saw rage that a lot of people said, 'Well, of course you're going to see rage he's being falsely accused,' but it is at all times you're to acquit yourself with a demeanor that's becoming of the court,” she explained.
According to CNN, the straw that broke the camel’s back for Heitkamp was when Kavanaugh questioned Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) about her drinking history after she grilled him about his.
""When someone shows you who they are, believe them,” Heitkamp said.

How did Cramer respond?Cramer, who enjoys a substantial lead in the polls, told CNN he was surprised by Heitkamp's decision because he ""fully expected"" Heitkamp to vote ""yes"" on Kavanaugh. After all, she was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year.
""She had been building her entire campaign, really her entire brand, as the bipartisan senator from North Dakota,"" he told CNN.

        Alaska GOP may reprimand -- or totally disavow -- Sen. Murkowski for her Kavanaugh vote
    The fallout is still unfolding for Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) after she went against the rest of her party by not voting to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court over the weekend.
According to The Associated Press, the Alaska Republican Party is deciding whether to issue a reprimand for Murkowski's vote — or whether to disavow her completely.
As the only Republican senator who did not vote in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation, Murkowski has placed a target on her back, already drawing potential 2022 challengers and now facing the potential of being asked not to run as a Republican candidate again.
“It’s significant enough that I’m going to convene the whole state central committee, which is about 80 grassroots volunteers around the state, and we’ll start drafting what our response should be,” Alaska GOP chairman Tuckerman Babcock said after the vote, according to KTUU-TV.
Murkowski likely knew this backlash was coming when she made her decision, and even a formal separation from the Republican Party wouldn't necessarily spell the end of her Senate career, if the past is any indication. In 2010, Murkowski won re-election to the Senate as a write-in candidate even after losing the Republican primary.
There are at least two notable fans of Murkowski's decision in Alaska; in September Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott, a Democrat, called for Murkowski to vote against Kavanaugh -- before Ford and Kavanaugh had even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Murkowski's vote didn't technically make a difference in whether Kavanaugh was confirmed. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was a yes vote, and Montana Sen. Steve Daines was ready to come back from his daughter's wedding to vote yes if needed.
Still, Republicans all the way up to the president are not letting her off the hook for siding with the minority.
""I think she will never recover from this. I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,"" President Donald Trump said.

        Jordan Peterson says that Brett Kavanaugh should step down — but not for the reason you might think
    Psychology professor and best-selling author Jordan Peterson said that Judge Brett Kavanaugh should have stepped down from the Supreme Court when confirmed, according to tweets Peterson sent over the weekend.
What are the details?Peterson's tweet came on Friday, prior to Kavanaugh being confirmed to the Supreme Court.
In response to a tweet by former Evergreen State College professor Bret Weinstein who called Kavanaugh an ""entitled punk,"" Peterson wrote, ""If confirmed, Kavanaugh should step down.""
Weinstein had written, ""My position on the #Kavanaugh confirmation: Both outcomes are completely unacceptable. Kavanaugh was clearly, at the very least, an entitled punk through college. Nothing suggests a radical shift in mindset. He appears to be the kind of adult that entitled punk grow into.""
Weinstein's lengthy tweet added, ""Putting someone on the court who is likely to view the world through those narrow eyes is a betrayal of the most elemental American values. All the worse that the nomination came from another entitled punk. It's a divisive finger-in-the-eye-for-life to patriots of all stripes.""
If confirmed Kavanaugh should step down. https://t.co/UwsH52ts3b— Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) October 5, 2018What about the backlash?Naturally, Peterson received a lot of attention for his tweet.
Hours after Peterson sent his initial tweet about Kavanaugh stepping down from the Supreme Court, he expounded on his reason for saying so.
In a second tweet, Peterson wrote, ""I'm not certain that is the right move. It's very complex. But he would have his name cleared, and a figure who might be less divisive might be put forward.""
He later added, ""That might decrease residual alienation from the left, and make things less polarized moving forward. Of course, that has to be balanced against handing any victory to the 'believe all accusers' crowd.""
""I was thinking all this whole trying to plot out a strategy that would be least damaging, on the whole,"" Peterson continued, and noted that he's not insisting that his way of looking at the situation is the correct way.
""And I'm not jumping up and down claiming to be correct. Thought is experiment, not reality,"" he said.
""I believed if confirmed then Kavanaugh would be vindicated and could preserve his reputation (I understand the damage that has been done to him. perhaps better than most) but by withdrawing he could effectively deprive his more radical opponents of their [self-righteous] moralism,"" Peterson explained.
""As I said,"" he concluded, ""this could be wrong.""

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/05/democrats-now-want-to-impeach-kavanaugh-but-ford-says-shes-had-enough","
        Democrats now want to impeach Kavanaugh -- but Ford says she's had enough
    Even before it was clear that Judge Brett Kavanaugh had enough votes in the Senate to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, congressional Democrats announced intentions to investigate and potentially impeach him if they took control of the legislative branch.
Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in 1982, has said through her lawyers that she wants no part of it, according to CNN.
""Professor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort,"" said attorney Deborah Katz. ""What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI and that's what she sought to do here.""
It is yet to be seen whether Democrats would honor her wishes if they win big in November midterm elections.
Still, no regretsAlthough Ford's attempt to anonymously report her allegations against Kavanaugh spiraled out of control once it became public, her attorneys say Ford doesn't regret her choices.
""I don't think she has any regrets,"" said attorney Lisa Banks. ""I think she feels like she did the right thing. And this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I don't think she has any regrets.""
Democrats plan to keep fightingAlthough much of the drama surrounding Kavanaugh will mercifully subside once he's confirmed, Democrats have politically-minded plans for how to attack the judge in the future.
According to an Axios report, ""top Democratic operatives are already talking about the impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh as a 2020 campaign issue if he gets confirmed to the Supreme Court. A well-known Democratic strategist says the 'only question is: Who calls for it first?'""
The impeachment efforts would likely focus on whether Kavanaugh lied under oath at any point during his confirmation process. All of this, of course, is dependent on Democrats taking control of Congress during midterms. Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House, and a conviction requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate.

        Brett Kavanaugh makes Supreme Court history. Then CNN political analyst accuses him of 'pandering.
    Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh made history over the weekend when he officially hired four female law clerks. It’s the first time in U.S. history that a sitting Supreme Court justice employed only female clerks.
But according to a CNN political commentator on Monday, Kavanaugh is only “pandering” with the move.
What did the commentator say?CNN political analyst Joan Walsh, a renowned liberal who writes for The Nation magazine, accused Kavanaugh of “pandering” with the hires after CNN host Kate Bolduan characterized the move as an ""outreach nod to women.""
""I mean, the female clerks, I guess that's great,” Walsh said. ""He talked about that before, it felt a little like pandering to me.
""I don't know that it's going to make women who are still upset about the treatment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford feel any better. It did, it felt a lot like pandering to me,” she added.
The comments came during a panel discussion following Kavanaugh’s swearing in ceremony at the White House. The panel lambasted President Donald Trump’s tone at the event, while semi-praising Kavanaugh’s.

Is it really ‘pandering’?Walsh accused Kavanaugh of pandering, but his record as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rebuts the accusation.
In fact, as TheBlaze reported, during Kavanaugh’s 12 years on the D.C. Circuit bench, he hired mostly female law clerks, a decision Kavanaugh says was very intentional.
He told the Senate Judiciary Committee last month he chooses to hire female clerks in order to increase female representation in the federal court system.
“A majority of my 48 law clerks over the last 12 years have been women,” Kavanaugh told the committee. “In my time on the bench, no federal judge — not a single one in the country — has sent more women law clerks to clerk on the Supreme Court than I have.""

        Christine Ford's attorneys reveal significant development concerning her Kavanaugh allegations
    Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who initially accused newly confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, revealed Friday their client will not pursue additional action against Kavanaugh.
The development is very significant.
What are the details?Ford's lead attorneys, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, told CNN that Ford will not seek to have Kavanaugh impeached should Democrats regain control of Congress after the midterm elections.
""Professor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort. What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI and that's what she sought to do here,"" Katz said.
CNN host Dana Bash later asked Katz directly whether Ford wants Kavanaugh impeached. ""No,"" Katz said.
Meanwhile, Banks said Ford has no regrets about coming forward or testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""I don't think she has any regrets. I think she feels like she did the right thing,"" Banks said. ""And this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I don't think she has any regrets.""
However, despite Ford's insistence that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the summer of 1982 at a small house party in suburban Maryland, Banks and Katz made no mention of Ford filing a police report in Montgomery County, Maryland, the jurisdiction where the alleged crime occurred.
Why is this very significant?As the Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office explained last month, no person has ever come forward to file a police report in the alleged incident, which is why local law enforcement never initiated an investigation.
There have been questions about whether the statue of limitations apply, but Montgomery County law enforcement said they were prepared to investigate should Ford officially file a police report.
But she never did.
Yet she insisted during her Senate testimony that she was 100 percent certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her in the summer of 1982 despite his vehement denials.
So, if it was Kavanaugh as Ford alleges, why not file a police report? Why, now that Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court, stop pursuing the allegations altogether, especially if they are true?
That's a question Americans will need to ponder as they reflect on the Kavanaugh confirmation debacle.

        Republican Sen. Susan Collins says she won't be intimidated over her vote to confirm Kavanaugh
    Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) told WXIA-TV she will not be intimidated over her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. The Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the nation's highest court with a 50-48 vote Saturday, and he was sworn in a few hours later.
What did Collins say?Collins told the TV station she is aware that groups like the Maine People's Alliance and Mainers for Accountable Leadership, are looking to takeover her seat in 2020.
""I did not do any kind of political calculation making my decision,"" Collins said. ""I think the online crowd fundraising effort is the equivalent of trying to bribe me to take a particular position. I will not be intimidated by that no matter how much money that they raise. Essentially they were proposing a quid pro quo. I am not going to allow that kind of effort.""
Collins admitted the Kavanaugh debate was difficult.
""It's certainly been a difficult situation,"" Collins told the TV station. ""The most difficult in the 22 years I've been honored to represent the State of Maine in the United States Senate.""
Collins said her confirmation vote for Kavanaugh does not mean she is abandoning women’s rights issues. Some critics have claimed Collins has refused to meet with sexual assault survivors.
""I have met with so many Mainers that were sexual assault survivors,” she told the TV station. “I have met with them in Maine, I've met with them here (in Washington), I've met with them through video conference. I have met with many survivors of sexual assault.""
She added: ""I find it extraordinary that certain groups are now targeting me when I've been their advocate here in Washington for 22 years. My voting record clearly shows that.""
Collins also related how she felt about between Christine Blasey Ford’s emotional testimony in contrast to Kavanaugh’s strong rebuttal of the allegations dating back more than 35 years.
""I believe (Dr. Blasey Ford) was sexually assaulted and that that trauma has stayed with her throughout her life,” Collins told WXIA. ""I cannot conclude, based on the evidence and the complete lack of corroboration that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant.""
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.
What about Kavaugh's demeanor?Appearing Saturday on “Face the Nation,” Collins was asked about Kavanaugh's demeanor during the hearings. 
Asked about Kavaungh’s demeanor during the hearings, Collins said, “First let me say that I found Judge Kavanaugh’s denial at the second hearing was very powerful. His anger and his anguish, I think, are understandable given that he’s been accused of being involved in gang rapes of women. I mean, that is a devastating allegation. So I think it was understandable that he was reacting as a human being, as a father, as a father of two young girls. But, I will say that I thought his questioning, with the questioning with the senators, that he went over the line. And I was glad that he apologized to Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in particular.”

        IT'S OFFICIAL: Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with historic vote
    Brett Kavanaugh is finally a Supreme Court justice.
After months of contentious battles on Capitol Hill, which included numerous last-minute and unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, the U.S. senate approved Kavnauagh's nomination in a narrow vote Saturday that fell down party lines.
What are the details?At approximately 3:45 p.m., amid outcries from protesters in the Senate gallery, Vice President Mike Pence ordered the Senate clerk to begin calling the roll for the vote.
Ten minutes later, at approximately 3:55 p.m., all the votes were tallied. A majority 50 senators voted in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, while 48 voted against. Sen. Steve Danies (R-Mont.) missed the vote to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) withdrew her vote. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was the only Democrat to vote in favor of Kavanaugh.
Then at 4:01 p.m., Pence officially confirmed Kavanaugh as an associate justice to the Supreme Court.
Shortly after the vote, President Donald Trump applauded the Senate for confirming his ""GREAT NOMINEE.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) thanked Democratic tactics for pushing Kavanaugh across the finish line.
""It’s been a great political gift for us. The tactics have energized our base,"" he told the Washington Post. ""I want to thank the mob, because they’ve done the one thing we were having trouble doing, which was energizing our base.""
The Supreme Court's office of public information said Kavanaugh will be sworn in Saturday ""so that he can begin to participate in the work of the Court immediately."" Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the constitutional oath, while retired Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial oath in a private ceremony.
The significance of Kavanaugh's confirmation likely will not be felt for many years. Kavanaugh replaces Kennedy, who was widely known as the court's ""swing vote."" With the confirmation, the court secured a rightward shift, one that will have ramifications for decades.

        The Kavanaugh resistance crew is starting to fall apart
    The FBI and the White House have both said that the FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will only concern the first two accusers, and not the third. The first two. And that the third, Julie Swetnick — you know, the one who accused Kavanaugh of sponsoring Mad Max-type gangs of men to rape women — will not be part of the investigation.
Swetnick's attorney, Michael Avenatti, wrote on Twitter that he was ""still waiting for the FBI to contact me or my client."" Avenatti, as you probably know by now, is the same trashy lawyer that represents Stormy Daniels, the porn star suing the president — you can read about it in her tell-all memoir.
RELATED: After all that testimony, it still comes down to who you believeWell, we've since discovered that Ms. Swetnick might be far more dubious than we had imagined.
Files emerged from a lawsuit against her 18 years ago:
Ten years ago, Swetnick filed a sexual harassment complaint against then-employer New York Life. For the task, she used the same law firm that Christine Blasey Ford is using for the Kavanaugh proceedings.
When are people going to finally see through all the blatant inaccuracies and all the games and all the politics? From the first moment of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, the Democrats have done nothing but scheme and cheat and lie and disrupt. Enough is enough, America. Enough is enough.

        GOP senator reveals the gruesome text message his wife received after he voted to confirm Kavanaugh
    Republican Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) knew the left was angry about Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation. But unfortunately, he learned first-hand on Saturday just how angry Democrats are.
Gardner revealed to Fox News Sunday that after he voted to confirm Kavanaugh, his wife received a graphic text message with a video depicting a beheading. Additionally, he said his family was doxxed and some of their personal information was made public.
What are the details?Fox News reporter Chad Pergram reported:

Gardner's press secretary, Casey Contres, confirmed the reporting to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Contres added that Gardner's office may provide additional details on the threat at a later time.
It wasn't immediately clear if there were any suspects, or if law enforcement knew the source of the disturbing message.
As Fox News noted, Gardner voiced his support for Kavanaugh in July after President Donald Trump nominated him. Gardner reiterated his support for Kavanaugh after the FBI concluded its ""supplemental"" investigation into Kavanaugh's background last week.
Unfortunately, Gardner isn't the only GOP senator to be doxxed during the Kavanaugh charade. Last month, while Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee where he denied allegations of sexual assault, GOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Orrin Hatch (Utah) had their personal information posted to their public Wikipedia pages.
A Democratic intern, who most recently worked for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), was arrested last week for leaking the senators' information.

        Immigrant, minority woman' reveals what the Dem-led anti-Kavanaugh movement has forced her to do
    As the Senate is set to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court Saturday, it appears that the well-orchestrated attempt to derail his nomination has backfired.
Writing in a new essay for The Federalist, Adele Scalia — wife of Christopher Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — said she now supports Republicans after witnessing the embarrassing charade that sought to take down Kavanaugh.
What did she say?Scalia wrote:
Scalia said some might assume she is Republican because of the family she married into, but she made it clear she is not. In fact, she wrote that she ""sympathize[s] strongly with Democratic perspectives."" Now, however, Scalia said her eyes have been opened, and she sees ""that Democrats are not who they claim to be.""
""The party that established itself as a champion for the voiceless, powerless, and wrongfully accused, betrayed its values and launched a vicious attack on Kavanaugh that left him voiceless, powerless, and completely incapable of defending himself,"" Scalia wrote.
""Against all logic and good faith, they released uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct to the public, counting on the backdrop of the Me Too movement to make them that much harder to criticize or ignore,"" she added. ""I still cannot reconcile these actions with the social and criminal justice reform platforms that Democrats campaign on.""
In fact, not only is the orchestrated Kavanaugh take down not representative of supposed Democratic values, Scalia pointed out the left's hypocrisy on ""toxic masculinity.""
She said the left has ""strongly condemned men in general, and straight white men in particular, for practicing toxic masculinity,"" to which they argue that men should be vulnerable and display their emotion. But showing emotion is something Democrats condemned Kavanaugh for, arguing it shows he doesn't have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice.
""He was accused of putting on a performance. They asked what reason he, a man who was defending himself against unproven allegations of sexual assault and gang rape, whose family had been threatened and whose name had been eternally tarnished, had to cry. That is gaslighting at its most egregious, from the most vocal opponents of the sort of manipulation that is usually perpetrated against women,"" Scalia wrote.
Scalia also panned the Democratic Party for essentially using Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who initially accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, as a pawn in their anti-Kavanaugh scheme.
She wrote:
What’s worse is that to achieve all of this the left has gladly used a vulnerable woman against her wishes. Christine Blasey Ford had no intention or desire to ever become a household name. But when their initial attempts to derail Kavanaugh’s nomination failed and it seemed all but certain that he would be confirmed to the court, Democrats fed Ford to the wolves.
Only the wolves turned out to be sheep: I have seen countless Republicans defending and showing empathy for Ford on the news, giving her the benefit of the doubt on social media. By contrast, I have seen nothing of the sort for Kavanaugh from Democrats.Scalia later reiterated that witnessing the events of the last month has opened her eyes to the truth.
""These events opened my eyes to the hypocrisy of the Democratic Party. It’s actually a very exclusive club that wants me as a member based solely on stereotypes of who I am supposed to be. The core values they tout do not apply to everyone, as Kavanaugh can testify, but only to a very small, very specific subset of people who tick certain boxes or support them in their political agenda,"" she wrote.

        Brett Kavanaugh fulfills plan to become first SCOTUS justice to hire all-female staff of law clerks
    Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's newest justice, fulfilled his plan to become the first justice to hire an all-female staff of law clerks.
Kavanaugh, who was confirmed and sworn in as the 114th justice on Saturday, announced the plan during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""All four are women,"" he told the committee of the law clerk team he put together conditionally during the confirmation process and before the sexual misconduct allegations were made against him.
Christine Blasey Ford testified last month that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh categorically denied the uncorroborated accusations.
During his 12 years as a federal judge, Kavanaugh said that he had hired mostly women to improve female representation in the court, adding that he planned to hire all women if he was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.
“A majority of my 48 law clerks over the last 12 years have been women,” Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “In my time on the bench, no federal judge — not a single one in the country — has sent more women law clerks to clerk on the Supreme Court than I have.”
Who did he hire?Of the four women that Kavanaugh hired, Kim Jackson is the only one who has worked for him previously.
Jackson worked for him on the appellate court level, according to the New York Times, and like Kavanaugh, she attended Yale University.
The others — Shannon Grammel, Megan Lacy, and Sara Nommensen — have also worked for appeals court judges, the Times reported.
Grammel is a former president of the Stanford Law Review. She is a graduate of Harvard University and Stanford University, according to the Washington Post.
Lacy, a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School and Hillsdale College, formerly worked for Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
Nommensen reportedly took Kavanaugh's law class at Harvard Law School. Most recently, she worked in the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, according to the Post.
What else?Kavanaugh was confirmed 50 to 48 by the Senate on Saturday in the second tightest successful Supreme Court nomination in history, according to the National Constitution Center. In 1881, Stanley Matthews was confirmed 24 to 23.
A formal ceremony will be held in Kavanaugh's honor at 7 p.m. on Monday at the White House, according to the Washington Examiner. President Donald Trump will preside over the event.

        WATCH: Anti-Kavanaugh protesters asked if he should be given due process. Their answers are scary.
    The bedrock of the American justice system is due process, which stipulates that those accused of crimes are entitled to the presumption of innocence. Unfortunately, this foundational principle was not afforded to Brett Kavanaugh after multiple women came forward with unsubstantiated claims of sexual assault.
So how do Americans feel about this? The Daily Caller's Benny Johnson asked anti-Kavanaugh protesters this week whether Kavanaugh deserves due process and the presumption of innocence. Their answers were nothing short of stunning.
What did they say?

        SCOTUS or bust: Kavanaugh forced to withdraw from teaching gig at Harvard
    Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of being too angry, which means he must not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court. But pick any of the other eight justices already on the Court, viciously attack them in the very same way that Kavanaugh has been attacked, then evaluate their ""judicial temperament.""
Remember the part of Kavanaugh's opening statement before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday when he talked about the committee's Democrats destroying his life? He said he might not be able to teach or coach basketball again. He wasn't exaggerating.
RELATED: Does anyone think the Left will be satisfied with this FBI investigation?Over the weekend, there was an opinion piece in USA Today that said:
Think about what's being callously implied there. No evidence. No accusations prior to a couple weeks ago. But now someone is calling him unfit to be around kids. I can't imagine what Kavanaugh and his family are going through.
Now, Kavanaugh has announced he will not return to teach at Harvard Law School this coming winter term. Harvard announced that the course he was slated to teach will not be offered.
Harvard must be relieved that he withdrew instead of them having to fire him, since reportedly over 800 Harvard Law graduates have signed a letter calling on the school to dump Kavanaugh. The virtue signaling was very strong in their letter:
OK. But this was a teacher they were completely fine with just a few weeks ago. In fact, they were more than fine with him – he was a student favorite. Before his confirmation circus began, The New York Times looked at 700 pages of student evaluations of Kavanaugh over a 10-year span and found:
Kavanaugh was good enough for Elena Kagan – a female nonetheless, and one of the most left-leaning justices on the Supreme Court. She hired him to teach at Harvard Law School when she was the dean. But he's not good enough for the Senate Democrats who put her on the Supreme Court. Makes total sense.

        Veteran TV news anchor resigns from CBS affiliate after supporting Kavanaugh in Facebook post
    A veteran California broadcast journalist resigned from of KESQ-TV on Friday, less than a month after he wrote a lengthy Facebook post in defense of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's newest associate justice.
The resignation of Kris Long is effectively immediately, Gulf California Broadcast Company General Manager Jerry Upham stated on the TV station’s website. Long was a longtime evening anchor at the CBS affiliate in Palm Springs.

What did he write?According to a screenshot of the post, Long on Sept. 17 wrote on his personal Facebook page, in part: “...You are beyond dreaming if you think 17 year old boys are not going to misbehave from time to time as they begin to attempt relationships with the opposite sex. That is just the way we animals are made!” 
He also said that is not an excuse for a man to try to force himself on a woman.
“One thing is certain,"" Long wrote. ""I will never be nominated to the Supreme Court. Were that ever to happen, I have to admit they might have to enlarge the Senate hearing room to accommodate all the young women from the mid- to late-1960s who felt that I had tried to go a bit too far!” he wrote.
Long went on to categorize the sexual misconduct accusations against Kavanaugh as ""political maneuverings.""
Long later deleted the post and replaced it with an apology, according to published reports. He was reportedly not on air that night and had remained off air.
In September, the TV station stated: “Due to the nature of the post, we have chosen not to address the topic any further and apologize for any offense this has caused. We are addressing this issue internally.”
Opinions expressed in Long’s post were his own, the TV station stated, adding that it strives to offer viewers objective reporting.
Long had not been on the air since that night. Other than a brief statement, the station did not explain what was happening.
The station’s resignation announcement included a statement from Long, which read: “I want to thank those who have offered support and apologize again for any I may have offended. I hope to return to the news business in the future.""
Long’s career included reports “on every major story that has impacted the Coachella Valley, from presidential visits to the line of duty deaths of two Palm Springs police officers. Kris has also received a number of awards for his reporting, including a local Emmy for his coverage of the Salton Sea dilemma,” according to the TV station.
Long initially stood by what he wrote on Facebook, but told The Desert Sun he should have emphasized that he condemns rape. He also told the news outlet he can understand why some sexual assault victims do not immediately report the crime.
“I wish I hadn’t a written (the post) because it’s caused me a lot of headache,"" Long told the newspaper.
Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and sworn in on Saturday. In September, California professor Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Kavanaugh of unwanted sexual contact at a high school party. An FBI investigation concluded that the incident, which happened more than 35 years ago, could not be corroborated.
Three women, including Blasey Ford, publicly accused Kavanaugh. He has denied all of the allegations.
Anything else?Long’s resignation comes as journalist was fired Friday from an NBC affiliate, KTTC-TV Minnesota, after he wore a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap to cover a rally for President Donald Trump.
Another news outlet reportedly took photos of multimedia journalist James Bunner wearing the red MAGA cap, which were then circulated on Twitter.

        Writer for Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show' celebrates ruining Kavanaugh's life. Then CBS responds.
    In a social media posting on Saturday, a writer for Stephen Colbert's ""Late Show"" celebrated the damage done to Brett Kavanaugh's life after multiple women raised unsubstantiated allegations of sexual assault against him.
What happened?""Whatever happens, I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life,"" the writer, Ariel Dumas, wrote on Twitter.
Her comments immediately generated backlash. She responded by ""locking"" her account, meaning her posts were no longer public and only those following her could view her tweets.

Dumas' tweet came several hours after the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh as the newest associate justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate voted 50-48, the narrowest Supreme Court confirmation in more than a century. Only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), voted for Kavanaugh.
After widespread outrage, Dumas deleted her tweet. But alas, the internet is forever.
She later posted an apology, blaming her tweet on the ""complexity of frustration, anger and sadness,"" while characterizing the tone as an ""attempt at sarcasm.""

Dumas also removed her Twitter bio in which she identified herself as a writer for Colbert's show.
CBS, which hosts Colbert's show, confirmed Dumas is a writer for the network. A spokesman said Dumas' apology ""speaks for itself,"" according to Fox News.

        WATCH: Dem senator who questioned Kavanaugh about ‘boofing’ gets ironic nickname in new political ad
    A top Democratic senator who questioned Brett Kavanaugh about ""boofing"" during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month is the subject of a new political ad that mocks the line of questioning.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh told Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D) that ""boofing"" — a reference made in one of Kavanaugh's high school yearbooks — referred to flatulence.
What does the ad say?The ad comes from Bob Flanders, the Republican nominee challenging Whitehouse for his Senate seat.
""With all the world watching, Senator Whitehouse asks about....flatulence,"" the ad's narrator says. ""What an embarrassment for Rhode Island.
""Let's elect a problem solver — not a gasbag,"" the narrator adds.
According to Webster's Dictionary, a gasbag is ""an idle or garrulous talker,"" meaning a person who is ""pointlessly or annoyingly talkative.""
Indeed, after the emotional Sept. 27 hearing, Whitehouse was widely mocked for using his five minutes to question Kavanaugh about ""boofing"" and another yearbook reference to ""the devil's triangle."" Kavanaugh's detractors alleged the latter referred to a sexual act. Kavanaugh, however, said it was a drinking game his friends created; those friends later corroborated Kavanaugh's testimony.

        Kavanaugh sworn in as Supreme Court justice just hours after 50-48 confirmation vote by Senate
    Just hours after the Senate voted to confirm him to the nation's highest court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was sworn-in as the 114th Supreme Court justice late Saturday, according to published reports.
What are the details?Chief Justice John Roberts performed the private ceremony, and Justice Kavanaugh is now ready to hear cases before the court on Tuesday.
The Senate’s 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh earlier Saturday followed a week-long FBI investigation of sexual assault allegations against him. The allegations, which dated back to Kavanaugh's high school years, nearly prevented his nomination. He also faced a contentious and emotional hearing process before a Senate committee. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations and the FBI found no supporting evidence.
An estimated 1,000 protesters showed up outside the Capitol steps and chanted “November is coming,” according to Fox News.
Saturday’s vote was the closest successful Supreme Court confirmation in more than 100 years, according to Fox News. It was also closer than the vote for Clarence Thomas, who also had faced sexual misconduct accusations.
The vote followed party lines, with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) casting the only Democrat “yes” vote, according to reports. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted against Kavanaugh’s appointment.
What are people saying?Following the vote, Democrats urged supporters to take to the polls in the November midterm election.
“The American people are raising their voices to a deafening roar today. We will not stop marching, we will not stop fighting, and we will vote on Election Day for leaders who share our values,” Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez said in a statement.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Saturday’s events a ""heartbreaking day for women, girls and families across America."" Pelosi also announced she is filing a Freedom of Information Act request to review documents surrounding the FBI’s investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.
Despite the comments and protests, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnnell (R-Ky.) called it a ""a good day for America and an important day for the Senate.""
""We stood up for the presumption of innocence, we refused to be intimidated by the mob of people coming after Republican members at their homes and hallways,"" he said.
Kavanaugh replaces Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired in July. Kennedy was known as ""the swing justice,"" although he leaned to the conservative side.
President Donald Trump congratulated Kavanaugh on Twitter:

        Collins, Manchin announce 'yes' votes on Kavanaugh, likely paving the way for confirmation
    Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced on Friday that she planned to vote ""yes"" on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. Immediately following Collins' speech, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced that he would also vote ""yes,"" likely paving the way for Kavanaugh's final confirmation.
Here's what you need to knowIn a speech on the floor of the Senate, Collins said:
""Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.""
She called him an ""exemplary citizen, judge, coach, teacher and father,"" and said that she thought he would heal divisions in the court.
Collins said that despite the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh was entitled to a ""presumption of innocence"" in light of what she believed to be a lack of compelling evidence. Collins called the allegations by Julie Swetnick that Kavanaugh was involved in drugging and gang raping girls ""outlandish.""
She said that she found Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to be ""sincere, painful, and compelling,"" and that she believes that Ford is a survivor of sexual assault. However, Collins noted that the witnesses named by Ford could not corroborate that the incident occurred. Citing denials by Kavanaugh and his friends, and a lack of other corroborating evidence, Collins said that she didn't believe ""these charges can clearly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.""
Collins slammed the nomination process, saying that when Kavanaugh was nominated, ""special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one that didn't even bother to write in the judge's name on his press release.""
Collins was referring to the Women's March, which quickly sent out an email after Kavanaugh's nomination was announced, but forgot to remove the placeholder letters ""XX,"" which had been typed in place of the nominee's name.
Collins argued that she did not think that Kavanaugh would scrap the entire Affordable Care Act if given the opportunity, or overturn existing precedent without a good reason.
What else?Collins was one of the few remaining senators who had not declared either for or against Kavanaugh.
Earlier on Friday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another previously undecided senator, announced that she would be voting against Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Murkowski has already voted ""no"" during the procedural vote, during which the Senate voted 51-49 to end the debate on Kavanaugh and move forward with the final vote. However, later on Friday Murkowski indicated to reporters that she was still undecided.
On Thursday, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) announced that she would be voting against Kavanaugh.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has said that he will vote yes ""unless something big changed"" before the vote was held.
Manchin voted to end the debate and hold a final vote. Fox News reported immediately after Collins' speech that Manchin would also be a ""yes"" vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.
Including Flake, Collins, and Manchin, the Republicans currently have 51 declared ""yes"" votes. As long as the Republicans still have at least 50 votes when the final vote on Kavanaugh is held, Vice President Mike Pence can use his tie-breaker vote as president of the Senate to push them to the 51 votes they need to confirm him.
This piece has been updated to reflect Manchin's announcement of a 'yes' vote.

        BREAKING: Senate votes to end debate on Kavanaugh nomination, move to a final vote
    The U.S. Senate voted Friday to end the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. A vote on whether or not to approve his nomination will take place on Saturday.
Here's what you need to knowThe motion passed by a slim 51 to 49.
This vote was a procedural vote, on whether the Senate should end the debate on Kavanaugh's nomination and move forward to a final vote.
Notably, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted ""no."" Murkowski was one of three senators currently considered to be swing votes. The others are Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had been considered a swing vote, before Senate Republicans granted him a delay so that the FBI could conduct a further investigation into allegations of past sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh. That investigation ended on Thursday.
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) had been considered a swing vote, until Thursday when she declared that she would vote against Kavanaugh's nomination. She also voted no during this procedural vote.
According to CNN, Collins will announce how she will vote on Kavanaugh during a speech on the floor of the Senate at 3 p.m. ET Friday. Collins told reporters before the vote that she would be voting to proceed, but that she would ""announce my intentions on how to vote later today.""
What can we expect Saturday?Manchin voted ""aye"" on Friday. He has indicated, according to the Washington Post's Glenn Kessler in a now-deleted tweet, that his final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination would be the same as his vote on Friday. If he holds true to this, even if Collins votes no, Republicans would have 50 votes for Kavanaugh (assuming that Flake votes to confirm him). At that point, Vice President Mike Pence could step in and cast a tie-breaker vote to push Kavanaugh's nomination through.
To date, only 10 U.S. presidents have had Supreme Court nominees rejected by the Senate: Washington, Madison, Tyler, Polk, Buchanan, Grant, Cleveland (twice), Hoover, Nixon (twice), and Reagan.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

        Trump predicts GOP Sen. Murkowski will not recover for 'no' vote on Kavanaugh confirmation
    Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) will not recover politically for voting against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump predicted Saturday.
What happened?“I think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,” Trump told the Washington Post.
Kavanaugh was confirmed Saturday, following intense scrutiny and sexual misconduct allegations that were recently raised and dated back to his high school years. Kavanaugh denied the allegations and an FBI investigation found no corroborating evidence.
Trump predicted Mukowski would face defeat if she chooses to seek reelection in 2022.
“She doesn’t run for four years,” he told the news outlet. “She’s lucky.”
On Friday, Murkowski voted “no” on a procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination. She also opposed his confirmation on Saturday.
“She will never recover from this,” Trump told the Washington Post.
The vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation had a one-week delay so the FBI could investigate the allegations. That “turned out to be a great thing,” Trump said, “a blessing in disguise.”
The president also praised Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) for her “yea” vote for Kavanaugh.
“I think what Susan Collins did for herself was incredibly positive,” Trump said. “It showed her to be an honorable, incredible woman. I think she’s got a level of respect that’s unbelievable. I really mean it.”
What did Sarah Palin say?Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin tweeted at the senator on Friday: “Hey @LisaMurkowski — I can see 2022 from my house...”

It wasn't clear if Palin was seriously hinting that she might re-enter politics.
“I don’t know anything about that,” Trump reportedly said. “It’s four years. That’s a long time. But they will not forget. They will never forget. What she did was unacceptable. Really unacceptable.”
Murkowski lost a Republican primary in 2010 to Tea Party challenger Joe Miller. She went on to win in the general re-election by launching a robust write-in campaign.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/27/heres-how-many-questions-democrats-asked-kavanaugh-about-the-allegations-against-him","
        Here's how many questions Democrats asked Kavanaugh about the allegations against him
    The Senate Judiciary Committee came together Thursday morning, presumably to hear from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing him of sexually assaulting her in 1982.However, when it came time to question Kavanaugh about the alleged assault, which he denies, the Democratic members of the committee seemed to want to ask about everything else except what did or did not happen between Kavanaugh and Ford.Their lack of interest in the specific allegation in question is reflected in the fact that Democratic senators asked Kavanaugh exactly zero questions about the allegation Ford made against him. Not one.Wait, so what did they ask?Well, they asked him about slang in his school's yearbook, including a baffling exchange between Kavanaugh and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse in which the senator inquired about the meaning of the word ""boofed"" (you probably don't want to Google that one).
They asked him broadly about his drinking habits; whether he had ever had too many beers, whether he's ever passed out or blacked out while drinking, and whether he's ever had memory lapses caused by alcohol. Not on the night of the alleged sexual assault, just in general.
They asked if he believed Anita Hill's 1991 testimony that Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her, for some reason.
But mostly, they asked him about the FBI.
All about the FBISenator after senator grilled Kavanaugh about the FBI. Would you submit to an FBI investigation? Why haven't you requested one? Are you scared of what the FBI might find? Why don't you turn to White House counsel Don McGahn right now and tell him to go to President Donald Trump to open an FBI investigation?
Indeed, the primary point that Democrats seemed to be driving at was that it should be Kavanaugh's responsibility to go to the president and request that the FBI investigate him for a crime he has sworn under oath that he did not commit. Even though, in his years of government and judicial service, Kavanaugh has been investigated by the FBI numerous times.
""Why don’t you just ask the president?"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked. ""Mrs. — Dr. Ford can’t do this. We clearly haven’t been able to do this. But just ask the president to reopen the FBI investigation.""
The Democrats, while demanding that the confirmation vote be postponed to give more time for investigation, repeatedly dodged and overlooked the damning fact that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) held on to knowledge of Ford's allegation for more than a month without notifying the committee.
""I cannot let it go by what you’ve heard me say so many times, that between July 30th and September 13th, there were 45 days this committee could have been investigating this situation and her privacy would have been producted — protected,"" Sen. Grassley said.
Republicans, showing some awareness of the reason for the hearing in the first place, did repeatedly and directly ask Kavanaugh questions about the specific sexual assault allegation from Ford. Same goes for Rachel Mitchell, the outside prosecutor they hired to question Ford and Kavanaugh.There may be more reasons for why senators would show up to a hearing about a sexual assault allegation and not ask about the sexual assault. But many times, people don't bother asking questions about subjects on which they've already made up their mind.

        Senate Democrats want these people interviewed by the FBI for the Kavanaugh investigation
    With the FBI's investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh underway, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the White House and the FBI with a list of subjects they believe must be interviewed, according to CNN.
Democrats have been expressing concern that the length and scope of the FBI's investigation won't be sufficient to thoroughly get to the bottom of Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982, and now they want to ensure that the other two women accusing Kavanaugh are interviewed as well.
“We ask that you confirm that the FBI background investigation will include the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick and that the FBI will perform all logical steps related to these allegations, including interviewing other individuals who might have relevant information and gathering evidence related to the truthfulness of statements made in relation to these allegations,"" the Democrats' letter read.
All but one Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) did not sign.
Who do they want interviewed?The list includes the obvious investigation subjects, such as Kavanaugh and Ford, as well as the friends Ford named who allegedly attended the party Ford said she was assaulted at.
Others include high school and college friends of Kavanaugh's, Ford's husband, and friends Ford may have spoken to about the assault. It is unclear how some names on the list connect to Kavanaugh or any of his accusers.
Here is the full list, published by CNN:

        Facebook employees melt down because company VP sat behind friend Kavanaugh at hearing
    A Facebook executive has apologized after his appearance at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford caused ""outrage"" among employees, according to The New York Times.
Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, sat behind Kavanaugh during the hearing; the two are friends. Many employees, however, interpreted Kaplan's support for his friend as offensive to women and sexual assault victims.
""Let's assume for a minute that our VP of Policy understands how Senate hearings work,"" one employee wrote in an internal post. ""His seat choice was intentional, knowing full well that journalists would identify every public figure appearing behind Kavanaugh. He knew this would cause outrage internally, but he knew that he couldn't get fired for it. This was a protest against our culture, and a slap in the face to his fellow employees.""
Why was Kaplan at the hearing?Kaplan is a former Marine who also clerked for two conservative justices in the past. He has been friends with the Kavanaughs for quite some time.
""I have known Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh for 20 years,"" Kaplan wrote in a note. ""They are my and my wife Laura's closest friends in D.C. I was in their wedding; he was in ours. Our kids have grown up together.""
Despite the fact that he was simply supporting a friend, not making a political statement or widely dismissing sexual assault victims, Kaplan apologized.
""I want to apologize,"" Kaplan wrote in a note to Facebook staff. ""I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one — internally and externally.""
Did anyone defend him?CEO Mark Zuckerberg told the staff that Kaplan broke no company rules by attending the hearing, saying Kaplan had a right to make a personal decision to attend and he still trusted his VP's judgment.
Some employees, according to The New York Times, said Zuckerberg's comments caused ""stress and trauma"" because it seemed like Zuckerberg was shrugging off Ford's testimony.
Veteran Facebook employee Andrew Bosworth said employees need to choose paths in life even if they differ from the company they work for — and was quickly pushed to apologize after an uproar.
""If you need to change teams, companies or careers to make sure your day-to-day life matches your passions, we will be sad to see you go, but we will understand,"" Bosworth wrote in an internal post. ""We will support you with any path you choose. But it is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.
The next day Bosworth walked back his comment and said he made a ""big mistake"" by speaking up and that he was sorry he ""caused employees pain and frustration.""
The company has scheduled a meeting for Friday to give employees a chance to address their concerns about Kaplan's attendance at the hearing.

        NBC's Chuck Todd drops major admission about Michael Avenatti's role in anti-Kavanaugh charade
    NBC News anchor Chuck Todd admitted Friday that Democratic lawyer Michael Avenatti, who is best known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, helped dilute the allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh, ultimately aiding the judge to the Supreme Court.
Avenatti inserted himself into the Kavanaugh controversy last month when he surfaced a third accuser. That accuser alleged Kavanaugh drugged women and participated in gang rapes during his youth.
What did Todd say?""Michael Avenatti is probably the best thing to happen to Brett Kavanaugh. All these Democrats that have been flirting with him, they've got to really be embarrassed by him now,"" Todd said Friday on ""MTP Daily.""

Todd added that Avenatti ""diluted"" the accusations raised by Christine Blasey Ford, which ultimately ""cheapened the whole thing.""
Todd's comments came during a panel discussion on comments Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) made from the Senate floor Friday, when she announced she would vote for Kavanaugh and explained why in thorough detail. 
During her speech, Collins invoked Avenatti — though not by name — to explain why she doubts that Kavanaugh is guilty of the allegations against him, and more importantly why the presumption of innocence is a vital component of justice.
Collins said:
Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important. I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor [Christine Blasey] Ford, but of the allegation that when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used this weakened state to participate in gang rape. This outlandish allegation was put forward without any supporting evidence and simply parroted in the public statements of others.
That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.Avenatti later responded to Collins on social media, accusing her of ""channeling Donald Trump,"" while saying she ""should be ashamed of herself for attacking my client and Dr. Ford"" with her ""disingenuous and shameful"" Senate speech.
Kavanaugh vehemently denies all allegations against him. The Senate is expected to vote on his confirmation for the final time Saturday afternoon.

        Ford's lawyers agree to turn over evidence on Kavanaugh -- if the FBI agrees to an interview
    On Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) requested material evidence from Christine Blasey Ford and her lawyers related to her allegation of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. On Wednesday, Ford's lawyers responded — but with some conditions.
The Hill reported that Ford's attorneys have agreed to fulfill Grassley's request, but only if the FBI agrees to interview Ford as a part of its weeklong supplemental investigation into Kavanaugh.
As of Wednesday, Ford's attorneys said she hasn't been contacted for an interview, and Bloomberg reported that the FBI was not given permission to interview either Kavanaugh or Ford for the brief investigation, since the two already testified extensively about the case.
Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is frustrated that material evidence is being withheld from the committee's consideration. Ford's lawyers call it ""inconceivable"" that the FBI would conduct an investigation without interviewing the two primary subjects of the allegations in question.
Grassley expressed disappointment Wednesday in Ford's lawyers' demand for an FBI interview in exchange for evidence.
""The Constitution tasks the Senate, not the media or the FBI, with providing advice and consent for Supreme Court nominees,"" Grassley said in a statement. ""It's disappointing that Dr. Ford's attorneys were willing to share evidence with The Washington Post many weeks ago but to this day refuse to share the same evidence, which Dr. Ford relied on in her testimony, with the Senate.""
Grassley had requested Ford's therapist notes, any recordings of her August polygraph test, and text messages exchanged between Ford and a Washington Post reporter. He raised specific concerns about the polygraph after Ford's ex-boyfriend sent a letter claiming Ford has coached someone on a polygraph before, something she denied under oath.
Fox News reported that the Senate Judiciary Committee should have the results of the FBI's investigation by Thursday morning.

        Palin vs. Murkowski? Former governor issues possible Senate challenge over Kavanaugh vote
    Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was the only Republican to vote ""no"" in a procedural vote that put Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh one step away from finally being confirmed, which caused former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to issue a veiled threat on Twitter.
Palin, who had been calling for Murkowski to support Kavanaugh, asking the senator to ""do the right thing."" After the vote, Palin indicated that the decision to oppose Kavanaugh might cost Murkowski her seat.
""Hey @LisaMurkowski - I can see 2022 from my house..."" Palin wrote on Twitter. Murkowski's Senate term ends in 2023, and Palin's message led some to believe Palin may challenge for the seat. The wording was a reference to a Saturday Night Live skit that made fun of Palin.

Palin wasn't the only one to question whether Murkowski's run as Alaska senator needed to end. Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeted: ""I like Alaska...a lot. Maybe it's time to run for Senate after all. @lisamurkowski has abandoned all principles of due process and fairness. Disgraceful. #ConfirmKavanaugh.""

A politically unique stateMurkowski has an interesting history with Palin. Murkowski's father, former Gov. Frank Murkowski, appointed his daughter to the Senate in 2002 -- picking her over Palin.
Palin was governor of Alaska from December 2006 until July 2009, having defeated Murkowski's father in the primary. Palin supported Republican candidate Joe Miller in the 2010 Senate race, and Miller beat Murkowksi in the primary -- but Murkowski defied party leaders to win as a write-in candidate.
In 2016, Murkowski won the Republican Primary, but Miller still ran against her as a Libertarian candidate.
In short, the politics in Alaska are not like the politics in most states, and Murkowski's relationship with the Republican Party is such that she is less likely than most to feel obligated to vote the party line.
Additionally, the issue of sexual violence is of particular sensitivity in Alaska, which has the highest rate of sexual assault in the country, and is especially high among Native women -- a key coalition of support for Murkowski.
Murkowski's against-the-grain vote on Kavanaugh, combined with her contentious history with Palin, means that in the coming years she may find herself in a somewhat familiar position -- battling against the Republican establishment.
""There will be long-term resentment among Republican voters due to Sen. Murkowski's lack of courage today,"" said Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, according to The New York Times. ""Conservative women never forget.""

        Poll: Republicans angry, energized to vote after Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation
    A new Rasmussen poll reports that Republican voters are angry over the way Justice Brett Kavanaugh was treated during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in the wake of sexual assault allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
In fact, they're reportedly so angry that they're even more likely to vote in November's midterm elections.
What are the details of the poll?A new Rasmussen Report noted that 54 percent of likely U.S. voters are more likely to vote in the November midterm elections as a result of the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh. Thirty-four percent of respondents said that the controversy would have zero impact on their voting, and just 9 percent of respondents reported that they were less likely to vote as a result of the Kavanaugh controversy.
The poll also found that 62 percent of Republicans are more likely to vote in response to the Kavanaugh controversy when compared to 54 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of unaffiliated voters.
Sixty-two percent of voters said that they are angry about the way Kavanaugh was treated by the U.S. Senate, with 42 percent who report that they are ""very angry."" Sixty-four percent of Republicans consider themselves to be ""very angry"" about the way the Senate treated Kavanaugh. Thirty percent of Democrats polled agreed, as well as 34 percent of unaffiliated voters.
Fifty-six percent of all voters polled said that they are angry about the way the Senate treated Ford, with 35 percent of all voters polled who said they are ""very angry."" Forty-eight percent of Democrats were ""very angry"" about the way the Senate treated Ford, while 28 percent of Republican voters and 30 percent of unaffiliated voters agreed.
According to the report, 72 percent of voters who self-reported to be ""very angry"" about Kavanaugh's treatment are more likely to vote in the November election. Seventy percent of voters who self-reported to be ""very angry"" about Ford's treatment are more likely to vote in the November election.
The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters between Oct. 7 and Oct. 8. The margin of error is 3 percentage points and has a 95 percent level of confidence.

        Hillary Clinton laughs off Kavanaugh's 'revenge' remark, criticizes judge for being defensive
    Brett Kavanaugh accused Democrats of trying to smear his good name as a way to get ""revenge on behalf of the Clintons"" for role in helping get former President Bill Clinton impeached.
Clinton, in response to those remarks Tuesday, laughed them off, according to Politico.
""I told someone later, 'Boy, I tell you, they give us a lot of credit — 36 years ago we started this against Kavanaugh,'"" Clinton said at The Atlantic Festival.
Kavanaugh worked with independent counsel Ken Starr during the investigation into Bill Clinton, and wrote a memo calling out Clinton's ""callous and disgusting behavior"" with then-intern Monica Lewinsky.
Clinton also accused Kavanaugh of being defensive during Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing -- an odd criticism, considering his only role at that hearing was to defend himself against an allegation that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school.
""I thought it was part of the whole of his very defensive and unconvincing presentation,"" Clinton said. She also said Kavanaugh's performance was ""out of bounds,"" and that she'd never seen anything like it in that setting.
Clinton also said at the festival that she believes Ford's story, questioning why anyone would put themselves through the what Ford has gone through for false allegations.
""You have to ask yourself, why would anybody put themselves through this if they did not believe that they had important information to convey to the Senate?"" Clinton said. ""She said it was her civic duty.""
While some view the situation with Kavanaugh and Ford as creating a divisive conflict between men and women, Clinton said she simply sees the scales evening out to be fair to women in society.
""I don't see it so much as some kind of conflict as finally righting the balance, because there's been a tremendous imbalance on women's lives, women's narratives — they've been historically dismissed, condescended to,"" Clinton said.

        NYT finds the smoking gun: Kavanaugh... threw ice at someone!
    You know, there's two sides of a coin for every benefit technology brings. Take social media and the internet. Before they existed, journalists had a stranglehold on the mass flow of information and opinion. If you wanted to have a voice, you had to go through your local paper, local news, or maybe even cable news or national publication like the New York Times. But social media has changed all that. If you've got a hot take or maybe just saw some breaking news, you can instantly self publish and blast that information out to the entire world.
RELATED: Let's stop pretending the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh is credibleBut here's the flip side to that coin. If you work at a news outlet that's supposed to be impartial, anything you've ever blasted out on the interwebs is instantly available to check your impartial or biased bonafides. Take staff writer for the New York Times, Emily Bazelon. On July 9, she tweeted:
That was just three months ago exercising her ability, as we all share, to be an independent opinion maker on a social media platform. Well, Monday afternoon, Emily exercised her other platform at the New York Times with a holy crap bombshell on Brett Kavanaugh. The allegations are straight horrifying. If you have small children in the room or in the car, you might want to hold their ears for a second. Here we go. Emily reported that in September of 1985, Brett Kavanaugh… THREW ICE AT SOMEONE!!!!
Yes, that's where we're at right now. The frigging New York Times is reporting on ice throwing. Oh but surely there were arrests made and charges field right? Well… no. Neither of those things happened.
So what the hell is this all about? It's quite obvious that this story doesn't, nor should it, live up to the editorial standards of the New York Times. Someone threw ice? I mean, are you kidding me? Emily Bazelon's tweets make it obvious that she's opinionated against Brett Kavanaugh. So now, the New York Times has been caught publishing a supposed ""journalist"" being an activist. And this is no mistake. How did this story get through the Times editorial staff? Maybe because they're activists as well?
Get used to it America. We've got a full week of this as we get closer to the vote. I predict the ridiculousness escalates to full-on clown show. A clown show in the media, leading up to a circus in the Senate. Get your peanuts, cotton candy and popcorn ready.

        Report: Arizona US Senate candidate Martha McSally supports Kavanaugh nomination
    U.S. Senate Republican nominee Martha McSally said she would vote in favor of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh if she was currently serving in the U.S. Senate.
What did she say?“At this point, based on what I know, unless there are some revelations in the FBI investigation, I would vote for Brett Kavanaugh,” McSally said during an interview with KTAR-FM on Wednesday.
On Thursday, Senate Republicans said the FBI’s investigation did not turn up any new or corroborating information. In contrast, Democrats called the report incomplete.
McSally is facing Rep. Krysten Sinema, (D-Ariz.), for the Senate seat of retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). The highly competitive Arizona race is considered one of the most important in the Democrats' quest to flip the Senate in the November midterm elections.
McSally told the radio station her “heart breaks for Judge Kavanaugh and his family and what they’ve been through. There is a reality. There are people, to include many in the Democrats, that just want to destroy this guy, that want him to go down. They want to win the Senate back over. They want to stop a judge of his caliber of any like, no matter who it is.”
She also empathized with Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser.
“...My heart goes out to Dr. Ford. I mean, anyone who is sharing experiences in their lives that — she truly has been through trauma.” McSally said. “My heart breaks for her.”
McSally has also shared that she was sexually abused while she was in high school by a coach who was fired after she reported it.
What about fair processes?Still, there must be fair processes in place any time accusations are raised, McSally said.
“I’m very frustrated about the Democrats and how they really dealt with Dr. Ford. I think the fact that she appeared to not even know they offered to come out to California to meet with her, that it could have happened in private, I think is a travesty quite frankly. So we are where we are. There is no other corroboration to her story. We have the life and the experiences and the six FBI background checks, and a supplemental...""Anything else?On Thursday, some Republican swing senators said they were satisfied with the FBI’s investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. That led to speculation that they could back him, according to published reports.
Flake requested that the FBI re-open its investigation into Kavanaugh following testimony by Christine Blasey Ford before a Senate committee last week.
He reportedly said the FBI report showed no corroborating evidence against Kavanaugh, but added that he plans to read it more closely.

        Republican lawmakers hiring police escorts amid increasingly tense Kavanaugh protests
    The fight over Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation has led to increased security at the Capitol, The Associated Press reported.
Some lawmakers are using police escorts to fend off aggressive confrontations from protesters, the report states. Central to the battle over Kavanaugh is the likelihood that he would have the fifth deciding vote for a conservative majority on the nine-member court.
Emotions are also running high over an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations raised against Kavanaugh. The investigation has been completed, and was made available for senators to review this morning.
What is going on?Over the past few days, Capitol police have arrested “dozens of people” for “unlawfully demonstrating” in Senate office buildings, according to the report.
Three police officers escorted Sen. Susan Collins, (R-Maine) from a hearing Wednesday. Collins is viewed as a key undecided vote.
Outside Collins’ office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, police threatened to clear a public hallway and blocked reporters from approaching her. A Collins spokesperson had no comment about her security detail, the report said.
Republican senators have said they are concerned about confrontations with protesters that have happened at their Senate offices, their homes, and public places such as restaurants and airports. Some lawmakers have had their private information posted online.
A former Senate staff member, Jackson Cosko, 27, of Washington, faces charges for posting personal information about one or more senators online, as TheBlaze reported last night. Cosko was charged late Wednesday with making public restricted personal information, unauthorized access of a government computer and other crimes, according to the report.
From January 2017 to May 2018, Cosko worked for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire as a legislative correspondent/systems administrator, the report states. A spokesperson for Hassan had no comment Wednesday night. Cosko also worked in the past for the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Democratic member, Dianne Feinstein (Calif.).
Republican lawmakers had discussed security issues earlier this week at a private luncheon.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-Ky.) has said senators will not be intimidated while performing their jobs.
There is “a lot of unprecedented activity taking place,"" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)
""People have been acting out in ways that really is inappropriate,"" Corker said Wednesday. ""The polarity we have right now and the way people are responding to it — let's face it, the nation is very, very divided. People are resentful and angry.
""This is the worst it's been since I've been here,” said Corker, who is retiring in January after serving two terms in the Senate.
Last week, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was forced to leave a restaurant. Other lawmakers have had “organized far-left protesters” camping outside of their homes and offices.
""There is no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty,"" McConnell said.
Two women approached Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) outside the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room on Wednesday and tried to give him a written statement against Kavanaugh. Hatch, a Kavanaugh supporter, refused to take the paper and kept walking. The women reportedly followed him and continued to shout questions at him.
Last week, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake was confronted by women at an elevator during a televised exchange that went viral. Flake later forced Republicans to delay voting on Kavanaugh until the FBI can complete another background investigation.
What's next?The Senate is expected to have a cloture vote Friday on Kavanaugh's nomination, which means that a final floor vote could happen in the next couple of days.

        White House reportedly says FBI report offers no support for Kavanaugh accusers
    The White House has reviewed the report from the FBI's investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and found no evidence of corroboration regarding the accusation of sexual misconduct, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual misconduct by college professor Christine Blasey Ford at a house party in 1982 and by Deborah Ramirez when they were both students at Yale University.
Here's what you need to knowCiting “people familiar with the matter,” the Journal reported Thursday that the White House did not think that the FBI investigation supported any of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
Ultimately, regardless of what the White House determined, the final decision on how to interpret the FBI report lies with the Senate.
White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah tweeted at 2:24 a.m. Thursday that the White had had received the FBI's report, sent it to the Senate, and that they were “fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.” In his tweeted statement, Shah did not indicate what the White House had concluded from the report, aside from it being “comprehensive.”

With McConnell’s cloture filing, senators have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation. This is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple (2/3)— Raj Shah (@RajShah45) October 4, 2018committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents. With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.” – White House Spokesman Raj Shah (3/3)— Raj Shah (@RajShah45) October 4, 2018Who has access to the report?Only senators and a small handful of Senate staffers will have access to the report.
To prevent leaks, the Senate received only a single, paper copy of the report, which is being kept in a secure room. Senators and nine Senate staffers are able to go into the room itself and view the report, but were not permitted to make copies. The report will not be made public.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters that he hoped keeping the pool of people who could read the report limited would make witnesses more likely to talk to the FBI.
“If you want people to be candid when they talk to the FBI, you ain't going to make that public,” he said.
This is a developing story and may be updated.

        Teacher resigns after tweeting death threat about Justice Brett Kavanaugh
    A Minnesota teacher has resigned from her position after she appeared to suggest that someone should assassinate newly appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The unidentified teacher — who shared a Saturday tweet that said, ""So whose [sic] gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?"" — was initially placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the incident.
On Tuesday, however, the district announced that the teacher had voluntarily resigned.
The educator, who formerly taught at the Intermediate School District 917’s Alliance Education Center in Rosemount, worked as a special education teacher.
In a statement shared on the district website, Superintendent Mark Zuzek addressed the controversy.
He wrote, ""On Sunday, October 7, 2018, the district began receiving complaints regarding an employee. The actions of the employee did not occur at school, and there were no school devices, equipment, or other school staff involved in the actions.""
Zuzek's statement noted that ""[a]t no time were students or staff in danger,"" and added that the unnamed employee was initially ""placed on paid administrative leave and an investigation conducted.""
""The employee has voluntarily resigned from their position with the school district, and therefore is no longer employed by Intermediate School District 917,"" Zuzek's statement added.
The statement concluded, ""Pursuant with the Minnesota Data Practices Act, we are limited to providing additional information regarding this matter.""
It is not clear at the time of this writing if law enforcement will be investigating the teacher's tweet.

        Grassley again demands Ford turn over 'material evidence' of alleged Kavanaugh assault
    Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is giving Christine Blasey Ford and her legal team one more chance to turn over material evidence supporting her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, according to a letter obtained by Fox News.
Throughout the process of investigating Ford's claims, Senate Republicans have requested evidence that has been referred to in media reports and testimony that could shed more light on what did, or did not, happen between Kavanaugh and Ford at a house party in 1982.
“Your continued withholding of material evidence despite multiple requests is unacceptable as the Senate exercises its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent for a judicial nomination,” Grassley wrote. “I urge you to comply promptly with my requests.""
What evidence is he talking about?Grassley is referring specifically to therapist notes that have been referenced in the media and spoken about during Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ford allegedly told her therapist in 2012 about being sexually assaulted, although those notes do not name Kavanaugh.
“First, I renew my request for the notes from therapy sessions in which Dr. Ford discussed the alleged assault by Judge Kavanaugh,” Grassley wrote. “The Washington Post reported that some notes were provided to The Post, and Dr. Ford’s testimony indicated that these notes were highly relevant to her allegation.""
The letter also calls for any audio or video recording of Ford's polygraph test, which she took in August. There was a notable exchange between Ford and Rachel Mitchell, the outside Arizona prosecutor hired by the GOP to question her, in which Ford eventually admitted that she assumed her polygraph session was recorded.
“It’s unfair to rely on the results of a polygraph examination while withholding the materials necessary to assess the accuracy of the results,” Grassley wrote.
Grassley referenced sworn testimony from a former boyfriend of Ford's who said he saw Ford coaching a friend on taking a polygraph exam. Fox News obtained a copy of a letter from an anonymous person claiming to be Ford's ex-boyfriend. A key passage:
Ford testified under oath during the Judiciary Committee hearing that she had never helped anyone who was planning to take a polygraph.

Grassley also asked for any other communications that Ford may have had with media, particularly since Ford referenced continuing a conversation with a reporter via WhatsApp, although those messages have not been seen.
Why don't they have that stuff already?Ford's legal representation has maintained that the therapist notes ""contain private, highly sensitive information that is not necessary for the Committee to assess the credibility of [Dr. Ford’s] testimony.""
Grassley disagrees.
“That the Senate is not a court of law does not change the reality that Dr. Ford’s allegations have put Judge Kavanaugh on trial before the nation,” Grassley wrote. “A sitting federal judge and Supreme Court nominee has been accused of committing a violent crime.”
“If it is necessary to protect certain records from public disclosure, then I’m happy to discuss how to achieve that goal.""

        Sen. Chuck Grassley chastises Democratic senator for forwarding outlandish Kavanaugh allegation
    Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is trying to be thorough by investigating sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But he has limits.
Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) apparently crossed that line with the latest allegation he sent to Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“We’ve reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation,” Grassley wrote in his response to Coons. “There is no evidence that Judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or had anything to do with it at all.""
What was in the letter?Coons received an email from a man named Tad Low, who claimed to have some information that could relate to Kavanaugh. Low said he attended Yale while Kavanaugh was in law school.
Low said he attended a party at a house owned by the fraternity of which Kavanaugh was a member, and witnessed some particularly inappropriate behavior involving some fraternity members and a local prostitute. The party allegedly occurred during the 1987-88 academic year.
Problem is, Low doesn't even know whether Kavanaugh was at the party. He's just asking the Senate Judiciary Committee to get more of Kavanaugh's calendars to see if he listed a party during that time frame.
Not mad, just disappointedThis totally unfounded shot in the dark caused Grassley to be disappointed that Coons would even waste his or Senate staff's time.
“I appreciate that you’ve handled yourself with the seriousness befitting a U.S. Senator throughout such of this nomination process,” Grassley wrote. “That’s why I was disappointed when you forwarded me allegations relating to Judge Kavanaugh’s ‘years in New Haven.'""
Grassley suggested Coons apply a little more scrutiny to information he receives before he sends it off for the committee to investigate.
“My investigators have serious work to do,” Grassley said. “While the Minority has refused to engage with the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way, my investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead.
“I therefore hope that, before forwarding an allegation in the future, you will first consider whether you’d want you or your staff to spend valuable time investigating it. Thanks for your consideration,” Grassley concluded.

        Two major developments in the FBI's 'supplemental' investigation into Brett Kavanaugh
    The FBI initiated its ""supplemental"" investigation into the background of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh almost immediately after President Donald Trump requested the probe on Friday.
Now, there have been two major updates stemming from the bureau's investigation.
1. The FBI has reached out to another Kavanaugh accuserAccording to the Washington Post, the FBI has reached out to accuser Deborah Ramirez for an interview. Ramirez alleged in a bombshell New Yorker story that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a party at Yale College. Both Ramirez and Kavanaugh attended Yale. Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh was heavily intoxicated during the incident.
John Clune, the attorney representing Ramirez, said: ""She has agreed to cooperate with their investigation. Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.""
Kavanaugh, just as he does with Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, vehemently denies Ramirez's allegations.
It's not clear who else the FBI has reached out to. However, people who know both Ford and Kavanaugh predict the FBI will uncover ugly details about the lives of people who know each individual.
According to the Post, the FBI has yet to reach out to a third Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnik.
Two of the people who Ford alleges were at the party where she says Kavanaugh assaulted her — Leland Keyser and Mark Judge — have expressed willingness to cooperate with the FBI's investigation.
2. The White House has limited the scope of the investigationAccording to NBC News, the White House has limited the number of individuals the FBI can interview as part of its probe. The White House counsel's office reportedly handed the FBI a specific list of individuals. Absent from that list is Swetnik.
However, the White House denied ""micromanaging"" the FBI's investigation. 
""The White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do,"" White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said, adding ""the scope and duration has been set by the Senate.""
More from NBC News:
A U.S. official briefed on the matter said its not unusual for the White House to set the parameters of an FBI background check for a presidential nominee. The FBI had no choice but to agree to these terms, the sources told NBC News, because it is conducting the background investigation on behalf of the White House.
If the FBI learns of others who can corroborate what the existing witnesses are saying, it is not clear whether agents will be able to contact them under the terms laid out by the White House, the two sources briefed on the matter said.What happens next?As the Washington Post explained, the FBI's findings will not likely become public. After investigators conclude their probe, they will turn over all relevant information to the White House, where it will be added to Kavanaugh's background information file. The White House will then share new information with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It's only at that point will each U.S. senator have access to the file.
However, it's the White House that has final say over what is publicly released and what remains sealed.
But there's one caveat: The FBI is not coming to a conclusion or recommending a path forward. They are only gathering information from individuals involved and potential witnesses, recording that information, and turning it over to the White House.

        WATCH: Lindsey Graham goes scorched earth on NBC for leading the 'destruction of Kavanaugh
    South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R), who last week became the face of the pro-Brett Kavanaugh movement after a fiery outburst in the Senate, went scorched earth on the mainstream media Monday.
In fact, Graham made it clear he believes there’s a conspiracy to undermine Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination — and he charged that NBC News is leading the angry mob.
What did he say?Graham's comments, which came during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, were prompted by an interview the third Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnick, gave to MSNBC on Monday. In that interview, Swetnick walked back some of her previous allegations and slightly altered her story.
""Why does NBC run this?"" Hannity asked Graham emphatically.
""Well, NBC, here's the biggest offense to me, they've been a co-conspirator in the destruction of Kavanaugh, from my point of view,"" Graham responded.
Graham ripped NBC News for reporting last week that the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Kavanaugh about a fourth accuser. That accuser wrote an anonymous letter to Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) alleging Kavanaugh physically assaulted a woman at a Colorado restaurant in 1998. The claim was completely unsubstantiated, yet it was still leaked to the media. It even appeared on ""NBC Nightly News.""
""Do you think NBC would’ve done that if this had been a Democratic male nominee? All I can say is that there the journalistic integrity has been destroyed over this case, regarding this case,"" Graham said.
The South Carolina lawmaker went on to predict that Kavanaugh will be confirmed because the FBI's supplemental investigation will not discover new details about Kavanaugh's background.

        NBC stealth edits Kavanaugh story after omitting judge's answer that undermined their argument
    NBC News published an article attempting to show that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had lied under oath during his testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, the original version of the article ignored part of the transcript from Kavanaugh's hearing that contradicted their allegations of lying. 
The network would later edit its initial story to include the missing text. While the dateline for the story noted that it was ""Updated Oct.02.2018,"" there was no indication regarding what had been updated, nor was there an editor's note in the story itself indicating a change. And even the updated story ignored a crucial part of Kavanaugh's testimony that undermined NBC's claim.
What was Kavanaugh's testimony about?On Sept. 23, The New Yorker ran a story publicizing allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh from Deborah Ramirez. Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were both attending Yale.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh was asked about these accusations, as well as accusations brought against him by other women.
What was NBC's original argument?The original NBC article, which was published Monday, focused on the following portion of Kavanaugh's questioning during Judiciary Committee hearing regarding the Ramirez story, the transcript of which is available online:
Judge Kavanaugh: No.NBC contrasted this with texts between Kerry Berchem and Karen Yarasavage, friends of Kavanaugh. These texts reportedly prove that Kavanaugh was aware of Ramirez's accusations before the New Yorker article came out.
Berchem told NBC News that while she had ""no direct or indirect knowledge about any of the allegations against him,"" she believes that the text messages are relevant to the investigation. Berchem attests that Kavanaugh  “and/or” his friends “may have initiated an anticipatory narrative” as far back as July to “conceal or discredit” Ramirez's story.
Texts by Yarasavage showed that Kavanaugh had asked her if she could come forward and deny the Ramirez accusations when they went public.
Berchem has sent a memo and screenshots detailing the texts to the FBI.
Based on solely the portion of the transcript included above, this would indeed contradict Kavanaugh's testimony. However, there is more to the official Senate transcript.
What did the updated story say?During the same round of questioning, Kavanaugh mentioned that he was aware that Ramirez was calling classmates to see if they could corroborate her story.
Judge Kavanaugh: That’s what I read in the New York  Times.
[REDACTED]: What’s your reaction to that?
Judge Kavanaugh: They couldn’t — the New York Times couldn’t corroborate this story and found that she was calling around to classmates trying to see if they remembered it. And I, at least — and I, myself, heard about that, that she was doing that [emphasis added]. And you know, that just strikes me as, you know, what is going on here? When someone is calling around to try to refresh other people, is that what’s going on? What’s going on with that? That doesn’t sound — that doesn’t sound good to me. It doesn’t sound fair. It doesn’t sound proper. It sounds like an orchestrated hit to take me out. That’s what it sounds like.This portion of the hearing was not mentioned in the original NBC article, but much of it is in the updated version. The article now includes the following new text:

This update, however, still leaves out a crucial line: The one where Kavanaugh mentions that he had heard that Ramirez was calling up classmates and asking them if they could back up her story before the story itself was published. In fact, NBC uses quotes from each side of this line while omitting it entirely.
So not only did NBC stealth-edit in Kavanaugh's Sept 25th testimony, they cut the quote in a way that *specifically omits* his testimony he knew about the Ramirez allegation in the days beforehand pic.twitter.com/cbphtjB4YL— Alex ""Squee"" Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) October 2, 2018CNN's Jake Tapper also pointed out on Twitter that Kavanaugh is quoted in the original New Yorker story, so it's easy to determine that he would have known about the New Yorker story was likely coming before it was published on Sept. 23.
Kavanaugh is quoted in the New Yorker story denying the allegation so of course he had heard about it prior to publication. https://t.co/oVWmyC3lcv— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 2, 2018National Review's Charles C. W. Cooke argued that the words “incident matching the description” could indicate that Kavanaugh may have known that accusations were forthcoming without knowing the specific details of them.
A spokesman for Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told NBC News that “the texts from Ms. Berchem do not appear relevant or contradictory to Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony.""
Of course, what Kavanaugh did or did not know at the time is difficult or impossible to prove without further evidence. But if NBC has such evidence, they did not present it in this article. They also failed to clearly note how the article had been updated.
What else?NBC is not the first news outlet to significantly edit a Kavanaugh story. On Sept. 23 and 24, the New York Times published stories that noted that it was unable to confirm Ramirez's account as presented in The New Yorker. This admission was later edited out of the Sept. 24 story. Despite the reporter's insistence that this portion of the story had never been there in the first place, TheBlaze was able to retrieve earlier copies of the story which included this admission.

        Liberal celebrities plan star-studded anti-Brett Kavanaugh protest for Thursday in DC
    Outspoken liberal entertainers like Lena Dunham and Whoopi Goldberg plan to storm Washington, D.C., Thursday in protest of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, USA Today reported.
What are the details?The #CancelKavanaugh protest is scheduled at 12:30 p.m. Thursday outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse — just a few blocks from the Capitol.
Party Majority PAC is sponsoring the event, and a description for the event states, ""If there was ever a moment when the voice of the people can come together in concert to change the fate of our nation, this is it. Arm in arm, organized and ready, every child, woman, and man must take to the streets to protest this nomination.""
The PAC added, ""We anticipate a vote on the Senate floor to confirm Brett Kavanaugh as early as Friday. It is critical we make our voices heard on the ground in Washington on Thursday.""
Those on board for the protest include Dunham, Goldberg, Amy Schumer, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and more.
USA Today reported that liberal celebrity activists will deliver speeches and performances in person, while other entertainers — who will not be able to make the D.C. gathering — will walk off their jobs on Thursday at 12:30 p.m. in solidarity.
Anything else?During Christine Blasey Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, she said that she suffered a sexual assault at the hands of Kavanaugh during a high school party in 1982.
Kavanaugh categorically denied these allegations during his own testimony last Thursday.
The Judiciary Committee voted Friday to send the Kavanaugh nomination to full Senate. Committee members asked that the FBI conduct a one-week investigation into Ford’s accusations.

        Kavanaugh accuser involved in other legal disputes, faced sexual misconduct allegations against her
    Julie Swetnick, one of the women who has publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, has “an extensive history of involvement in legal disputes,"" the Associated Press reported.
What are the allegations?One lawsuit alleges that 18 years ago, while she worked at the Portland tech company Webtrends, Swetnik ""engaged in unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct"" and ""made false and retaliatory allegations that other co-workers had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward her,"" the Oregonian reported.
Webtrends also alleged that she falsified her college and work history on her job application, according to reports.
The Associated Press reported it reviewed court records that show Swetnick was involved in at least six legal cases over the past 25 years. In one example, Swetnick filed a personal injury suit against the Washington, D.C. transit authority in 1994.
Swetnick's personal injury lawsuit against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in Maryland claimed she ""lost more than $420,000 in earnings after she hurt her nose in a fall on a train in 1992,"" the report states.
In court records, Swetnick, described herself as a model and actor. She also said she had “numerous modeling commitments” with several companies she couldn't do because of the accident, the report states.
Swetnick’s lawsuit against the transit agency was dismissed in 1997, following a settlement, the Associated Press reported.
Swetnick’s attorney Michael Avenatti, told the Associated Press the previous court cases are not relevant do not reduce the credibility of her claims against Kavanaugh. He said the suit by the ex-employer, for example, was dismissed “almost immediately.”
Avenatti is a strong critic of President Donald Trump and represents Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who claims to have had an affair with the president before he took office.

""In the suit, Webtrends alleged Swetnick threatened legal action against the company over her own harassment claims,"" The Oregonian reported. ""The lawsuit claimed that act defamed the business and sought at least $150,000 on behalf of an employee that Swetnick had allegedly made false statements about.""
Avenatti told the news outlet he ""fully vetted” Swetnick before helping her go public with her claims against Kavanaugh.
He released a sworn statement by Swetnick that alleges she saw Kavanaugh “consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s.”
The statement also says Swetnick was sexually assaulted at a party attended by some of Kavanaugh’s acquaintances. She did not accuse Kavanaugh of assaulted her in the statement, which was given to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Anything else?Two other women have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
College professor Christine Blasey Ford testified against Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Some of Kavanaugh’s strongest supporters, including Trump, have called her credible.
Deborah Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a wild party while they were students at Yale University. Ramirez’s friends and colleagues described her as a quiet person who advocates for needy families and domestic violence victims, according to the report.
Kavanaugh has denied all of the claims, and called some of the allegations a “joke” and a “farce.”
Meanwhile, Trump has ordered the FBI to conduct an updated background check on Kavanaugh. The investigation is expected to be completed within one week.

        Sen. Mitch McConnell promises that vote on Brett Kavanaugh will take place this week
    Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) promised Tuesday that the Senate would vote on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be a justice on the Supreme Court by the end of the week.
What did McConnell say?During a speech on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, McConnell said firmly: “One thing we know for sure: The Senate will vote on Judge Kavanaugh here on this floor, this week.”
McConnell criticized Democrats for their demands to expand the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, accusing them of constantly trying to “move the goalposts.” McConnell argued that his Democratic colleagues would “not be satisfied unless they have brought down Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.”

In a similar speech on the Senate floor Monday, McConnell speculated that if he gave into Democratic demands on this point, there would be no end to what they demanded next:
What about the FBI investigation?The FBI has been conducting an additional investigation into Kavanaugh since the Senate Judiciary Committee wrapped up a series of hearings on Friday. This investigation was a concession that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) gave to Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Flake said that the investigation would ease his conscience before he voted to confirm Kavanaugh.
Republicans have insisted that this investigation be limited to a single week, noting that the FBI had already conducted a background investigation into Kavanaugh and referred their findings to the White House. Democrats have argued that the time limit could prevent the FBI from conducting a thorough investigation into accusations of sexual misconduct that have been leveled against Kavanaugh.
McConnell tweeted that ""[s]enators will have the opportunity to vote"" as soon as ""the FBI shares what they've found.""

What else?McConnell also dismissed reports that Kavanaugh had been in a bar fight during his college days.
“One can only imagine what new bombshell might be published today or tomorrow,” he scoffed.

        Senate Judiciary Committee refers 'false statements' against Brett Kavanaugh to FBI
    The Senate Judiciary Committee on Saturday asked the FBI to investigate a person who allegedly gave ""false statements"" to the committee alleging ""misconduct"" by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 
What are the details?According to a letter Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Rhode Island man contacted Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D) on Sept. 24 claiming to possess new allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh.
The man claimed Kavanaugh assaulted a woman in August 1985 on a boat in the Newport harbor. Grassley said the committee took the allegations seriously, and questioned Kavanaugh about them on Sept. 25. Of course, Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Then, after the allegations were made public, the man who reported them recanted his story via social media on Sept. 26. The tomfoolery diverted valuable committee resources and slowed the process of Kavanaugh's confirmation, Grassley said.
Grassley said the man's actions were potentially illegal.
""The Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know. But when individuals provide fabricated allegations to the Committee, diverting Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations, it materially impedes our work,"" Grassley said.
""Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal. It is illegal to make materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements to Congressional investigators. It is illegal to obstruct Committee investigations,"" he added.
The identity of the man who provided the false claims is not clear. The man's name was redacted from Grassley's letter.
Why is this significant?Kavanaugh vehemently denies each allegation against him. Attached to Grassley's letter was a transcript detailing Kavanaugh's denials when questioned about the additional allegations last Tuesday. The revelation that one of the allegations was fabricated adds casts additional doubt on the other allegations. While we may never know for sure, it's easier to doubt the allegations when others have certainly been pulled out of thin air.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/17/democratic-senator-we-must-listen-to-sexual-assault-victims-then-clinton-rape-accuser-speaks-up","
        Democratic senator: We must 'listen' to sexual assault victims. Then Clinton rape accuser speaks up.
    Amid a woman's allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh groped her when they were teenagers more than 35 years ago, Democrats are jumping on the development and saying the judge's confirmation vote should be delayed pending a full investigation.
Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin was among them:

The Illinois lawmaker added a familiar declaration that we all must ""listen"" to sexual assault survivors — and ""regardless of the age of those involved or when the alleged attack took place.""

Well, one woman — who for many years has been issuing a sexual assault allegation against former President Bill Clinton — took Durbin at his word:

When #MeToo works against the leftDemocrats and those of their ilk sometimes have a tough time getting riled up when one of their own is accused of sexual assault — and that's been painfully true when it comes to Clinton, whom Broaddrick accused of raping her when he was attorney general of Arkansas.
Hillary Clinton herself dismissed Broaddrick's claims — as well as those of Kathleen Wiley and Paula Jones — against her husband, saying there were ""clearly in the past.”
In addition, then-CBS News anchor Dan Rather offered the following thoughts to radio host Don Imus in 1999 about why NBC News may have been declining to air a Broaddrick interview on the subject:
When Imus said he'd heard Broaddrick had hoped her story ""went away this week,"" Rather replied, ""Well, let's hope she gets her way with that.""
Interestingly, Rather — who stepped down at CBS News after his 2004 report on President George W. Bush’s national guard service used documents that weren’t verified as authentic — hasn't yet weighed in on the Kavanaugh controversy. But he did tweet a link to an article sympathetic to Kavanaugh's accuser, saying the piece offers ""very important context and perspective.""

        Kellyanne Conway defends Kavanaugh, reveals she has been a victim of sexual assault
    White House counselor Kellyanne Conway defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday, and also revealed that she has been a victim of sexual assault.
“I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault, sexual harassment and rape,” Conway said CNN. “I’m a victim of sexual assault.”
She said the debate over Kavanaugh is not a “meeting of the Me Too movement.” She was referring to the movement that began a year ago and has seen multiple women level sexual misconduct accusations against men in high-profile positions of power in politics, media, and other fields.
“Let's not compare Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, and a few others, to what's happened here,” Conway said. “If we're going to have a national conversation, stop judging the victims and perpetrators according to their politics.”
Conway said she has ""just had it"" with people saying it's all the same.
Should victims be heard?“They should all be heard."" Conway told CNN host Jake Tapper. ""And they should be heard in courts of law. They should be heard in depositions. They should be heard in proceedings. Those who can prosecute, those who have civil and or criminal causes of action should pursue that.""
“But we do treat people differently – who are either the victims or the perpetrators of this - based on the politics…based on their gender. And that’s a huge mistake,"" she added.
Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump and his confirmation vote is awaiting the outcome of a FBI investigation into allegations that he assaulted at least one woman in the early 1980s.
Last week, college professor Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and alleged that Kavanaugh held her down, covered her mouth, and attempted to remove her clothing without consent. At the time, they were both in high school.
The FBI is reportedly investigating allegations by at least one other women.
What did she say about Trump?Conway also said Trump should not be brought “into everything.” He has also faced accusations of sexual misconduct.
“People on Twitter and elsewhere are saying right now, ‘oh how can she work for Donald Trump?’ I work for President Trump because he’s so good to the woman who work for him,” she said. “I don’t want to hear it from anybody.”

        Sen. Hirono deflects question on whether Democrats leaked accuser's letter about Kavanaugh
    Sen. Mazie Hirono deflected a question Sunday about whether she believes Democrats did not strategically leak Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Hirono, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, is one of Kavanaugh’s biggest critics.
What happened?On ABC's ""This Week,"" host George Stephanopoulos asked Hirono: ""Are you confident the Democrats didn’t leak that letter, and how do you respond to Senator [Lindsey] Graham’s charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer Dr. Blasey Ford to a lawyer?""
Hirono responded: ""All of these things do not focus on what we should be focusing, which is the credibility of Judge Kavanaugh.""
She also said claims of a conspiracy against him are bizarre.
""And, by the way, even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated are being tossed around, everyone acknowledges, including Judge Kavanaugh, that Dr. Ford is not being politically motivated,"" Hirono said. ""That is very clear.""
In July, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) received a letter from Kavanaugh’s key accuser, Ford, that alleged he attacked her at a house party in the 1980s. Feinstein’s office immediately recommended Ford retain a prominent liberal lawyer, according to reports.
Hirono’s “non-answer” could be used by Republicans who are seeking answers on how Blasey Ford’s letter wound up at the The Intercept news outlet, Fox News reported.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and others have suggested the move was orchestrated by Democrats.
During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday, Feinstein was questioned about but denied leaking the letter.
""Well, I'm telling you I did not,"" Feinstein said.
She also said: ""It's my understanding that [Ford's] story was leaked before the letter became public and she testified that she had spoken to her friends about it, and it's most likely that that's how this story leaked ... But it did not leak from us, I assure you that.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republicans said last week that Feinstein did not follow committee protocols when she received the information. That includes notifying her colleagues or federal authorities about the accusations, even if they were to be kept confidential.
What's next?The FBI already did a background check but is now investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh. The agency's report is due Friday. President Donald Trump has said the FBI is free to interview anyone it sees fit.
Hirono has suggested the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh should not be limited to a week.

        ND-Sen: Amid the Kavanaugh conundrum, new poll shows Kevin Cramer with massive lead over Heitkamp
    North Dakota's at-large congressman, Rep. Kevin Cramer (R), has a commanding lead over his opponent, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D), in the fight for North Dakota's U.S. Senate seat, a new poll reveals.
The poll results, which come amid the partisan fight to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, underscore the magnitude of judicial nominations in the Trump-era while revealing just how crucial Kavanaugh's nomination is to vulnerable lawmakers.
The poll also shows that Democrats are faced with an impasse: Either allow vulnerable red-state Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh or risk their chance at regaining control of the Senate.
What does the poll show?The poll, conducted by Strategic Research Associates and KFYR-TV, shows Cramer with a commanding 10-point lead in the crucial race. Among likely voters, the survey found that 51 percent back Cramer while just 41 percent back Heitkamp. The remaining 8 percent were undecided.
The poll was conducted after numerous allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh surfaced, but was completed before last Thursday's controversial hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Concerning Kavanaugh, 60 percent of the 650 respondents voiced their support for his nomination. Just 27 percent said they oppose it while the remaining respondents were undecided.
Meanwhile, 21 percent of respondents cited Kavanaugh as the midterms most crucial issue. He beat out health care, border security, the economy, and national security.
What's Heitkamp's position on Kavanaugh?She has remained quiet about Kavanaugh and the allegations against him — an intentional strategy knowing she's facing a tough re-election battle.
After Kavanaugh's hearing before the Judiciary Committee last week, Heitkamp said she remains undecided. However, she said she's in the ""final stages"" of making her decision.
""This isn’t an easy decision. And honestly, I don’t think it should be easy for anyone,"" she said, according to the West Fargo Pioneer.
Heitkamp was one of three Democratic senators to support Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court nominee.
Meanwhile, the conservative leaning Judicial Crisis Network is pressuring Heitkamp, along with moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), to vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination with a new series of ads.

        Man claims Kavanaugh threw beer in man's face during bar fight. Then the police report is released.
    First it was three allegations of sexual assault. Then, on Sunday, media were alerted to an altercation at a Connecticut bar involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 1985.
Though the incident happened more than three decades ago, the allegation helped anti-Kavanaugh factions paint him as an alcoholic who lacks the judicial temperament appropriate for a lifetime appointment to the high court.
Then journalists received a copy of the police report detailing what actually happened at that New Haven bar in 1985.
What are the details?Chad Ludington, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh and now works as a history professor at North Carolina State University, released a statement Sunday accusing Kavanaugh of being dishonest about his past with alcohol.
Ludington claimed Kavanaugh became ""often belligerent and aggressive"" when he drank. Then Ludington said: ""On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man’s face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail.""
It was that claim that drew attention from journalists. On Monday, the New York Times obtained the police report detailing the incident, which occurred in September 1985, when Kavanaugh was a junior at Yale.
What did the police report say?The police report does not state that Kavanaugh initiated a fight, was engaged in a fight, or threw beer during a bar altercation. Instead, the police report shows that Kavanaugh and four others were questioned by police — but not arrested.
In fact, regarding Kavanaugh, the police report shows that a 21-year-old man alleged to police that Kavanaugh threw ice on him ""for some unknown reason.""
According to the police report, Chris Dudley, one of Kavanaugh's friends, threw a glass at a man, hitting him in the ear, which caused his right ear to bleed. That man was treated for his injuries at the local hospital. The report shows that Dudley denied being involved, as did Kavanaugh.
There is no indication that police filed charges or arrested anyone.
How did the White House respond?The White House did not offer an official response to the story. However, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, tweeting from her official account, characterized the story as another desperate attack by Democrats on Kavanaugh.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/28/christine-blasey-fords-lawyer-is-unhappy-with-the-fbi-investigation-into-kavanaugh-heres-why","
        Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer is unhappy with the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh -- here's why
    Christine Blasey Ford, her attorneys, and the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee fought hard for an additional FBI investigation into Ford's allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.
Friday, they got what they were asking for. By the end of Friday, however, that was no longer good enough.
Debra Katz, one of Ford's attorneys, released a statement decrying the fact that President Donald Trump authorized a ""limited"" FBI investigation.
""A thorough FBI investigation is critical to developing all the relevant facts,” Katz said in her statement. “Dr. Christine Blasey Ford welcomes this step in the process, and appreciates the efforts of Senators Flake, Murkowski, Manchin and Collins — and all other senators who have supported an FBI investigation — to ensure it is completed before the Senate votes on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. No artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation.""

What does she mean?Trump authorized the FBI to take no more than a week to investigate Ford's allegation, in the interest of not holding up a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination any longer than necessary.
Katz believes the FBI should be able to take as much time as it needs, and should be able to expand the investigation as wide as it sees fit -- which could include looking into allegations made by other women.
For Democrats, who have shown a desire to stall in order to push a vote on Trump's nominee past midterm elections, an unlimited investigation would make it relatively easy to potentially delay a confirmation vote for months, with the hope that they take back the Senate.
Democrats are still accusing Republicans of trying to rush a vote and claiming more time is needed to investigate Ford's allegations, despite the fact that Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) held on to Ford's allegation for more than a month before the Senate Judiciary Committee found out about it.

        Amid Kavanaugh drinking controversy, video of Obama admitting heavy drinking, drug abuse resurfaces
    A video featuring former President Barack Obama when he was an Illinois state senator has resurfaced, and in the 2001 video for The History Makers, he was asked what he was like as a child and adolescent.
The video has regained national attention as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been under fire since the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last Thursday when he denied allegations that he'd sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were at a house party in 1982.
Kavanaugh, during his testimony, admitted that he liked to drink beer while in high school, and sometimes that he drank ""too many beers,"" but categorically denied all claims of sexual misconduct.
What are the details of this video?In the Obama video, the former president's remarks will sound familiar to many Americans.
""What was the young Barack like?"" the interviewer asked Obama at one point in the clip.
Obama responded by telling her that he believed he was a ""thug"" for a large part of his childhood.
""I think I was a thug for a big part of my growing up. I think I was a very typical gregarious, mischievous child as a young boy,"" Obama admitted. ""I think by the time I was an adolescent, and had moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues of racial identity and a father not being in the house, I think that I reacted by engaging in a lot of behavior that's not untypical of black males across the country.""
He continued, ""I played a lot of basketball, I didn't take school that seriously, I got into fights, I drank and consumed substances that weren't always legal, and you know, I think generally was acting out in ways that, when I look back on it, I understand.""
Obama added that what he believed helped him pull through some more difficult years was his natural ability to do well in school without much effort.
""I think that what got me through those years was sort of a natural aptitude for schooling, which meant that I didn't have to pay attention too much to be able to keep my grades up,"" he added. ""[Or] at least graduate. Some of my behavior was self-destructive. I might drink a six-pack in an hour before going back to class, things like that.""
You can watch the clip in its entirety below.

        Montgomery County PD explains why no charges were ever filed against Brett Kavanaugh
    The Montgomery County Police Department and Montgomery County State’s Attorney's Office explained in a letter Friday why no criminal charges were ever brought against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
And the reason is?No victim has come forward to file a police report, the agencies stated.
“To date, there have been no criminal reports filed with the Montgomery County Department of Police that would lead to the initiation of any criminal investigation related to Judge Kavanaugh,” a report by WBFF-TV stated.
What is the statute of limitations?The letter also addressed the statute of limitations for sexual assault, a key part of the Kavanaugh debate.
Police said they believe that laws on the books at the time of the offense would apply to any charges that might result from a criminal investigation.
“For example, in 1982, assault and attempted rape were both misdemeanors and subject to a one-year statute of limitations,” the letter stated.
The letter came in response to a Maryland delegate’s call to open a criminal case against Kavanaugh, according to the TV station.
A vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was delayed by allegations from professor Christine Blasey Ford. She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week and alleges that Kavanaugh assaulted her in the early 1980s. At the time, they were both high school students in Montgomery County, Maryland.
Kavanaugh vehemently denies the allegation.
Montgomery County police stated that they and the Montgomery County State’s Attorney's Office are prepared to investigate any allegation if a victim does come forward.
According to police, the department would investigate an allegation and turn the results over to the Montgomery County State’s Attorney Office.
The Attorney’s Office would then determine if the case could be prosecuted, the police department stated.
Following hearings before the Senate committee this week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) requested a one-week delay. The time frame was set so the FBI can investigate the accusations before the full Senate holds a votes on Kavanaugh's confirmation. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to reopen a background investigation on Kavanaugh, his choice for the seat vacated by the retirement of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.

        Christine Ford's friend who was allegedly at party where Kavanaugh assault occurred speaks out
    The woman who Christine Blasey Ford says attended the same party where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her in the summer of 1982 spoke out Saturday morning.
What did she say?Speaking through her attorney, Leland Keyser, who remains a close friend to Ford, said she is willing to ""cooperate fully"" with the FBI's supplemental investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
But as Keyser revealed last weekend, she has no recollection of the events Ford alleges.
""As my client has already made clear, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford,"" Keyser's attorney said.
""Notably, Ms. Keyser does not refute Dr. Ford's account, and she has already told the press that she believes Dr. Ford's account. However, the simple and unchangeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate it because she has no recollection of the incident in question,"" the lawyer explained.
The statement mirrored one her attorney, Howard Walsh, provided media last week. Walsh said: ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.""
However, Keyser later told the Washington Post that, despite being unable to corroborate Ford's allegations, she believes her friend.
Why is Keyser's statement significant?It shows that alleged witnesses remain unable to corroborate any of Ford's accusations, despite the exhausting coverage of the accusations and this week's hearing.
As the prosecutor who questioned Ford and Kavanaugh, Rachel Mitchell, admitted, the evidence against Kavanaugh, which is next to none, is not enough for prosecution, let alone an arrest or search warrant.

        Bernie Sanders requests another Kavanaugh investigation. Grassley destroys him with epic statement.
    Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) postured Saturday when he wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asking the FBI to probe the truthfulness of answers Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's gave during last Thursday's emotional hearing.
""In order for the FBI investigation regarding Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to be complete, it is imperative the bureau must not only look into the accusations made by Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, it should also examine the veracity of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee,"" Sanders wrote.
Noting that lying to Congress is a crime, Sanders outlined nine specific instances he believes should be investigated, including five from Kavanaugh's earlier Senate confirmations in 2004 and 2006, and four from Kavanaugh's testimony last week. Each of Sanders' requests stem from unsubstantiated claims.
Grassley responded to Sanders' letter late Saturday night, putting the very obvious political ploy to bed.
What did Grassley say?The longtime Iowa lawmaker came out swinging. He began his response by noting that on July 10, less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced Kavanaugh's nomination, Sanders publicly remarked, ""[w]e must mobilize the American people to defeat"" Kavanaugh.
Reminding Sanders that all senators have had access to 307 Kavanaugh court decisions, over 500,000 documents, over 40 hours of live testimony, and ""more answers to written questions than every prior Supreme Court nominee combined,"" he condemned Sanders for his rush to judgement.
""Nevertheless, you made your decision on this nomination in less than 24 hours,"" Grassley wrote.
He added:
Your public statements clearly reveal how unimportant it is to you to review any facts related to this  nomination. So you can imagine my surprise at receiving your letter regarding the supplemental FBI background investigation. This supplemental FBI background investigation was requested by undecided members of both parties. Am I to take from your letter that you are now undecided and seriously willing to engage with the Senate’s advice-and-consent constitutional duties related to the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States? If so, we should have a conversation about what information you need to assist you in making your decision, and I look forward to that conversation.Grassley concluded the letter with a thunderous one-liner.
""I appreciate your raising concerns, which others have already raised, at this 11th hour,"" he wrote.

        In emotional testimony, Kavanaugh calls confirmation process a 'national disgrace
    Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh abandoned his prepared remarks in favor of more extensive ones he had written “yesterday afternoon and evening.” These new remarks, he said, nobody had seen except for a former law clerk.
What were Kavanaugh's emotions?As he started his testimony, Kavanaugh alternated between rage and tears.
Kavanaugh called the confirmation process a “national disgrace” and stated unequivocally “I was not at the party described by Dr. Ford.”
Kavanaugh defending himself and attacking the democrats on the committee: ""This confirmation process has become a national disgrace."" pic.twitter.com/SeLaqK45EE— Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 27, 2018Kavanaugh sharply criticized Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), although not by name, for saying that those who supported Kavanaugh were “complicit in the evil.”
Given comments like those is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family. To send any violent email to my wife. To make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends. To blow me up and take me down. You sowed the wind for decades to come, I feel that the whole country will reap the whirlwind.He also talked about the impact these accusations and their media coverage have had on his family:
What about Kavanaugh's drinking?Kavanaugh emphatically insisted that while he did drink beer in high school, and sometimes “too many beers,” he never did so to the point of blacking out. He also said he has “never sexually assaulted anyone.”

        Top House Dem vows to initiate probe into 'credible' Kavanaugh allegations if Dems retake House
    The House Judiciary Committee will investigate Judge Brett Kavanaugh if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court and Democrats regain a majority in the House after November's midterm elections, a top House Democrat vowed Sunday.
What did the Democrat say?New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D) would likely chair the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats retake the House, as he is already the committee's ranking member. He explained on ABC News' ""This Week"" that in the case of a Democratic majority in the House, he would use his newfound power to initiate another Kavanaugh investigation.
""If he is on the Supreme Court, and the Senate hasn't investigated, then the House will have to,"" Nadler said. ""We would have to investigate any credible allegations, certainly of perjury, and other things that haven't been properly looked into before.""
Nadler characterized the uncorroborated claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh as ""credible.""
Speaking to the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's background, Nadler said it would be ""a real problem"" if the probe isn't thorough and called on Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who prompted the investigation, to ensure the investigation is carried out with integrity.
""I would hope that Sen. Flake and others would make clear that their votes will not be for the nominee unless there is a free hand for a proper investigation of these very serious allegations of sexual assaults,"" Nadler said.
""We cannot have a justice on the Supreme Court for the next several decades who will be deciding questions of liberty and life and death...who has been credibly accused of sexual assaults, who has been credible accused of various other, um, uh, things — wrong things, including perjury,"" he explained.

Anything else?Kavanaugh vehemently denies all allegations of misconduct.
The FBI initiated a ""supplemental"" investigation of Kavanaugh's background on Friday. The investigation is only expected to last one week, but no new information is expected to be revealed. And even though Democrats hounded Kavanaugh to call for the investigation, those opposing his confirmation have already questioned the integrity of the probe.
Also, top Democrats have floated the possibility of impeaching Kavanaugh should he be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
However, Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor who questioned Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford during last week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a memo late Sunday detailing why no ""reasonable prosecutor"" would pursue the Kavanaugh case. In fact, she said the case is ""weaker"" than traditional ""he said, she said"" sex cases.

        NV-Sen: Heller still supports Kavanaugh, while Rosen says 'Believe women
    Republican Sen. Dean Heller, an early supporter of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, was not moved to change his stance by Thursday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Heller, who is in a difficult race against Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, Friday stated that he still supported Kavanaugh.
""It is my hope that after this additional week, other senators will come to the conclusion that I have reached and support Judge Kavanaugh's nomination,"" Heller said, according to the Reno Gazette Journal.
Why does he still support Kavanaugh?Heller said he found Christine Blasey Ford's testimony ""genuine"" and commended her for ""bravely sharing her painful story,"" but said the evidence to change his mind just wasn't there.
""However, no corroborating evidence to support the allegations surfaced during yesterday's hearing,"" Heller said in a statement. ""While I am extremely disappointed by the way that Democrats approached the allegations and by the resulting media circus that ensued, I am supportive of the administration's decision to request a supplemental FBI background investigation that must be completed one week from today.""
What does Rosen think?
Rosen, who was always against Kavanaugh's nomination like most Democrats, criticized Republicans for attempting to confirm Kavanaugh without an FBI investigation.
""After Dr. Ford's powerful testimony, it's unconscionable that a Senator could not have a single reservation about confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court without re-opening the FBI investigation,"" Rosen tweeted Thursday. ""Credible assault allegations should not be dismissed as 'a little hiccup.'""

Rosen was referring to Heller's comment that called the allegation a hiccup, which Heller later clarified.
The Democratic representative also attacked Heller for already having his mind made up about Kavanaugh before the hearing.
""Senator Heller watched Dr. Ford's testimony, but he had already made up his mind,"" Rosen wrote. ""He doesn't even care what the FBI might find in its supplemental investigation.""

Worth noting, at least one Democrat had apparently made up her mind before hearing from both Ford and Kavanaugh. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told Ford during Thursday's hearing that she believed her testimony, before Kavanaugh had even testified.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Friday to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate, which will have a final vote on it after the week-long FBI background investigation into Kavanaugh is complete.

        Anti-Kavanaugh Georgetown professor goes on vile Twitter rant
    I'm just going to jump right into this one. Georgetown University's distinguished associate professor C. Christine Fair, a professor of law, had an interesting tweet to share with us all.
Wow. That's pretty violent. Especially for someone who is verified. Her statements definitely seem to violate Twitter's terms of service, you know, for advocating violence.
RELATED: Overdramatic ""Handmaid's Tale"" protest disrespects actual oppression happening around the worldProfessor Fair's Twitter bio reads like postmodern satire:
Interestingly, she's worked at several places that have the word ""peace"" in their title. She doesn't really seem like the peaceful type.
""She also runs a blog called Sh*t Men Say where she doxxes people. It's about 'accountability,' she claims,"" the Independent Sentinel reports.
In response to the backlash that she'd received, she doubled down on her inflammatory rhetoric:
Nothing says stable like putting random words in all caps.
Then there's this gem, in which she rants about the patriarchy as if it actually exists:
As you would expect, she goes on these rants quite often. It's actually a wonder that she has any time to teach, with all the ranting she does.
Big surprise: She does not like Brett Kavanaugh, and she certainly does not like President Donald Trump. She typifies the utter insanity that has overtaken the left. No amount of evidence in favor of Kavanaugh could change her mind. Nothing can. She is possessed by an unending hatred and there's nothing that anyone can say or do to change that.
Let's just hope that her students can see through all that rage and hysteria. Otherwise, we could have a much bigger problem to deal with.

        Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge agrees to cooperate with FBI investigation if asked to do so
    Mark Judge, the high school friend of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who Christine Blasey Ford alleges was in the room when Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party in 1982, has agreed to testify before the FBI.
What are the details?Ford alleged that while Kavanaugh was trying to remove her clothes, Judge was in the room watching and laughing.  Judge and Kavanaugh have denied these accusations.
The Democrats failed to get Judge to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he has since agreed to answer questions from the FBI he is requested to do so.
""If the FBI or any law enforcement agency requests Mr. Judge's cooperation, he will answer any and all questions posed to him,"" Judge's lawyer Barbara Van Gelder told CNBC via email.
Earlier, in a signed letter presented to the Judiciary Committee, Judge wrote :
He has consistently refused to testify in a public setting, citing depression and anxiety he said he suffers as ""a recovering alcoholic and a cancer survivor.""
What FBI investigation?Earlier on Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee had voted 11 to 10 along party lines to recommend that the Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh.
Before this committee vote, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had asked Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to request a weeklong FBI investigation into allegations leveled against Kavanaugh. Grassley had agreed to relay the request, although the authority to authorize such an investigation rests with the executive branch, and not with the Senate.
The final decision on whether or not to conduct an investigation would rest with either the Justice Department or with President Donald Trump.
All the Senate has the authority to do is to delay the vote to give the FBI time to conduct such an investigation. Even then, that decision to delay rests with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), not with Grassley or any of the other Judiciary Committee members.

        NYT: Kavanaugh has calendars from 1982 that could negate assault allegations
    Brett Kavanaugh has located his personal calendars from the summer of 1982, and they could be used to exonerate him of accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford, the New York Times reported Sunday.
Kavanaugh plans to hand the documentation over to the Senate Judiciary Committee this week. 
What's on the calendars?The calendars reportedly do not list a party mentioned by Ford in her accusation. 
Kavanaugh’s team has admitted they do not disprove anything. For example, he could have attended a party that is not listed. But his team will argue to senators that they also offer no proof of her claim that he allegedly pinned her to a bed and attempted to remove her clothing, the report notes.
The New York Times stated it examined the calendar pages from June, July and August of 1982, which detail that Kavanaugh was for most of the summer either out of town, at the beach or away with his parents. Included on the calendars are “basketball games, movie outings, football workouts and college interviews.”
A few parties are listed but do not show names of friends mentioned by Blasey, the report stated.
Senators are trying to confirm or deny Blasey’s account of the alleged sexual assault. She has said she cannot recall the exact day or location, but believes it was in the summer of 1982. Blasey has also said she was wearing a bathing suit with other clothing on top of it. 
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.
Kavanaugh and Blasey are scheduled to testify before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, which is considering whether to endorse his Supreme Court nomination. The New York Times called it a “public test of credibility.”
Blasey’s sexual assault allegation is slowing down what was seemed to be a swift path to confirmation for Kavanaugh.
How old were they back then?At the time of the alleged assault, Blasey would have been 15 and Kavanaugh, 17.
Back then, Kavanaugh was a student at the all-boys Georgetown Preparatory School, and Blasey was attending the the all-girls Holton-Arms School. Students from the two private schools in the Maryland suburbs sometimes socialized together, the report notes.
Kavanaugh’s advisers have said Blasey's account of what happened will not be challenged, but they will argue it was not him, the report stated.

        Female prof says white GOP senators in Kavanaugh hearing ‘deserve miserable deaths’ in graphic rant
    A female professor at Georgetown University came under fire after saying that Republican senators involved in the Brett Kavanaugh hearing ""deserve miserable deaths"" and went on to detail what should be done with their corpses after such deaths.
What are the details?On Saturday, Georgetown University distinguished associate professor C. Christine Fair — who is politically outspoken on her Twitter feed — shared a video of Sen. Lindsey Graham speaking during Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on Thursday.
According to Fair's Twitter bio, the professor is a ""[s]cholar of South Asian pol-mil affairs, inter-sectional feminist, pitbull apostle, scotch devotee, nontheist, [and] resister.""
She wrote, ""Look at thus [sic] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist's arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps.""
She concluded the graphic tweet with ""Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.""
Look at thus chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist's arrogated entitlement.
All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes. https://t.co/tT7Igu157y— (((Christine Fair))) (@CChristineFair) September 29, 2018According to a Sunday post by Campus Reform, the professor responded to a request for comment in a very lengthy missive on her blog, ""Tenacious Hellp***y.""
In her extensive response, Fair wrote, ""There is a war going on against women and you, and your despicable herd of so-called journalists seeking to protect male privilege and shame women for our victimization or our rage are complicit in this war.""
Fair added that she was not calling for violence against any senators — she was ""merely speaking to what my spirituality says these vile souls deserve.""
Fair also detailed what she said was her own experience with sexual abuse, in which her uncle reportedly sexually abused her when she was in nursery school and only stopped when she was 13 years old.
Fair correlated this experience to the alleged experience of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford reportedly suffered at the hands of Kavanaugh during a high school party in the early '80s.
What else?Kavanaugh has categorically denied these allegations, and he and Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Not one of Kavanaugh's accusers have alleged that he committed rape.
The Senate Judiciary Committee held a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday, and decided to send the Kavanaugh vote to full Senate, asking that FBI conduct a one-week investigation into Ford's accusations.

        Parkland survivor attacks Kavanaugh's anger, alleged HS drinking: 'privileged white boy
    One of the students who survived the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, has thrown herself into the crowd of people commenting on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Emma Gonzalez, who along with David Hogg has been one of the most prominent faces of the March for Our Lives gun control movement that began in February, made her stance known on Twitter on Friday.
""Call your senators and tell them to vote no for Kavanaugh - the future of our country deserves more than a privileged white boy who’s spent his whole life over-drinking and can’t answer a simple question without acting more immature about it than a 4 year old,"" Gonzalez wrote on Twitter.

What is she talking about?Although Kavanaugh's nomination was initially called into question because of a sexual assault allegation by Palo Alto, California, professor Christine Blasey Ford, after the hearing Kavanaugh became the target of a different sort of criticism.
Now, some on the left are pointing to Kavanaugh's anger and tone of responses and using that to say he doesn't have the proper temperament to be a Supreme Court justice.

Yes, Kavanaugh is being criticized for being overly emotional during a hearing in which his career and reputation were on the line. Although it would seem more strange if someone wasn't emotional when defending themselves against sexual assault allegations, that emotion is being used to question his ability to be a fair and impartial judge.
Questions about drinkingThe other attack is a narrative that Kavanaugh had a habit of excessive drinking throughout high school in college, which stems from allegations that he was extremely drunk during two instances he's been accused of sexual assault.
Kavanaugh acknowledges that he drank beer through high school and college, but denies that he ever reached the point of blacking out or losing his memory.
Many of the questions Kavanaugh faced from Democrats on Thursday (none of which were about the allegation against him) appeared to be aimed at portraying him as someone who likely could have been so drunk that he didn't remember committing sexual assault.
Still, Kavanaugh's nomination passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, and will likely see a full Senate vote within the next two weeks, after the FBI finishes its one-week investigation into his past.

        Antonin Scalia’s son calls out ‘Mad Libs’ protests over Kavanaugh, says dad would have expected it
    The son of late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia said Sunday that his father would not have been surprised by the partisan turmoil surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
What did he say?""On a general level, he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the intensity surrounding this Supreme Court nomination, because so much of it comes down to Roe v. Wade — at least, that's how the left is presenting it,"" Christopher Scalia told Fox News.
He continued: ""My father often said, with Roe v. Wade in particular but other cases as well, the court was really trying to come in and settle a cultural issue that should have been resolved in elections, and the legislative process. By trying to short-circuit that process, the Supreme Court caused more damage and, as a result, Supreme Court nominations and confirmation battles have become more heated, because justices have taken on the role that properly belongs to legislators.""
Earlier this month, Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse made a similar point during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.
He said Congress often delegates “excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies and improperly leaves the resulting bureaucratic uncertainties to the Supreme Court to resolve — effectively making the justices supplemental legislators doing a job abdicated by senators,” the report stated.
Scalia, a public relations professional, said it was apparent from the beginning that any appointment by President Donald Trump would be protested.
""It was pretty clear from the beginning,"" Scalia said. ""Groups already had signs, basically fill-in-the-blank, they were doing Mad Libs protesting basically before President Trump nominated Kavanaugh specifically.""
He was referring to protesters who attended who carried with protest signs with spaces for them to write in the nominee's name, on the night Kavanaugh was nominated in July.
Too angry to serve?Scalia also addressed claims that Kavanaugh’s fiery and strong responses to the allegations has no impact on whether he is fit to serve. It is not uncommon for judges to get angry especially on hot-button issues, he said.
""It's really not all that rare for justices to get angry,"" Scalia said. ""It's true that [judge] Kavanaugh was perhaps more aggressive, but that's because the circumstances were a lot different.
“He was defending his good name from uncorroborated accusations,"" he added.
The FBI is expected this week to conclude allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh.

        Ford testifies that her only mutual friend with Kavanaugh was the man named by Ed Whelan
    During her testimony on Thursday, Christine Blasey Ford testified that she knew and briefly “went out with” a man that conservative pundit Ed Whelan had suggested that she may have confused with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford said that she believed this man was the only mutual friend she shared with Kavanaugh.
What did Whelan say?In a series of now-deleted tweets, Whelan announced that he had “compelling evidence” that proved Kavanaugh's “categorical denial to be truthful.”
He proceeded to use floor plans of a house and a yearbook photo as evidence to suggest that Ford may have been assaulted by a man who simply looked like Kavanaugh. Whelan named this man, and published his picture.
Whelan later apologized for making that accusation and publicizing the name of this man. He admitted that his tweets “did not advance the discussion in a constructive way.” Whelan has since taken a leave of absence from his position as president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
What did Christine Blasey Ford say?During a round of questions, outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell asked Ford about her mutual friends with Kavanaugh at the time of the incident in question. Ford testified that to the best of her recollection there was only one: The man that Whelan had identified in his tweets.
Mitchell said that she briefly “went out with” this man, but overall was only “distant friends” with him. Earlier in her testimony, Ford had insisted that there was no chance that she had confused Kavanaugh for anyone else during the alleged incident.
A transcript of the relevant portion of Ford's testimony has been provided below:
FORD: I think that that case with Mr. Whelan, who was looking at my LinkedIn page, and then trying to blame the person, I just don't think that that's right, for us to be talking about that.
M: I'm not trying to blame anybody. I just want to know who the common friend that you and —
F: The person that Mr. Whelan was trying to say looked like Mr. Kavanaugh.
M: OK. How long did you know this person?
F: [thinking] Maybe a couple of months we socialized. but he also was a member of the same country club and I knew his younger brother as well.
M: OK. so a couple months before this took place?
F: Yes.
M: OK. How would you characterize your relationship with him, both before and after this took place. This person.
F: He was somebody that — we use the phrase “I went out with,” [using air quotes], I wouldn't say date, I “went out with” [air quotes again] for a few months. that was how we termed it at the time. And after that we were distant friends, and ran into each other periodically at Columbia country club. I didn't see him often. But I saw his brother and him several times.
M: Was this person the only common link between you and Mr. — Judge kavanaugh?
F: He's the only one that I would be able to name right now, that I would like to not name, but you know who I mean. And — but there are certainly other members of Columbia Country Club that were common friends or that were more acquaintances of mine and Mr. Kavanaugh.

        Sports writer says Kavanaugh should never be allowed to coach b-ball again. The backlash is brutal.
    A USA Today sports writer incited outrage Saturday after he suggested that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should never be allowed to coach children's sports again due to the ""credible"" accusations of sexual misconduct against him.
The suggestion ignited a firestorm of controversy.
What did the reporter say?The writer, USA Today sports reporter Erik Brady, said Kavanaugh should never coach girl's basketball again absent an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against him. It's a possibility that Kavanaugh himself lamented during his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
The sports writer explained his rationale by implying Kavanaugh may be a danger to children.
""The U.S. Senate may yet confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but he should stay off basketball courts for now when kids are around,"" Brady wrote. ""The nation is newly vigilant on who coaches and trains its children given recent scandals in gymnastics and other sports.""
Brady goes on to interview Edward McFadden, spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Washington. McFadden told Brady that Kavanaugh underwent an extensive background check in order to coach his daughter's basketball team. And because Kavanaugh has a clean background and no criminal record, he remains eligible to coach.
""But should he?"" Brady questioned. ""The nation is deeply divided. Sometimes it feels like we don’t agree on anything anymore. But credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball, girls or boys, without deeper investigation. Can’t we all agree on that?""
What was the response?Outrage poured in from every corner of the internet.
Throwing a question mark over a smear doesn't make it any less disgusting https://t.co/VSSfrAhWqeAnd it starts up again-The media’s self-degradation in its pursuit of destroying Kavanaugh has no bottom. https://t.co/T12NG2NjrpWhat a repulsive item. Should never have been published. https://t.co/vqEnUssUKVLet me get this straight @USATODAY...you believe uncorroborated allegations from 30+ years ago allow in essence to call someone a pedophile? #Kavanaugh claims the media will continue to attack him and you just proved his point. Despicable. https://t.co/r22iTIqBfS""I am beyond disgusted, every person who works at USA Today should feel deeply ashamed of this article,"" another person said.
""I’m a lifelong Republican. In 2003 I married a Democrat. He pulled a Republican Ballot in 2016. After I showed him this article he went to local Republican Headquarters and picked up a yard sign for every R on the ticket. It’s unlikely he will ever vote D again,"" another critic said.
""Smearbait. No trails. No due process. News is dead,"" another person added.
""I'll be canceling my local paper because it contains your insert,"" another person wrote in response.
Anything else?USA Today editors appear to have edited the article sometime Saturday, though the actual edits were not noted. However, in examining an archived version of the article, editors seemingly deleted the article's most controversial paragraphs, the ones suggesting Kavanaugh should not be allowed to coach because ""credible"" sexual assault allegations against him endanger children.

        Kavanaugh accuser finally agrees to testify. Here are the details.
    Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week.
Ford's lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, informed the Senate Judiciary Committee of her decision Saturday afternoon just prior to the 2:30 p.m. deadline set by Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
""Dr. Ford accepts the Committee’s request to provide her first-hand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct next week,"" the attorneys said.
""Although many of the aspects you provided via email...are fundamentally inconsistent with the Committee's promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations, and we are disappointed with the leaks and the bullying that have tainted the process, we are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details,"" they went on to say.
The letter did not spell out the conditions Ford will agree to testify under, such as when and where.
Ford's agreement comes one day after Grassley again extended the deadline he gave Ford to decide whether or not she would testify to his committee and explain her allegations in detail.
The development comes after Ford's attorneys signaled at the beginning of the week that she was willing to testify before the committee. However, it later appeared that she might not when her attorneys squabbled with Grassley's committee over details, such as when she would testify, where she would offer her testimony, who would ask her questions, and in what order she would testify. She originally demanded that Kavanaugh testify first.
""This Committee has been extremely accommodating to your client. We want to hear Dr. Ford’s testimony and are prepared to accommodate many of your demands, including further delaying a hearing that is currently scheduled for Monday. We are unwilling to accommodate your unreasonable demands. Outside counsel may not dictate the terms under which Committee business will be conducted,"" the  committee's GOP majority said Friday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denies the allegations.

        Anti-Trump Latino Dem makes stunning reversal after Democrats' performance at Kavanaugh hearing
    An anti-Trump Latino man who twice voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 admits the spectacle involving Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of sexual assault, has changed everything for him.
Writing under the pseudonym Tomas Mendoza, the man explains in a new essay for The Federalist that Kavanaugh's tumultuous confirmation process — and the lack of due process — has earned Trump the vote of another Democrat.
What did Mendoza say?He wrote:
I am a college-educated, suburban, first-generation Latino immigrant. I voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012. I find President Trump to lack the basic moral character that we should expect in our political leaders and did not consider, even for a moment, voting for him in 2016. After watching how Senate Democrats and the media handled the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, however, I will be voting Republican in 2018 and for Trump in 2020.Mendoza explained that his family escaped a country that had just fell victim to a military coup, experiencing first hand ""the devastation that comes to a society when men of power believe their political objectives so justified that they are willing to pursue them by any means necessary.""
During Thursday's hearings, Mendoza saw ""that same look in the eyes of Senate Democrats,"" he said.
""The hearings made clear that the Democrats on the committee were not interested in pursuing the truth or respecting Christine Blasey Ford’s desire for anonymity. Instead, they simply sought to delay the vote in the hopes of winning the next election,"" he wrote.
""If Kavanaugh’s reputation and Ford’s privacy had to be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, the committee Democrats were not going to let basic decency prevent them from using the courts as an alternative path to the political ends they cannot reach through legislation,"" Mendoza explained.
The writer went on to say he believes both Ford and Kavanaugh, but stressed that what happened this week will have implications extending beyond the fight for Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court seat.
""That question is whether the politics of power, the politics by any means demonstrated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, will be rewarded,"" Mendoza wrote.
""If Democrats are allowed to delay this nomination and the elections in 2018 and 2020 benefit them, both Republicans and Democrats for a generation will have learned that the American people prefer to be ruled by tyrants that punish their enemies instead of representatives in a republic who adhere to the rule of law,"" he said.

        A new poll has a stunning turn for Republicans - and it's because of the Kavanaugh hearings
    A new poll appears to show that the ""blue wave"" hoped for by Democrats has crashed into a red resurgence among Republicans.
'The Republican base was awakened'The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll measured enthusiasm among voters, and found that Democrats had lost their advantage from July.
In July, 78 percent of Democrats said that the November elections were ""very important,"" while only 68 percent of Republicans answered the same.
The new poll shows that Republicans have all but erased the difference.
The latest poll has 82 percent of Democrats saying the elections are ""very important,"" and 80 percent of Republicans, placing them well within the margin error.
Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, said that the Kavanaugh hearings might have caused Republicans to become energized to support the party in the midterms.
""The result of hearings, at least in the short run, is the Republican base was awakened,"" Miringoff said.
Here's a bar graph of the results from the Marist poll:In another stunning poll released Tuesday, the Democrats' lead in the generic ballot was cut in half from 14 percentage points to 7.
Here's more about the midterm elections:
Democrats were hoping that a ""blue wave"" would result in their retaking the U.S. House of Representatives, and perhaps even the U.S. Senate. Historically, the party which controls the White House loses seats in both houses of Congress in the midterm elections after seizing the Oval Office.

        Retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy declines to analyze Kavanaugh nomination fight
    Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy had no comment Friday on the fiery fight to fill his seat.
What happened?Kennedy spoke to students and judges at the federal courthouse during a Constitution Day event Friday in Sacramento, California. While visiting the state’s capital and his hometown, Kennedy declined to wade into the debate over Judge Brett Kavanaugh, according to published reports.
Kavanaugh is President Donald Trump's choice for Kennedy’s replacement on the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh’s nomination is in peril over an accusation by esteemed college professor Christine Blasey Ford. She alleges that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers attending high school in the Washington suburbs.
He has adamantly denied the allegations.
What did Kennedy say?“No, we’ve decided carefully not to comment,” Kennedy told the Sacramento Bee as he toured a library at the courthouse that was named after him.
Kennedy instead ""politely steered questions"" to the topics of Sacramento news media and ""the Sacramento Unity Center championed by Mayor Darrell Steinberg and former television news anchors he watched,"" according to the Sacramento Bee.
What did he say about the Constitution?Kennedy did comment on the Constitution.
“The Constitution doesn’t belong to a bunch of judges and lawyers,” he said. “It’s yours, and since it’s yours you have to protect it. And you can’t protect what you don’t understand.”
Kennedy also spoke about the decline of democracy in other nations around the world, the Associated Press reported.
“Perhaps we didn’t do too good a job teaching the importance of preserving democracy by an enlightened civic discourse,” he said. “In the first part of this century we’re seeing the death and decline of democracy.”
If Kavanugh gets the Supreme Court seat, he could tip the nation’s highest court further to the right. Although Kennedy typically sided with conservative justices, he occasionally supported liberal-leaning decisions involving affirmative action at universities and gay marriage.
Kennedy, who retired in July, was nominated by Ronald Regan in 1987 and confirmed
97-0.
Although Kennedy was quiet about the Kavanaugh controversy, some students in attendance spoke out.
Seventeen-year-old Maya Steinhart, for example, told the Associated Press: “Nobody’s behaving like adults. It’s absolute chaos and it makes no sense and it’s terrifying and it’s not working.”

        Judiciary Committee votes to send Kavanaugh vote to full Senate, with one major caveat
    The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11 to 10 along party lines on Friday to recommend that the entire Senate vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But due to the request of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), the deciding vote, the committee will recommend that the vote on the floor of the Senate be postponed until the FBI can conduct a one-week investigation.
What happened?Just before the vote took place, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) spoke to Flake privately for several minutes in an attempt to get him to reconsider his position on Kavanaugh. While Coons was ultimately unable to convince Flake to vote against sending Kavanaugh to the rest of the Senate, he did convince him to ask for the committee to request an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh for one week before that final vote would take place.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pointed out that regardless of the committee's recommendation, the final decision on whether or not to delay the floor vote and request an FBI investigation rested with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) assured Flake that he would make the recommendation on his behalf, but agreed with Graham that the ultimate decision did not legally rest with him.
Ultimately, of course, whatever the Senate requests, only the Department of Justice can order the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
This stipulation was not included in the vote itself. Instead, it was a “gentlemen and women's agreement,” as Grassley described it in a hot mic moment after the hearing wrapped up.

What are other senators saying?Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another potential Republican dissenter, has indicated her support for this short FBI investigation. As has Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.), a Democrat running in a close race to keep his seat.
BREAKING: Sen. Murkowski, key Republican vote for Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, tells @NBCNews that she supports Sen. Flake's call for a brief reopening of FBI background investigation on Kavanaugh before a full Senate vote - @LACaldwellDC— NBC News (@NBCNews) September 28, 2018In a news release on Friday, Manchin said:
Murkowski and Manchin, along with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) have not yet committed to voting either yes or no on Kavanaugh. Since Republicans currently have 49 senators committed to voting to confirm, and Vice President Mike Pence is permitted to cast a tie-breaking vote in his role as president of the Senate, only one of these four senators needs to vote yes in order for Kavanaugh to be confirmed.
Does Trump have the final decision?Even if McConnell decided to approve delaying the vote for a week, the Senate does not have the authority to order an FBI investigation. Instead, he or another member of the Senate would have to request that the Justice Department authorize one.
The final decision on whether or not to conduct an investigation would then rest with either the Justice Department or with President Donald Trump.
For his part, Trump has indicated that he won't get in the way of the Senate on this matter, saying after being told of Flake's request “whatever they think is necessary is OK.”

        Bill Maher rips Lindsey Graham for defending Kavanaugh, says senator needs his 'dead boyfriend' McCain
    HBO host Bill Maher bashed Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) Friday for his defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying Graham needs “the stabilizing influence of his dead boyfriend,” a reference to the late Sen. John McCain.
What did he say?“The fact that Trump can either find people like him or make him...Lindsey Graham needs the stabilizing influence of his dead boyfriend,” Maher, the host of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" said during a panel discussion. He was referring to McCain, who died Aug. 25 at age 81.
Maher leveled multiple shots at Graham, including a comment that the South Carolina senator was “familiar” with the “back door.”
He also suggested that Graham's defense of Kavanaugh was a performance bid for Graham to get a position with President Donald Trump’s administration.
Graham stepped to the forefront during the Thursday hearings of Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford. She has accused the judge of a sexual assault she says happened in 1982.
Graham accused Democrats of attempting to destroy Kavanaugh, calling their actions “the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.”
“What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020,” Graham told Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats. “Boy, y’all want power and I hope you don’t get it.”
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.
A guest, CNN commentator April Ryan said she believes Kavanaugh spoke just to impress Trump.
“He was rehearsed. He talked about the press, he talked about the Clintons,” Ryan said. “He was too rehearsed. He was so bombastic.”
Did Maher bring Kavanaugh's daughter into it?Maher also said Kavanaugh lied about his 10-year-old daughter praying for Blasey Ford.
“That’s what actors do!” Maher said, commenting on Kavanaugh’s emotional opening statement to the Senate committee. “They make s*** up!”
During Thursday's hearing Graham commented on the idea that Kavanaugh is going through a job interview.
""This is not a job interview,"" Graham said. ""This is hell.""

        Second Kavanaugh accuser won't talk to Congress, but still wants an FBI investigation
    After accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in a New Yorker article Sunday night, Deborah Ramirez's lawyer said Ramirez will not testify about the allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Washington Examiner reported.
Republicans attempted to reach out to Ramirez after publication of the report, which was written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, who were unable to find a single other person who could corroborate the story.
""Our counsel repeatedly tried to reach [Ramirez's lawyer],"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said, according to the Examiner. ""They finally did reach him, and he said we are not issuing a statement. He said if you want our statement, read The New Yorker.""
Why wouldn't she testify?Ramirez and her legal counsel apparently have no interest in elaborating on the accusation past what she told The New Yorker, which was that Kavanaugh exposed himself to Ramirez and put his genitals in her face at a party in the dorms at Yale during their freshman year.
It's possible Ramirez wants to avoid the spotlight and conflict that surrounds the first woman to accuse Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford. After days of back-and-forth with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford is set to testify about her allegation Thursday.
Ramirez admitted in The New Yorker's report that her memory of the incident was not complete, and Farrow and Mayer wrote that Ramirez was hesitant to share her story in the first place.
""For Ramirez, the sudden attention has been unwelcome, and prompted difficult choices,"" the article reads. ""She was at first hesitant to speak publicly, partly because her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident. In her initial conversations with The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty.""
Still wants an FBI investigation?Since Ramirez's lawyer pointed people to the article in The New Yorker for a statement, that indicates that her desire for an FBI investigation into this alleged incident, which she said took place during the 1983-84 school year, still stands.
""I would think an FBI investigation would be warranted,"" Ramirez is quoted as saying in The New Yorker.

        SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, set to testify this morning
    Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday. After Ford finishes, Kavanaugh will be given a chance to testify. Before the hearing began, Ford and Kavanaugh released prepared statements.
What is Ford saying?In her prepared testimony for the hearing, Ford repeated her allegations against Kavanaugh. Ford stressed that it was not her first choice to testify before the committee.
""I am here today not because I want to be,"" she wrote. ""I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.""
Ford recounted the same story she has told several times before, describing how she remembered being at a party and having a drunk Kavanaugh push her into a bedroom and try to take her clothes off.
She also addressed why it took years before she told anyone about the incident.
Ford also talked about the threats that she and her family had received since she came forward. She said that after her personal information was posted online, they were forced to leave their home and ""have been living in various secure locales, with guards.""
She concluded by promising to do her ""very best"" to answer any questions posed at her during the hearing.
What is Kavanaugh saying?In his own prepared statement, Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations ""immediately, unequivocally, and categorically."" He called Ford's accusations, and those by the other women who have come forward, ""false and uncorroborated.""
Kavanaugh argued that these accusations weren't just a threat to his own nomination:
He also insisted that he would ""not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process."" He spoke about ""vile threats of violence"" that had been leveled against his family.
Kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting Ford or anyone else, but said that all accusations of sexual assault in any circumstance ""must be taken seriously,"" and that ""[t]hose who make allegations deserve to be heard.""
He concluded by saying:

        Senate staff talked to men who believe they, not Kavanaugh, had 1982 encounter with Ford, docs show
    Two men have told Senate Judiciary Committee staffers that they believe they -- not Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- had the sexual encounter with Christine Blasey Ford which is the basis of her sexual assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee.
Documents released by majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday evening threw a new wrinkle into the accusations against Kavanaugh, the night before he and Ford are scheduled to testify about the situation.
Republican members of the committee released a summary timeline of staff activities related to the numerous sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. The timeline includes several bullet points that indicate two men have said Kavanaugh did not sexually assault Christine Blasey Ford at a 1982 party -- because they did it.
Daily Mail political editor David Martosko posted screenshots from the timeline on Twitter, highlighting these key items.

What did the documents say? 	From Sept. 25:
 	And from Sept. 26:
 	 	What else do we know?Not much, and that's a problem for some people who accuse the Senate Republicans of maliciously releasing this information, with little detail, the night before Ford is scheduled to testify.

Elana Schor of Politico pointed out the potential chaos that will result from senators having to address questions about these newly-released details first thing Thursday morning.

        Kavanaugh accuser 'should have held her tongue,' law prof says. Now a petition wants prof to resign.
    An outspoken law professor at the University of Pennsylvania is under fire once again for her words.
Previously excoriated for saying Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior and removed from first-year lecture classes after saying “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a black student graduate in the top quarter of the class,"" Amy Wax now is being criticized for comments about Christine Blasey Ford.
Wax said Ford — who accused newly sworn-in Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers over 35 years ago — should have kept her mouth shut.
“I think it's a stale allegation. I think it violates principles of basic fair play for her to be bringing this up. I think she should have held her tongue. If I were her, I would have,” Wax told Brown University economist Glenn Loury on his YouTube show late last month. “I think basic dignity and fairness dictates that, you know, 'It’s too late, Ms. Ford' .. even if there would have been consequences to bitching about it at the time.""
Wax also said that even if Kavanaugh committed the act Ford described, he shouldn't be punished for it now.
“Even if he did it — 17 years old. We now are saying that a man is gonna pay for the rest of his life for a momentary act of, you know, recklessness ... which didn’t create any permanent harm except through this manufactured idea that this is such a horrible, traumatic thing,"" Wax said. ""It's not a good thing. But honestly, you know, the woman is not gonna recover from that? And his whole now life is ruined.”
Here's the clip. Wax's relevant comments come just after the 51:30 mark:
<U+FEFF>
What else did Wax say?Wax — who is the Robert Mundheim Professor of Law at Penn — also criticized the #MeToo movement for turning women into “incredibly fragile, vulnerable creatures” and for pushing a “childish” idea of justice, the College Fix said.
The outlet added that Loury seemed to agree with Wax, describing the allegations against Kavanaugh as a “slash and burn” attack.
What happened next?A petition titled, “This Professor Thinks Sexual Violence Victims Should Keep Their Trauma to Themselves” soon surfaced calling for Wax to resign from Penn Law. It had nearly 18,000 signatures as of Wednesday morning.
“When a university allows one of their professors to excoriate victims of sexual violence all while minimizing the trauma caused by the assailant, what kind of message is that institution sending to their students?” the petition asks.
Wax told The College Fix she didn't want to comment on the petition or her status at the law school. The outlet added that neither Penn Law Dean Theodore Ruger nor Rebecca Anderson, associate director of communications, responded to multiple requests for comment.
Black Lives Matter wanted her gone, tooThe leader of Black Lives Matter Pennsylvania in March called for Penn Law to fire Wax over saying she didn't know of any black student graduating in the top quarter of the class.
Ruger countered Wax's comments in an email to the campus community, saying ""black students have graduated in the top of the class.”
The College Fix said the school didn't provide figures and ignored repeated requests for an explanation.
Here's a clip of Wax discussing dissent and disagreement a year ago:

        Democrats threaten aggressive Kavanaugh probe if they win a majority in November
    Congressional Democrats said they would investigate sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court without an extensive background probe and the party reclaims Congress.
Who said this?According to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), “as soon as Democrats get gavels,” the party will push an investigation, even if Kavanaugh is already seated on the high court by that time, various media outlets reported.
Rep. Eric Swallwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, also said in an interview that the party could push an investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
""If they ramrod this nomination through, and we win the majority, we can still investigate this on the House side, and certainly the question as to whether a Supreme Court justice committed perjury is something you could look at,” Swalwell said. ""Hopefully it doesn’t come to that; hopefully they do this right.""
He added: ""Because it’s going to get investigated either way and it would be better not to have to investigate a sitting judge.”
The comments underscore a persistent Democratic focus on Kavanaugh. And it could spur the turnout of more liberal voters in November, regardless of whether the GOP confirms him.
“You can't ignore a crime victim's claim that something happened, refuse to investigate, throw her up into the stand without the least bit of support for her, without the least bit of effort to corroborate what she says and then walk away from that,” Whitehouse told CNN.
If Democrats take the House or Senate, Democratic chairmen “could use their subpoena authority to make Kavanaugh's first year on the bench miserable,” Politico reported.
Would this be unusual?If the turn of events led to the opening of impeachment investigative proceedings for Kavanaugh, it would be a rare move, the news outlet noted. The last time Congress initiated its own impeachment inquiry was 1980. That’s when lawmakers created the Judicial Conference of the United States which oversees “complaints about the conduct or disability of federal judges.”
Congress typically takes up the issue only if the Judicial Conference refers a case to Capitol Hill, the report noted. In the past, judges who get into trouble will often resign before the complaints become public.

        Democratic senator seeking federal injunction to stop a final vote on SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh
    Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) is filing suit asking a federal court to halt the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in light of the sexual misconduct allegations levied against Kavanaugh.
You can read more about the allegations here, here, and here.
What are the details?On Wednesday, Merkley tweeted, ""I’m suing @realDonaldTrump & @senatemajldr today to stop the unconstitutional #KavanaughConfirmation process. They may want to ram through this nomination come hell or high water, but that’s just not how our Constitution works.""

They may want to ram through this nomination come hell or high water, but that’s just not how our Constitution works.— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) September 26, 2018Merkley, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid, said that the intention was to prevent the Senate from taking up Kavanaugh's confirmation until his ""full record"" is available and disclosed.
Merkley's office said that the senator's lawsuit alleges that the defendants' handling of Kavanaugh's nomination violated the ""separation of powers and the advice and consent clause"" by withholding any documentation pertaining to Kavanaugh and his background.
Capitol Hill reporter Paul McLeod spoke with Merkley, and tweeted, ""Democratic Senator Merkley is filing a lawsuit over the Kavanaugh nomination and seeking an injunction on a confirmation vote. He argues the White House has violated the separation of powers by obstructing the Senate's investigation (by withholding documents, for example).""

Merkley responded that he was fairly sure this would be an unprecedented event.
""This is uncharted territory,"" Merkley added.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday.

        Former Yale classmate claims Kavanaugh exposed himself during their freshman year at a party
    New allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh come just days before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
In a report in The New Yorker on Sunday, Deborah Ramirez came forward with her claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party when they were freshmen classmates at Yale University during the 1983-84 school year.
According to The New Yorker report, the accusations were not corroborated by any other attendees at the party, and Ramirez herself admitted to being uncertain that the person who allegedly exposed himself was even Kavanaugh. The New York Times also reported that it had attempted to confirm Ramirez's accusations, but after interviewing ""dozens"" of classmates, they were unable to find a single person with first-hand knowledge of the incident. Further, many of those contacted by the Times stated that Ramirez told them she couldn't be certain that Kavanaugh was the offender.
“I would think an FBI investigation would be warranted,” Ramirez said, according to The New Yorker.
Ramirez told the magazine that she, Kavanaugh and a few other students were playing a drinking game in a dorm room when the alleged incident happened.
Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez's allegations.
What's the story?The 53-year-old woman admitted she was drunk when Kavanaugh allegedly exposed his penis and forced her to touch it without her consent, the magazine said.
“We were sitting in a circle,” Ramirez said. “People would pick who drank.”
Ramirez said she was chosen repeatedly and quickly became drunk and that sometime during the game, a male student pointed a plastic penis toward her.
She ended up on the floor ""foggy and slurring her words"" as the male student and another stood close by her.
Those two male students were not named in The New Yorker's story at Ramirez's request.
“I remember a penis being in front of my face,” she said. “I knew that’s not what I wanted, even in that state of mind.”
“That’s not a real penis,” she said she recalled saying while the others laughed at her and encouraged her to ""kiss it.""
Ramirez said in the process of pushing the guy away, she touched the penis.
""I wasn’t going to touch a penis until I was married,” she told the magazine. “I was embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated.”
According to Ramirez, the penis belonged to Kavanaugh who she alleges was pulling up his pants while he was laughing.
“Brett was laughing,” she said. “I can still see his face, and his hips coming forward, like when you pull up your pants.
“Somebody yelled down the hall, ‘Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis in Debbie’s face,’ ” Ramirez said. “It was his full name. I don’t think it was just ‘Brett.’ And I remember hearing and being mortified that this was out there.”
Are there holes in her story?The New Yorker has not confirmed Ramirez's story with the other witnesses who were reportedly at the dorm party.
Ramirez told The New Yorker that she initially hesitated to share her story because there were gaps in her memories of the incident and reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's alleged role with certainty.
But after she consulted with her attorney and spent six days recalling her memories, she ""felt confident enough"" to come forward.
Ramirez also contacted former classmates who were unable to verify with certainty that Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.
Another male classmate who allegedly egged Ramirez on has denied any memory of the party, according to Fox News.
Six of Kavanaugh's classmates penned a statement that said this type of behavior would be ""completely out of character"" for him.
""We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it — and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett,"" according to the statement. ""In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett’s Supreme Court nomination was pending.""
One of the women who signed the letter told the magazine that she was ""best friends"" with Ramirez and had never heard of such an incident.
""We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn’t see it; I never heard of it happening,"" the woman said, according to Fox News.
What did Kavanaugh say?""This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement.
""The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name – and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building – against these last-minute allegations,"" he said.
What did the White House say?White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Ramirez's allegation part of a ""coordinated smear campaign.""
""This 35-year-old, uncorroborated claim is the latest in a coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man,"" Kupec said in a statement to reporters, USA Today reported. ""This claim is denied by all who were said to be present and is wholly inconsistent with what many women and men who knew Judge Kavanaugh at the time in college say. The White House stands firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh.""
What else?Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has called on the committee's Republicans to postpone all proceedings related to Kavanaugh's nomination and refer Ramirez's allegation to the FBI.
""I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh,"" Feinstein wrote, NPR reported. ""I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation, and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims.
""It is time to set politics aside,"" Feinstein continued. ""We must ensure that a thorough and fair investigation is conducted before moving forward.""

        Kavanaugh debate leads Georgia college students to start petition to rename Clarence Thomas Center
    The Brett Kavanaugh hearings have re-opened a debate about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his confirmation hearing in 1991, according to published reports.
Thomas was investigated by the FBI after attorney Anita Hill accused him of sexual harassment.
What is happening?Now, some students at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, are calling for the renaming of the Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation.
A petition on change.org called “Take A Sexual Predator’s Name Off of SCAD’s Building” and had more than 1,100 signatures Sunday.
The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation on the campus was formerly a convent and Thomas had served there as an altar boy, WJCL-TV reported.
The building was named after him in 2010, according to the report.
Sage Lucero, who graduated from SCAD, started the petition. She told the TV station she was shocked when she learned the history of the Clarence Thomas Center.
“I don’t want any other female who has hopes and dreams to have to walk through the doors of that building. They shouldn’t have to be subjugated to that toxic feeling,” Lucero said.
Sarah Boussey, a senior at the college who signed the petition, said the name of the building sends the wrong message.
“By naming a building after Clarence Thomas makes it feel as though sexual assault in the workplace isn’t taken seriously...In this current political climate with what’s going on with Kavanugh, something needs to change,” Boussey told the TV station.
Andrew Paynter, a senior at the college, said he’s neutral about he idea of renaming the building. But he took issue with the wording on the petition.
“Their bold claims seem to be too harmful,” Paynter told WJCL. “In our society, you just can’t accuse people of things.""
What is the background?When Clarence Thomas was nominated for the Supreme Court, Anita Hill came forward and alleged he had sexually harassed her while she was his employee. Thomas denied the allegations and faced a series of hearings. The Senate eventually voted 52-48 to confirm Thomas to the Supreme Court.
Thomas was viewed as a justice who would likely lean conservative on decisions involving issues such as Affirmative Action and abortion, according to the George Mason University website.

        Clinton accuser Juanita Broaddrick doesn’t believe Ford’s ‘sketchy and vague’ Kavanaugh accusations
    Juanita Broaddrick, who accused former President Bill Clinton of a 1978 rape, said that she doesn't believe the allegations of sexual assault levied against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
What did she say?In a Wednesday interview with The Daily Caller, Broaddrick called Christine Blasey Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh ""sketchy and vague.""
""It's not because I'm a Trump supporter that I don't believe Christine Ford,"" Broaddrick said. ""That really has nothing to do with it. It has to do with me being a victim and listening to other victims, and this just doesn't ring clear.""
She added, ""It's not what you would think that a victim statement would be.""
Broaddrick later said that she can't imagine why Ford would sit on such allegations for more than three decades.
“I can’t imagine if it was as frightening as she says that it was and that she feared for her life, I can’t imagine not knowing and remember more about it, or not telling someone,” she reasoned.
Broaddrick also warned against relying on memory as the sole source of such recollections.
“You cannot depend upon memory,” Broaddrick said. “You have to have evidence.”
Broaddrick, despite claiming to be a victim, isn't a fan of the #MeToo movement.
“The [#MeToo] movement, to me, is for liberal women,” she explained. “They want nothing to do with the Clinton victims.”
“I think [#MeToo] is on its way out,” she added.

Anything else?Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a party when the two were in high school in the '80s. Kavanaugh has categorically denied these allegations.
Ford will provide her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday.
You can read more about the allegations here, here, and here.
Broaddrick also showed up for the hearing Thursday to confront Democrats over their hypocrisy.
Fox News correspondent Ellison Barber tweeted a photo of Broaddrick outside of Dirksen Senate building.
""Juanita Broaddrick is outside of Dirksen Senate building,"" Barber wrote. ""Broaddrick says she does not believe Dr Ford, and Democrats supporting her now are 'hypocrites' because they didn’t support her.""

        Trump issues full-throated defense of Kavanaugh: Misconduct allegations are ‘totally political’
    President Donald Trump issued a statement that minced no words in defense of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the sexual assault allegations levied against the Supreme Court pick.
What did he say?Trump reaffirmed his support for Kavanaugh in a bold new statement, calling the allegations against the SCOTUS nominee ""totally political.""
Speaking Monday at the United Nations in New York City, Trump doubled down on his praises of Kavanaugh, calling the judge “outstanding.”
“I am with him all the way,” the president added, according to a Monday report by the The Associated Press.
""I think it could be — a chance that this could be — the single-most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything, but I am with Judge Kavanaugh,"" he explained. ""For people to come out of the woodwork from 36 years ago and 30 years ago and never mentioned it, all of a sudden happens, in my opinion, it's totally political.""
He later repeated himself wagging his finger. ""It's totally political.""
<U+FEFF>
What's the background?Professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an incident that she said took place in the early 1980s.
Ford, now 51, delivered the information in a letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July, shortly after Trump chose Kavanaugh as the nominee for Supreme Court justice. Feinstein — the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee — eventually turned the letter over to the FBI.
According to Ford’s account, she attended a house party with Kavanaugh and other teens at a Maryland home in 1982. Ford wrote that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom along with a male companion. Kavanaugh then allegedly locked the door, put on loud music to muffle sound, and reportedly attempted to remove Ford’s clothing.
Ford said that Kavanaugh and his male friend, who were reportedly drunk, laughed. At one point, Ford said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to stifle her protests. She later revealed that she thought he might inadvertently kill her during the alleged incident.
Kavanaugh flatly denied Ford’s allegations: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
Kavanaugh has said that he is willing to testify again in front of the committee in response to the allegations.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,” Kavanaugh said last week.
What else?A second woman has come forward and accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a party at Yale. Kavanaugh has also denied these allegations, and no other witnesses have come forward to corroborate the story.
Likewise, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, has claimed that he has unspecified incriminating evidence about Kavanaugh.
The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Kavanaugh.
Ford is set to testify Thursday.

        President Donald Trump calls women’s Kavanaugh accusations a Democratic ‘con game’
    President Donald Trump unloaded on Democrats and those women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in a Tuesday statement, calling the entire notion a Democratic ""con game.""
What did he say?During a photo opportunity Tuesday with Colombia's President Iván Duque Márquez at the United Nations General Assembly, Trump said that the two women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct are all part of a greater smear campaign.
""I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done,"" Trump said. ""It's a con game they're playing. They're really con artists. ... They don't believe [the allegations] themselves. They know he's a high quality person. It's just resist and obstruct.""
According to Time, Trump also said Christine Blasey Ford's accusations about an alleged sexual assault incident that reportedly occurred in the '80s were ""totally unsubstantiated.""
“He’s never had any charges like this,” Trump added. “I mean charges come up from 36 years ago that are totally unsubstantiated. ... Thirty-six years ago? Nobody ever knew about it. Nobody ever heard about it.”
The president also attacked Deborah Ramirez, a second woman who came forward with allegations against the nominee, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her during a college drinking game at Yale University.
“[N]ow a new charge comes up and [Ramirez] said it might not be him and there were gaps and she said she was totally inebriated and she was all messed up and she doesn’t know if it was him but it might have been him, oh, gee, let’s not make him a Supreme Court judge because of that,” Trump said. “This is a con game being played by the Democrats.”
He added, “The second accuser has nothing. She admits that she was drunk. She admits time lapses.""

What did Kavanaugh say?Kavanaugh has denied all allegations. In a Monday night interview with Fox News' Martha MacCallum, Kavanaugh professed his innocence.
""What I know is the truth, and the truth is I've never sexually assaulted anyone,"" Kavanaugh said, noting that he refused to withdraw his name from Supreme Court consideration.
""I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity, and I know I'm telling the truth,"" Kavanaugh added. ""I know my lifelong record and I'm not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process. I have faith in God and I have faith in the fairness of the American people.""

        Kavanaugh accuser's attorneys iron out details. Here's when Christine Ford will testify.
    Attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, vowed Sunday that Ford will testify at a hearing scheduled for Thursday morning.
What are the details?According to Politico, Ford's attorneys talked with Senate Judiciary Committee aides on Sunday where the two sides hashed out the details of Ford's appearance. Despite unresolved ""procedural and logistical issues,"" which Ford's lawyers squabbled over last week, the attorneys promised Ford's appearance.
Officially, the two sides agreed that the hearing would take place at 10 a.m. Thursday morning.
In a statement, Ford's attorneys — Debra Katz, Lisa Banks, and Michael Bromwich — confirmed ""important progress"" had been made.
""We committed to moving forward with an open hearing on Thursday Sept 27 at 10:00 am,"" the attorneys said. ""Despite actual threats to her safety and to her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for Senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her.""
The attorneys made it clear they take umbrage with the fact that Mark Judge, who Ford alleges was with Kavanaugh when he committed the assault, will not be subpoenaed. The lawyers also said it is not clear who, from the Republican majority, will question Ford. Some Republicans have said independent counsel should do the questioning, while Ford has requested that senators themselves question her.
It was also not clear in which order Ford and Kavanaugh will testify. Previously, Ford demanded that Kavanaugh defend himself first before she testifies.
The hearing will likely push the vote to confirm Kavanaugh back to October. The Judiciary Committee was previously scheduled to vote on Kavanaugh last week, but delayed the vote because of Ford's accusations. That means the new Supreme Court term, which begins on Oct. 1, will likely begin one justice short.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/24/ford-adviser-allegedly-said-in-july-that-a-strategy-would-emerge-to-defeat-kavanaugh-nomination","
        Ford adviser allegedly said in July that a 'strategy' would 'emerge' to defeat Kavanaugh nomination
    Ricki Seidman — who was involved in Anita Hill's 1991 sexual harassment testimony against Clarence Thomas prior to his Supreme Court confirmation and is now advising Christine Blasey Ford regarding her sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — allegedly said in July that a ""strategy"" would ""emerge"" in the ensuing days and weeks to defeat Kavanaugh.
Seidman made the statement in a conference call with the American Constitution Society, BizPac Review said.
“I do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think it’s possible that that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee,” Seidman allegedly said in an audio recording. “And whether or not it ultimately defeats the nominee, it will, I think, help people understand why it’s so important that they vote and the deeper principles that are involved in it.”
The audio was posted to YouTube by the GOP War Room — the ""official account for the Republican National Committee's War Room"" that focuses on ""Democrats’ scandals and hypocrisy, media commentary, and [President Donald] Trump's accomplishments.""
Neither Seidman nor the American Constitution Society immediately replied Monday to TheBlaze's requests for comment on the audio.
Exactly what ""strategy"" might be used to derail Kavanaugh's nomination isn't noted in the audio, but Seidman allegedly added that ""as the strategy becomes clearer"" it should ""partly be, beyond Kavanaugh ... what we want the court to be, what the court is supposed to be under the Constitution, and what putting Kavanaugh on the court means for the institution.""
Here's the audio. The relevant portion begins around the 3:20 mark:
<U+FEFF>
Timing of ""strategy"" statementThe date of the conference call isn't clear, but there is a reference at the 4:45 mark in the audio to ""anyone who read Akhil Amar's op-ed in the New York Times today."" That piece, in which the Yale Law School professor backs Kavanaugh for a spot on the high court, was published July 9 — the same day Trump announced his nomination.
Ford's letter to Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) regarding her allegations against Kavanaugh was dated July 30.
Politico reported Friday on Seidman advising Ford, noting that the Democratic operative said, “I believe her, and I think she’s very courageous for coming this far.""
What else is in Seidman's background?Seidman's bio for TSD Communications, where she's a senior principal, says she ""took a leave of absence in 2008 to work for President [Barack] Obama’s general election campaign, serving as Vice President Joe Biden’s communications director. In the spring and summer of 2009, she assisted the White House in the successful confirmation effort for President Obama’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor.""
Her bio added that she has ""held several senior White House positions during the Clinton Administration, including White House Deputy Communications Director, Counselor to the Chief of Staff, and Director of Scheduling and Advance for the President; and she subsequently served as Deputy Associate Attorney General in the Department of Justice. She headed the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign’s 'War Room,' and directed a similar effort for the successful passage of the Clinton economic plan in 1993.""
Politico added that Republicans viewed the revelation that Seidman is advising Ford as an indication that Democrats are attempting to ramp up her accusation to kill the Kavanaugh confirmation.
“This feels more like a Democratic super PAC than a legal effort to get at the truth,” a senior Republican official told the outlet regarding Seidman’s role with Ford.
“If you’re concerned about an appearance of partisanship, hiring a Democratic operative with a history of smearing conservative judges doesn't exactly mitigate that,” Cassie Smedile, press secretary for the Republican National Committee, added to Politico.

        New York Times stealth edits story on Kavanaugh accuser, cuts out important detail
    The New York Times has edited a piece it wrote on one of Kavanaugh's accusers, removing language that cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the accuser's story.
The author of the story later claimed on Twitter that the language had never been in the story to begin with — but multiple internet archives confirm that the paragraph was, in fact, in the original version of the story and has since been removed.
What happened?On Sunday, The New Yorker published a piece by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer highlighting an accusation by Deborah Ramirez against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. That same night, the New York Times published an article covering the New Yorker story, in which they admitted that they were unable to confirm the details of this report.
Even more damaging to Ramirez's accusations, the Times stated that in the course of attempting to confirm Ramirez's account, they spoke to many people who indicated that Ramirez told them she wasn't even sure if Kavanaugh was the person who allegedly exposed himself.
The original version of the first New York Times article said:
That paragraph appeared in the Sunday article, and again verbatim in a second article on Monday. However, the Monday article, which contained the most up-to-date account of events, was later updated to remove the text in question.
Here's a screenshot of the relevant portion of the original article from Monday:
 Image source: Screenshot of New York Times article
In the updated version of the Monday article, which underwent a substantial rewrite, the paragraph above, circled in green was gone. Likewise, the print version of Tuesday's New York Times omits this paragraph. However, the Times added the following paragraph defending The New Yorker and bashing Republicans for using its reporting to criticize Democrats:
But the Times did not rebut her account and, unlike The New Yorker, was not able to obtain an interview with Ms. Ramirez.The first version gave no indication that the Times had not contacted Ramirez directly. The updated version did not include an editor's note revealing that it had been updated.
The site NewsDiffs, which tracks changes that have been made to news articles over times, likewise confirms that the Monday article was substantially rewritten, and that the paragraph circled in green was removed entirely. You can see the full NewsDiffs result here.  As seen in this screenshot, the paragraph circled in green was summarily removed from the story.
CNN's Michael Smerconish discovered the inconsistency and tweeted about it:
“Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the episode and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.” Why is this sentence now gone from this @nytimes story? https://t.co/ufSehglkTm— Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) September 25, 2018The first version of Monday's story was written by Times congressional correspondent Sheryl Gay Stolberg. The second updated version of the same story had both Stolberg and Catie Edmondson in the byline.
 
On Tuesday, Stolberg responded to Smerconish's tweet, claiming that the section in question was not ""deleted,"" but ""was never there in the first place.""
The story links to the previous day’s article, which included the sentence you cite. The sentence is not “now gone,” which implies it was deleted. It was never in there in the first place.— Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 25, 2018However, archived versions of the original article debunk this dubious claim by Stolberg.  TheBlaze has reached out to the New York Times for comment, but has not yet received a response.
You can read both versions of the New York Times article from Monday below. The first version:

        Jimmy Kimmel suggests cutting off Brett Kavanaugh’s penis if he’s confirmed to Supreme Court
    Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has suggested that if Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, Kavanaugh — who stands accused of sexual misconduct that reportedly occurred in the '80s — should have his penis cut off.
Yes, that's correct: The very same Kimmel ,who was once lauded by television networks and magazines as ""America's conscience"" and a ""moral compass"" and who refused to condemn Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, thinks it's OK to joke about castrating a could-be Supreme Court justice.
What did Kimmel say?During his Monday night monologue, Kimmel addressed Christine Blasey's Ford accusations of sexual misconduct against the high court nominee.
""Hear me out on this,"" Kimmel said. ""So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK? Well, in return, we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone.""
When the audience laughed in response to his joke, he responded, ""No? That's not good?""
The late-night show host previously mocked the Supreme Court nominee for a Monday interview in which Kavanaugh admitted to being a virgin until ""many years after"" after college in defending himself from Ford's accusations.
""I've never sexually assaulted anyone,"" Kavanaugh told Fox News' Martha MacCallum during the interview. ""I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter ... The girls from the schools I went to, and I, were friends.""
""Through all these years that were in question, you were a virgin?"" MacCallum asked.
Kavanaugh responded in the affirmative, noting that he only lost his virginity ""many years after"" college.
“Thank you for admitting that,"" Kimmel quipped after playing footage of Kavanaugh's interview. “[Kavanaugh] was a virgin until many years after. So if he doesn't get to be on the Supreme Court, maybe he'll be 'The Bachelor.'""
What's the background on these allegations?Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an incident that she said took place when the two were in high school. She was 15 and he was 17.
Ford conveyed the information in a letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July, shortly after Trump named Kavanaugh as a nominee for Supreme Court justice. Feinstein — the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee — eventually turned the letter over to the FBI.
According to Ford, she attended a house party with Kavanaugh and other teens in 1982. Ford wrote that Kavanaugh and a male friend pushed her into a bedroom. Kavanaugh then allegedly locked the door, put on loud music to muffle sound, and reportedly attempted to remove Ford's clothing.
Ford said that Kavanaugh and his male companion, who were reportedly drunk, laughed. Ford also said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to stifle her cries. She later said that she thought he might inadvertently kill her during the alleged incident.
Kavanaugh flatly denied Ford's allegations: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.""
Kavanaugh has said that he is willing to testify again in front of the committee in response to the allegations.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,"" Kavanaugh said last week.
A second woman also came forward and accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a party at Yale. Kavanaugh also denied these allegations, and no other witnesses have come forward to corroborate the story at the time of this writing.
Also, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, has claimed that he has unspecified incriminating evidence about Kavanaugh.
Ford is set to testify Thursday in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

        ND-Sen: Kevin Cramer takes heat for questioning if allegations disqualify Kavanaugh from SCOTUS
    North Dakota's at-large congressman, Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, is taking heat for questioning if the sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court — even if they're true.
Cramer's comments, which have been widely covered in the mainstream media Tuesday, are significant because he is currently battling to unseat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) in a crucial race. Their coverage underscores the impact of Kavanaugh's nomination on the midterm elections.
What did Cramer say?Cramer said in an interview with KVLY-TV Monday:
Even if it's all true, does it disqualify him? It certainly means that he did something really bad 36 years ago, but does it disqualify him from the Supreme Court?The interviewer, Chris Berg, followed up asking if Kavanaugh should be disqualified from serving on the Supreme Court if it's later discovered the allegations are true. The implication being that Kavanaugh is dishonest and has lied even as recent as during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee when he denied ever being engaged in sexual misconduct as an adult.
""If it’s found that he knew, that he recalls it, he knew it happened, and lies about it, then I think that would disqualify him,"" Cramer responded.
At any rate, Cramer does not buy the allegations against Kavanuagh. Last week, during a radio interview with KNOX-AM, Cramer called the first accuser's accusations ""even more absurd"" than those made against now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.
Indeed, Cramer told Berg he also does not find the second allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh credible, calling it ""far more suspicious than the first one.""
""The timing of all of it raises suspicion about the validation of any of it,"" he said.

How did Heitkamp respond?After Cramer's initial comments calling Ford's accusation ""absurd,"" Heitkamp tweeted, ""Congressman Cramer's comments are disturbing and they don't reflect the values of North Dakota.""

Her campaign spokeswoman, Julia Krieger, later told media following Cramer's Monday interview: ""Once again, Congressman Cramer displays a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience. While Heidi is committed to listening to the testimony of both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, Congressman Cramer has already prejudged.""

        New survey reveals American sentiment on credibility of Kavanaugh accuser's accusations
    A new poll released last week found that only a small percentage of Americans find the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh credible.
What did the poll find?The HuffPo/YouGov poll found that overall, only 26 percent of those polled find the accusations credible. Meanwhile, 28 percent said they don't believe the accusations while 32 percent said they have not heard enough about the allegations to make a determination and 14 percent aren't sure.
Among registered voters, the percentage of those who don't find the accusations credible jumped to 37 percent. Meanwhile, only 25 percent of women said they believe the accusations.
If the accusations are proved true, just 39 percent of respondents said they should disqualify Kavanaugh from serving on the Supreme Court. Another 18 percent said such a revelation would be relevant to Kavanaugh's nomination — but not worthy of disqualification — while 20 percent said it would not be relevant. Another 23 percent said they aren't sure.
Still, only 35 percent of respondents said Kavanaugh should withdraw his Supreme Court nomination.
Fortunately for Kavanaugh, an overwhelming majority of respondents, 63 percent, agreed that he ""would be a good Supreme Court justice.""
The poll surveyed 1,000 adults between Sept. 17-18. See the full results here.

        Yale Law School cancels classes so students can protest 'very real threat' of Kavanaugh
    Students at Yale Law School are protesting against the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh because of sexual assault allegations against him -- and now the school has cancelled classes to accommodate them, according to The Cut.
These future lawyers of America have been protesting both on campus and in Washington, D.C. to convince lawmakers to vote against confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, so the school cancelled more than 30 scheduled classes Monday morning in anticipation of widespread absences.
“As a community, we are here today to show that we take allegations of sexual assault and harassment seriously,” said Diane Lake, a second-year law student, according to the Hartford Courant. “We are here today to discuss the very real threat that Brett Kavanaugh poses to this country.""
How big are the protests?Yale Law School students began silent protests last week, after California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when the two were in high school.
This week, more than a hundred students traveled to D.C. to protest at the Supreme Court and to meet with Senators about the nomination. The increased protest activity is owed to another sexual assault allegation by Deborah Ramirez, who told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while they were freshmen at Yale.
Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a Yale alum, showed up for the on-campus protests and addressed the students.
“There is no way that the U.S. Senate, in good conscience, can vote on this nomination without a full investigation,"" Blumenthal told them.
What did the school say about it?Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken issued a statement supporting the students' calls for a thorough investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. From the Courant:
“Students have worked with the Law School administration and faculty so that the community can come together as a whole to discuss this important moment in our country’s history,’’ she said in a statement released by Yale Law School.(H/T Hot Air)

        Sen. Jeff Flake says he got death threats after asking Senate to hold hearing for Kavanaugh accuser
    Speaking on the floor of the Senate, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) called out people on both sides of the political spectrum who had levied threats against or slandered both Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.
He also revealed that he and his family had received death threats after he urged the Senate to hear Ford's testimony.
According to a CNN report from Sept. 20, Kavanaugh and Ford have received “a slew of death threats” since they entered the public arena.
What did he say?Addressing his colleagues in the Senate, Flake said:
I will not review the unseemly process that brought us to this point, because that is for another time. And, in any case, it didn't start with this particular nomination. But here we are.
There was an earlier case, 27 years ago, from which you might have thought we would have learned something. But the past couple of weeks makes it clear that we haven't learned much at all.Flake also addressed the threats against himself and his family. He revealed that a man ""somewhere in the country"" had called Flake's Arizona office and criticized him for ""interrupting my president."" Flake continued:
In the same speech, Flake also called President Donald Trump “uninformed and uncaring"" for saying that Ford's story lacked credibility because she did not immediately report it when she was 15. Trump had said that if the incident “was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities.”

        Ed Whelan takes leave of absence from Ethics and Public Policy Center following Kavanaugh tweets
    Ed Whelan ""will take a leave of absence"" from his role as president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, the organization announced Sunday.
EPPC's board is set to reconvene in a month while it reviews the situation surrounding a series of tweets by Whelan last week. In the Twitter thread, Whelan alleged that Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had mistaken Kavanaugh for someone else during the alleged attack.
What happened?In the tweets, which Whelan has since deleted, he first promised, ""By one week from today, I expect that Judge Kavanaugh will have been clearly vindicated in this matter. Specifically, I expect that compelling evidence will show his categorical denial to be truthful.""
He then followed up by tweeting, ""Okay, I'll begin laying out some information concerning Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.""
Whelan went on to post floor plans of a house that corresponds to descriptions Ford gave of the night of the alleged attack. Whelan said it might have been the location where Kavanaugh reportedly assaulted her during a party 35 years ago.
Whelan also tweeted the name and photo of one of Kavanaugh's high school classmates — posting side-by-side photos of the two to show their resemblance — while alleging that the man was a possible suspect and that Ford has mistakenly recalled Kavanaugh as the perpetrator.
He concluded, ""To be clear, I have no idea what, if anything, did or did not happen in that bedroom at the top of the stairs, and I therefore do not state, imply or insinuate that [Kavanaugh's classmate] or anyone else committed the sexual assault that Ford alleges.""
What are others saying?In response to the tweets, Daily Wire editor Ben Shapiro summed up the reaction of many others when he posted simply, ""Dude what are you doing?""
Dude what are you doing https://t.co/pJ78Ghtt90— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) September 20, 2018Rod Dreher of The American Conservative wrote in a piece titled, ""Ed Whelan's Crackpot Theory,"" that ""It is inconceivable that this Whelan defense will help Kavanaugh in any way. In fact, it's so nasty and desperate-seeming that it taints Kavanaugh, despite the fact that he might have had nothing to do with it.""
Dreher went on to echo the sentiments of other critics who slammed Whelan for posting the ""poor man's name and photos,"" referring to Kavanaugh's classmate.
Ford issued a statement responding to Whelan's theory to the Washington Post, saying, ""I knew them both, and socialized with [the other classmate]. ... There is zero chance that I would confuse them.""
What's with the leave of absence?In a statement released Sunday, EPPC's board of directors said:
After deliberation, the board declined to accept Mr. Whelan's resignation, but determined that he will take a leave of absence from the organization during which time Yuval Levin, EPPC's Vice President and Hertog Fellow, will be in charge. The board will meet in a month to review the situation.What did Whelan say?Whelan also released a statement on Sunday, saying:
I also apologize to the victims of sexual assault and to Dr. Ford for these and other tweets that did not address with respectful consideration the difficult question of how to assess allegations of sexual assault.
I do not believe that all such allegations must be accepted as true, and I believe further that the usual inquiries into motivation, cognition, memory and other matters that apply to other charges properly apply to these as well. But my tweets did not advance the discussion in a constructive way.

        Ronan Farrow admits second Kavanaugh accuser only came forward after Senate Dems 'began looking
    Investigative reporter Ronan Farrow, who helped break a second story of alleged sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, admitted Monday the accuser's story was only investigated after Senate Democrats ""began looking"" for new dirt on Kavanaugh.
Farrow and longtime New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer published a bombshell story Sunday night detailing new allegations from a woman who attended Yale with Kavanaugh. She claims that during a party, in which she herself was drunk, Kavanaugh exposed himself to her.
The New Yorker and the New York Times, in a separate investigation, was unable to find a single corroborating witness. Kavanaugh denies the claim, characterizing it as ""a smear, plain and simple.""
What did Farrow say?During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America,"" Farrow confirmed the fears of many Republicans — that Kavanaugh is the victim of a well-orchestrated smear campaign meant to derail his Supreme Court nomination — admitting the second accuser only came forward after Democrats snooped for additional dirt on Kavanaugh.
""She came forward because Senate Democrats began looking at this claim. She did not flag this for those Democrats. This came to the attention of people on The Hill independently, and it's really cornered her into an awkward position,"" Farrow said.
""She said, point-blank, 'I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life,' but she feels this is a serious claim. She considers her own memories credible and she felt it was important that she tell her own story before others did without her consent,"" he explained.
Prior to Farrow's admission, Stephanopoulos asked the reporter how the accuser's accusations could be credible if just last week she was questioning their legitimacy due to heavy drinking and holes in her memory. The ABC host said the revelation ""jumped out"" at him.
Farrow responded that unreliable memory is ""extremely typical of these stories when you are dealing with trauma, alcohol, many years in between.""
""The more cautious witnesses that I have dealt with in cases like this very frequently say, 'I want to take time to decide, I want to talk to other people involved, I want to search myself and make sure that I can affirmatively stand by these claims' in the face of what she knew would be a crucible of partisan pushback, which is what she is receiving now,"" he said.

        WATCH: Jake Tapper corners top anti-Kavanaugh Democrat on abuse hypocrisy. Here's her response.
    Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono (D) told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday that she doesn't believe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is innocent of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, which she characterized as ""attempted rape,"" because she disagrees with some of his judicial rulings.
What happened?During ""State of the Union,"" Tapper asked Hirono if Kavanaugh deserves the same presumption of innocence on which the American criminal justice system is built.
She responded:
I put [Kavanaugh's] denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases. As I've said, his credibility is already very questionable in my mind and in the minds of my fellow Judiciary Committee members, the Democrats. And when I say he is very outcome-driven, he has an ideological agenda that's very outcome-driven, and I can sit here and talk to you about some of the cases that exemplifies his, in my view, inability to be fair in the cases that come before him.
This is a person that is gonna be sitting on our Supreme Court, making decisions that will impact women's reproductive choice. He very much is against reproductive choice. ... So there are so many indications of his own lack of credibility.When Tapper followed up, asking Hirono if she actually just said she doesn't believe Kavanaugh's denials because of his views on policy, the Hawaii Democrat deflected, and instead underscored the importance of an ""independent investigation.""
""You think Kavanaugh is lying though, that's what you're saying?"" Tapper followed up.
""Well, I believe [Christine Ford], let's put it that way,"" Hirono responded.
According to multiple reports, it is very unlikely that the FBI will pursue an investigation against Kavanaugh, especially given the lack of evidence to corroborate the claims against him.
Anything else?Earlier in the interview, Hirono trashed Kavanaugh for what she described as long existing ""credibility"" issues.
""Even before all of this happened, he had credibility issues in his testimony, three days of testimony,"" she told Tapper. ""He's very outcome-driven in terms of how he views cases before him. And so I had issues with his credibility and how he went about things way before this even happened.""
Tapper later confronted Hirono with an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that targeted her for placing a presumption of guilt on Kavanaugh. Tapper quoted:
Sexual allegations should be accepted as true merely by having been made. The accuser is presumably telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. This turns American justice and due process upside down.Hirono responded: ""If the Wall Street Journal really cares about due process, I'd say that they should care that there is no independent investigation of these allegations. I think that this kind of attitude is what makes it really difficult for victims and survivors of these kinds of traumatic events to even come forward.""

        Tentative deal reached for Kavanaugh accuser to testify, then party 'witness' drops major statement
    Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, has agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Thursday.
Meanwhile, the fourth person who Ford claims was at the party, where she alleges Kavanaugh assaulted her, said late Saturday she has no recollection of being at the party.
What are the details?The New York Times reported Ford's attorneys, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, reached a tentative agreement with the committee sometime Saturday evening. The deal was reached Saturday after Ford's attorneys announced their client had agreed to provide her testimony to the committee.
The terms under which Ford will testify are not yet ironed out. Ford's attorneys planned to continue negotiations with aides for Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Sunday. According to the Times, aides for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, are also involved in negotiations.
The Associated Press reported that Kavanaugh is also expected to testify Thursday.
Additional details yet to be determined include the order of testimony — Ford originally demanded that Kavanaugh go first — and who will do the questioning. Ford insists it be senators, while some Republicans say outside counsel, even a female lawyer, should do the questioning.
Still, Grassley and other Republican members of the committee have remained open to making Ford as comfortable as possible given the situation. In the end, it's just her testimony they want so they can move forward with Kavanaugh's confirmation.
What about the other person?Leland Keyser, the fourth person Ford alleges was at the party, came forward Saturday to say she ""does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present,"" according to a letter her lawyer sent the Judiciary Committee, the Washington Post reported.
The development is significant because now all four people who Ford alleges attended the small house party in 1982, including Kavanaugh, say they have no recollection of being at the party or seeing Kavanaugh there.
Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal explains:
1) Breaking, and a big deal: Fourth person that Ford named as present at infamous event denies even knowing kavanaugh, much less ever attending a party where he was present.Statement from Leland Keyser's attorney: ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.""So to be clear: All four people named have said this party never happened. It isn't even as if one of them is saying, ""oh, i remember the party, but my memory of how things played out is different."" They are saying it NEVER HAPPENED.  That is powerful evidence.And BTW, where does that put all those folks who claim the new standard is that we must automatically ""believe"" women? Because here is a woman, and she is saying Ford has it wrong.

        GoFundMe accounts raise $700,000 on behalf of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford
    College professor Christine Blasey Ford testified Thursday before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982. During her testimony, Ford mentioned that a number of GoFundMe sites have raised funds on her behalf.
What did she say?""I'm aware that there's been several GoFundMe sites,"" Blasey Ford told Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor who was hired by the GOP majority to ask questions at the hearing. ""I haven't had a chance to figure out how to manage those because I've never had one.""
She made the statement after Mitchell asked her how she would pay for her polygraph test and other costs associated with her testimony against Kavanaugh.
GoFundMe has more than a dozen fundraisers on the site that mention Blasey Ford by name. The crowdfunding website allows anyone to launch a fundraiser. The top two campaigns alone have brought in a total of nearly $700,000.
At the time of this writing, various GoFundMe pages for Blasey Ford have raised money on her behalf as follows:
 	 	 	 	Other fundraisers that list her name have raised little to no money.
The text on the top fundraising campaign says:
Christine is Palo Alto mom, a beloved professor and mentor and friend. This fundraiser is sponsored by her neighbors and colleagues. She is truly grateful for your support!
Please note that we will not withdraw any of these funds. The family has been named the sole beneficiary and her husband will take the funds directly from GoFundMe.
Anything else?A GoFundMe account called Christine Blasey Ford is seeking to raise money to look into her background.
The page states:
Please help me in the cause I will be working with private investigators to expose the truth and funding of this campaign to destroy a man. I will also be hire forensic accounting investigators to track down any payments.By Friday morning, the fundraiser received one donation of $20.

        Grassley grants Kavanaugh accuser another extension after her lawyer sends very hostile letter
    Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) agreed late Friday to grant Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s, additional time to decide if she will testify before his committee.
What did Grassley say?He explained on Twitter:


In an earlier tweet, Grassley lamented over the complicated process. He urged Ford to testify before the committee, but to decide quickly so the committee can proceed with Kavanaugh's confirmation process.
The extension comes after Grassley earlier gave Ford a Friday deadline of 5 p.m. However, he extended the deadline to 10 p.m. after Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, called the ""cavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor ... completely inappropriate.""
Within minutes of the new 10 p.m. deadline, Katz released a new letter characterizing the deadline as ""arbitrary"" while demanding it be extended.
""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-alterating implications for her and her family,"" Katz claimed.
When is the new deadline?According to CNN, the committee has given Ford until 2:30 p.m. on Saturday to inform them of her final decision.

        GOP senator, a key Kavanaugh swing vote, was 'appalled' by Trump's sexual assault tweet
    Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was not pleased with President Donald Trump's tweet about Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, Politico reported.
Collins is one of a handful of undecided Republican senators whose vote could be crucial in determining whether Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court.
Trump on Friday morning asked on Twitter why Ford didn't call the FBI when the alleged sexual assault took place 36 years ago if the attack ""was as bad as she says.""

""I was appalled by the president's tweet,"" Collins said, according to an audio recording provided to Politico by her office. ""I thought that the president's tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong.""
Why did Collins take issue?Collins pointed out that many victims of sexual assault and harassment don't come forward immediately, for a variety of reasons, meaning that a delay in reporting doesn't necessarily mean the accusation is untrue.
""We know that allegations of sexual assault -- I'm not saying that's what happened in this case -- but we know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,"" Collins said.
Where does Collins stand on Kavanaugh?Collins has met with Kavanaugh, but she has not tipped her hand one way or the other about how she plans to vote.
As for the allegation of sexual assault against the judge, Collins said she believes Ford needs to testify, but she would be fine if that hearing was delayed until Wednesday or Thursday to accommodate Ford. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has maintained that Ford needs to show up at a scheduled Monday hearing.
Collins has been under significant pressure due to her status as a moderate who could go either way on Kavanaugh. A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than a million dollars that it will donate to her 2020 opponent if she votes for Kavanaugh, and she has received angry messages and threats throughout this process.

        Kavanaugh and his accuser to testify next week before Senate Judiciary Committee
    A confirmation vote that was once thought to be a safe bet for Republicans will be put to its toughest test yet next Monday when Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing him of sexual assault, both testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The New York Times reported that Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the committee, told senators that they would get the chance to hear from both parties before a confirmation vote.
Senators on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns about voting for Kavanaugh in light of allegations against the judge, maximizing the stakes for Kavanaugh, Republicans and Ford.
""Obviously if Judge Kavanaugh has lied about what happened, that would be disqualifying,"" Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters. ""For my part, I believe it's very important that both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testify under oath about these allegations. I need to see them and listen to their answers to the questions in order to make an assessment.""
Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, accused Kavanaugh of groping her and attempting to remove her clothing by force when they were both in high school and at a party. Kavanaugh immediately and completely denied the allegation.
Shades of Clarence Thomas?Some have already drawn the comparison of Kavanaugh's situation to that of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991. Thomas was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill. Hill testified before Thomas's confirmation vote, but that testimony didn't shift public opinion against Thomas, who was confirmed 52-48.
FiveThirtyEight notes that Thomas's hearings took place in a much different cultural context than Kavanaugh's, however. Polling even shows that in the years after Hill's testimony against Thomas, the public began viewing sexual harassment as a bigger problem than they did before:
The increased sensitivity to sexual misconduct issues in 2018 as compared to 1991, in addition to Kavanaugh's relative unpopularity compared to Thomas's at the time of his nomination, indicate that next week's testimonies could have massive impact on Kavanaugh's future.

        Should this be disqualifying?' NYT writer faces harsh backlash for Kavanaugh comments
    A New York Times opinion writer was harshly criticized after questioning whether Judge Brett Kavanaugh should be disqualified from the Supreme Court nomination for something he may have done as a teenager during an MSNBC appearance.
The writer, Bari Weiss, said she believed accuser Christine Blasey Ford was sincere but also suggested that maybe Kavanaugh should still be confirmed even if Ford's sexual assault allegation is true.
""What about the deeper, moral, cultural ... the ethical question here?"" Weiss said to Stephanie Ruhle on MSNBC. ""Let's say he did this exactly as she said. Should the fact that a 17-year-old, presumably very drunk kid, did this, should this be disqualifying? That's the question at the end of the day, isn't it?""Why did she say that?Weiss said that she was hesitant to disqualify Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court nomination over this allegation based on his past character and the lack of a pattern of this kind of behavior.
""The whole thing in all these instances is that there has been a sustained pattern,"" Weiss said, referring to past sexual misconduct cases such as that of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. ""The ones that have stuck, there has been a pattern. By all accounts, other than this instance, Brett Kavanaugh has a reputation as a prince of a man, other than this.
""I believe her. I believe what she's saying. But at the end of the day, it is one word against another,"" Weiss concluded.

The backlashSome of the feedback against Weiss focused on the distinction of this being a Supreme Court confirmation, not a criminal proceeding. In summary, Weiss's critics point out that being appointed to the nation's highest court for life is not a right.
""It is perfectly consistent to believe that nobody's life should be ruined for committing a crime at age 17 — and that any adult who lies about that crime should not be elevated to the Supreme Court,"" lawyer Mark Joseph Stern wrote for Slate, pointing out that by saying she believes Ford, Weiss is also saying that Kavanaugh has lied in his denials.Others on social media also expressed disapproval of Weiss's MSNBC comments:

        Kavanaugh vehemently denies assault claims, is willing to testify before the Senate again
    Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is adamant that he did not sexually assault a woman when they were in their teens.
Kavanaugh is so determined to underscore his denial that he is now willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee once again.
What's the background?A woman — later identified as California professor Christine Blasey Ford — accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an incident that allegedly took place in the early 1980s.
The information was delivered in letters to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July — shortly after President Donald Trump chose Kavanaugh as his nominee for Supreme Court justice.
The information only became public as a result of a Friday report in The New Yorker.
Feinstein said she turned the letter over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee later issued a statement on the letter and the way she handled the communication.
“That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision,” Feinstein said.
According to Ford's letter, she had attended a house party with Kavanaugh and others at a Maryland home in the '80s. Ford alleged that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom along with another male companion. Kavanaugh then allegedly locked the door, put on loud music to muffle any sound, and reportedly attempted to remove her clothing.
Ford said that Kavanaugh and his male friend were drunk and laughing. At one point, Ford said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to keep her from crying out. She later revealed that she thought he might inadvertently kill her during the alleged interaction.
The other male reportedly jumped on Kavanaugh at one point, and she was able to free herself. She reportedly left the party and went home. All three parties were minors when the alleged incident occurred.
Ford, now 51, said she believes that the alleged incident led her to develop anxiety and PTSD.
What did Kavanaugh say?In a Friday statement, Kavanaugh denied Ford's accusations.
“I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” Kavanaugh said.
In a statement Friday from the White House, spokesperson Kerri Kupec said, “Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators — including with Sen. Feinstein — sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new ‘information’ about him.”
On Friday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a letter that was signed by 65 women who knew Kavanaugh while in high school.
A portion of the letter read, “Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day.”
What did Feinstein say?On Sunday, Feinstein said that the FBI should conduct a thorough investigation before the Senate votes on Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
In a statement, Feinstein said, “I support Mrs. Ford’s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.”
What's happening now?During Monday's ""CBS This Morning,"" Debra Katz, the attorney representing Ford, said that her client would be willing to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in an attempt to prove her allegations are valid.
“My client will do whatever is necessary to make sure that the Senate Judiciary Committee has the full story and the full set of allegations to allow them to make a fully informed decision. She’s willing to do what she needs to do,” Katz said.
On Monday, Kavanaugh fired back with his own statement, and proclaimed that he would also be willing to testify.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,” Kavanaugh said, according to a New York Times report Monday.
White House spokesperson Kupec also issued a Monday statement, which read, “On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation. This has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.”Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Donald Trump, said that she had spoken with the president and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and that the woman “will be heard.”
“We hope that this hearing is fair and not another weaponized attack on a woman who has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against a powerful man,” Katz told the Times.

        Democrats seize on accusations against Kavanaugh, demand delay in confirmation vote
    Democrats have opposed Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination from the minute President Donald Trump made it official. They may now have the ammunition they need to completely derail Kavanaugh's confirmation.
The development comes after the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct against her in the early 1980s, when they were both teenagers, went public in an interview with the Washington Post Sunday.
What are Democrats saying?Top Senate Democrats are calling for Kavanaugh's confirmation vote to be delayed now that there is a real human — 51-year-old Christine Blasey Ford, who is a professor at Palo Alto University — behind the sexual misconduct allegations. Some are even calling for the FBI to investigate the claims.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: ""I support Mrs. Ford’s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said: ""For too long, when women have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored. That cannot happen in this case. Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility has already been seriously questioned. ... To railroad a vote now would be an insult to the women of America and the integrity of the Supreme Court.""
Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said: ""The allegations contained in the Washington Post report about Judge Brett Kavanaugh are serious, credible, and deeply troubling. At a bare minimum, this week’s scheduled committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court must be postponed until this matter is fully and thoroughly investigated.""
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) said: ""Christine Blasey Ford courageously stepped forward to tell her story — it is a credible and serious allegation. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to scrutinize SCOTUS nominees. A vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination must be delayed until there is a thorough investigation.""
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said: ""Rather than outright dismissing this very serious allegation, or releasing a premeditated defense of the allegation via a letter from former classmates, Republicans should postpone the rush to vote on Kavanaugh this week and investigate these allegations in a bipartisan manner. Shame on the Senate if they don’t take this seriously, especially before moving forward on a lifetime appointment.""
The initial Senate vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation had already been delayed once. It is now scheduled for Sept. 20.
What are Republicans saying?Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley (R), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it was ""disturbing"" that ""uncorroborated allegations"" from the early 1980s surface ""on the eve of a committee vote after Democrats sat on them since July.""
""The committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination will proceed as scheduled, next Thurs. Here’s what we know: Judge Kavanaugh has undergone six FBI full-field investigations from 1993 to 2018. No such allegation resembling the anonymous claims ever surfaced,"" Grassley said.
Other Republicans, however, exercised more caution. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), long believed to be a key swing vote, said she will be ""talking with my colleagues."" Still, Collins expressed frustration over the timeliness of the allegations. Democrats ""have managed to cast a cloud of doubt on both the professor and the judge,"" she told the New York Times.
Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R) took a more hardline stance. ""For me, we can’t vote until we hear more,"" he told a Washington Post reporter on Sunday.
Anything else?Debra Katz, the Washington attorney representing Ford, said Monday on ""CBS This Morning"" that her client is willing to testify the validity of her allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""My client will do whatever is necessary to make sure that the Senate Judiciary Committee has the full story and the full set of allegations to allow them to make a fully informed decision. She's willing to do what she needs to do,"" Katz said.

        Celebrities team up to film viral video of support for Kavanaugh accuser: ‘Dear Professor Ford ...’
    Female celebrities have taken the initiative in banding together to support Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s.
The celebrities, as well as other women in the U.S., teamed up and recorded a video of support and solidarity for a woman they call their sister.
What's the background?California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an incident that she said took place in the early 1980s when the two were high school students.
Ford, now 51, delivered the information in a letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July, shortly after Trump chose Kavanaugh as the nominee for Supreme Court justice. Feinstein — the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee — eventually turned the letter over to the FBI.
According to Ford’s account, she attended a house party with Kavanaugh and other teens at a Maryland home in 1982. Ford wrote that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom along with another male companion. Kavanaugh then allegedly locked the door, put on loud music to muffle any sounds, and reportedly attempted to remove Ford’s clothing.
Ford said that Kavanaugh and his male friend, who were reportedly drunk, laughed. At one point, Ford said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to keep her from making any noises. She later revealed that she thought he might inadvertently kill her during the alleged incident.
Kavanaugh flatly denied Ford’s allegations: “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
According to her lawyer, Ford is willing to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh has said that he is also willing to testify again in front of the committee.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,” Kavanaugh said Monday.
The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Kavanaugh. The committee also set a Monday hearing that requests Ford and Kavanaugh to testify publicly.Ford now says that she does not plan to testify until the FBI investigates her allegations.What's in the video?Celebrities like Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, and Gabrielle Union — among other women — filmed the video in support of Ford.
The video, which was produced by MoveOn, featured the women saying, “Dear Professor Ford, we know how difficult it is to stand up to powerful people. We want to thank you for publicly sharing your story of sexual violence.“The behavior you described was wrong and runs directly counter to upholding the law and promoting justice. He should not be confirmed,” the women in the video added.
“We applaud your courage in coming forward for the public good and we will be with you as you face the inevitable backlash,” the women continued. “You are strong. And you are not alone.”The video concluded, “You are a survivor and millions of us have your back. You and your testimony are credible. We believe you. Signed, Your Sisters.”
#DearProfessorFord, your sisters have a message for you: we believe you. We call on Senators to demand a full, fair and trauma-informed investigation. pic.twitter.com/Of32UZ6JFx— Julianne Moore (@_juliannemoore) September 19, 2018

        NV-Sen: Heller confident Kavanaugh will get past 'little hiccup' sex assault allegations
    Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) referred to the sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as a ""little hiccup"" that he believes the judge will be able to overcome, according to The Nevada Independent.
Heller's confidence in the confirmation stands out among his colleagues who have taken much more of a ""wait-and-see"" approach to a situation that has changed quickly over the past week. He made the comment on a Nevada Republican Party-arranged conference call Wednesday.
“I’m really grateful for the White House, for the effort of President Trump and what he has done, and the excitement that we have,” Heller said. “We got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we’ll get through this and we’ll get off to the races,” he said.
Why did he say that?Heller was an early supporter of Kavanaugh's nomination, endorsing the judge shortly after meeting with him in July.
""His legal career combined with his educational credentials make him an exceptionally qualified nominee to fill the upcoming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Heller said in his endorsement.
Heller still believes all the information should come out on this situation, as he said in a statement to Victor Joecks of the Las Vegas Review Journal.
""I think it is important for Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford to share her information with the Judiciary Committee,"" Heller said in the statement. ""Given the gravity of this appointment and this accusation, I would hope all Senators, regardless of party, will work with Chairman Grassley in good faith.""
Rosen jumps on the commentHeller's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, criticized Heller for his characterization of the allegation against Kavanaugh.
""Unbelievable: Senator Heller just dismissed a credible sexual assault allegation as a 'hiccup,' -- and predicted Kavanaugh will still be confirmed soon."" Rosen tweeted.
""Apparently Senator Heller still has 'no reservations' about voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,"" Rosen wrote later. ""Nevadans deserve so much better.""

Heller attempted to clarify his words Thursday, saying he does ""not believe sexual assault allegation of any kind are a hiccup,"" according to The New York Times.

        Trump speaks out on Kavanaugh accusation: Delay is not a problem; idea of withdrawal is 'ridiculous
    President Donald Trump spoke about the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, noting that the very idea of Kavanaugh withdrawing as a result of them is ""ridiculous.""
What's the background?California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an incident that she said took place in the early 1980s when the two were high school students.
Ford, now 51 years old, delivered the information in a letter to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July, almost immediately after Trump chose Kavanaugh as nominee for Supreme Court justice. Feinstein — the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee — eventually turned the letter over to the FBI.
According to Ford’s account, she attended a house party with Kavanaugh and other teens at a Maryland home in 1982. Ford wrote that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom along with another male companion. Kavanaugh then allegedly locked the door, put on loud music to muffle any sounds, and reportedly attempted to remove Ford's clothing.
Ford said that Kavanaugh and his male friend, who were reportedly drunk, laughed. At one point, Ford said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to keep her from making any noises. She later revealed that she thought he might accidentally kill her during the alleged incident.
In a statement Friday, Kavanaugh flatly denied Ford’s allegations.
“I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” Kavanaugh said.
According to her lawyer, Ford is willing to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh has said that he is also willing to testify again in front of the committee.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,” Kavanaugh added on Monday.
What did Trump say?On Monday, Trump said that the very idea of Kavanaugh's nomination being withdrawn is ""ridiculous.""
“If it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay,” Trump explained. “I’m sure it will work out very well.”
He added that the hearings would continue, but appeared to express frustration with Democrats over the issue, as Feinstein and Eshoo had the letter since July.
“With all of that being said, we want to go through the process,” he said, later adding that he wished “Democrats could have done this a lot sooner.”
Trump called Kavanaugh a ""very special guy"" who had ""never even had a little blemish on his record.""
""He's one of the great intellects, and one of the finest people that anybody has known. You look at his references. I've never seen anything quite like it,"" the president added.
Trump: ""Judge Kavanaugh is one of the finest people that I've ever known,"" says Kavanaugh has ""never had even a little blemish on his record."" Then adds: ""with all of it being said, we want to go through a full process."" (via Bloomberg) pic.twitter.com/DsUTNm9DaW— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 17, 2018Anything more from Kavanaugh?In new Monday statements, Kavanaugh reportedly said that he wasn't even at the party in question.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told NBC News that he felt Ford is simply ""mixed up."" Like the president, Hatch also had praise for the nominee, calling him ""honest"" and ""straightforward.""
According to the outlet, Hatch's aide said that Kavanaugh, while on the phone with the senator, denied having even been at the party in question.
NBC News reported that a White House official confirmed the remark that Kavanaugh said he hadn't attended such a party.

        Kavanaugh accuser Ford won't testify without FBI investigation first, her lawyers say
    Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused federal judge and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, will not testify publicly about the alleged incident unless a ""full investigation by law enforcement officials"" is completed beforehand, according to her attorneys.
Ford's legal team sent a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that letter was obtained by CNN.
""...a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions,"" the letter read.
What changed?This situation has developed quickly since Friday. As of Monday night, it appeared Ford was willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next Monday, along with Kavanaugh. By Tuesday morning, however, that appearance was in doubt as Grassley said they had not been able to get in touch with Ford.
Now, echoing calls from Democrats for an FBI investigation, Ford and her lawyers are pumping the brakes on any potential hearing next week.
""Asking her to come forward in four or five days and sit before the Judiciary Committee on national TV is not a fair process,"" Ford attorney Lisa Banks said to CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""If they care about doing the right thing here and treating this seriously as they have said, then they will do the right thing and they will properly investigate this, and she will work with them in that investigation and also to share her story with the committee.""
Sen. Grassley is not budgingDespite this new demand from Ford's side, Grassley believes that the Monday hearing should go on as originally planned, and that there is no need for an FBI investigation.
""Dr. Ford's testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events,"" Grassley said. ""Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr. Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay.""
Grassley made it clear that his invitation for Ford to testify Monday ""still stands.""
According to the Justice Department, Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh don't involve a potential federal crime, and The Hill reported that no investigation has been opened.
""The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation,"" a DOJ statement read. ""The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States. ... The FBI's role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.""

        The attorney who represents Andrew McCabe just joined Kavanaugh accuser's legal team
    Former federal prosecutor Michael Bromwich, who represents former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, has joined the legal team representing Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the early 1980s.
What are the details?""I’m honored to be joining Debra Katz and Lisa Banks in representing Dr. Ford,"" Bromwich wrote on Twitter Saturday afternoon.

The news came after Katz and Banks released a letter Saturday announcing Ford had accepted the invitation to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She will likely testify sometime next week.
According to Law&Crime, Bromwich's strategic consulting firm, The Bromwich Group, is also joining Ford's team.
However, before he could officially join Ford's team, Bromwich was forced to resign his position as senior counsel at the Washington-based law firm Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck, Untereiner & Sauber, according to Law.com.
Bromwich wrote in a resignation letter to the firm:
Within the past few days, I have been asked to serve as one of Christine Blasey Ford’s attorneys. My role will likely require me to appear publicly on Dr. Ford’s behalf, and the Senate is being advised of my involvement this afternoon. Because objections have been raised within the partnership to my doing so while employed by the firm, I am resigning from the firm, effective immediately.
This obviously is happening on a schedule that could not be anticipated. I will have time to say my less rushed goodbyes over the next several weeks.In addition to working as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Bromwich served as inspector general of the Department of Justice from 1994-1999. And in 2010, then-President Barack Obama appointed him to be director of the newly created Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

        Credited course to attend Kavanaugh protest in DC offered by retired prof at public college. Oops.
    A recently retired professor at the University of Southern Maine offered students a “pop-up” credited course to take a bus to Washington, D.C., with demonstrators planning to urge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to vote against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the Press Herald reported.
University officials found out Wednesday afternoon that Susan Feiner, a former professor of economics and women and gender studies, had asked another university employee to advertise the trip on social media, the paper said, adding that the bus to D.C. left Portland at 9 p.m. Wednesday.

How did school officials react?“This pop-up course was hastily arranged in the past 24 hours, without the knowledge of the provost or myself. It was not appropriately reviewed nor went through proper channels,” President Glenn Cummings said in a statement to the Press Herald. “As soon as the provost and I were apprised of the course, we immediately pulled the one-credit offering. We also made sure that no USM monies were being used for the trip.”
Feiner — who Cummings said retired July 1 — told the paper she works at the Francis Perkins Institute at USM, which organizes pop-up courses funded by a grant and offered free to students. Her goal is to offer six to 12 pop-up courses each semester, the paper noted.
“Dr. Feiner acted in a very rogue manner,"" Cummings added to the Press Herald. ""Her behavior was inappropriate. It was unacceptable.”
What are 'pop-up' courses?Pop-up courses offer credits that can count toward the 120 credit hours required for graduation, the paper said, adding that they don’t usually last for more than few weeks. One pop-up example is Uncovering Black History in Maine, which began Sept. 27 and requires students to attend two events and three class meetings, the Press Herald said.
How did the state GOP react?The Maine Republican Party ripped the pop-up course.
""The University of Southern Maine uses your tax dollars, offers college credit to protest Sen. Collins in Washington D.C.,"" the organization wrote on its Facebook page, adding an image of an email about the course from Gabriel Demaine — who the Press Herald said is a ""Social Justice Community Outreach Organizer for USM’s Geography and Anthropology Department.""
 Image source: Facebook
The email in question links to an online form asking students if they’re willing to be arrested, the paper added:
 Image source: Facebook
Cummings told the Press Herald it was his understanding that Feiner asked Demaine to promote the event on social media.
What else are school officials saying?“University policy makes it absolutely clear that our public, taxpayer funded institutions must be non-partisan in terms of political activity and institutionally impartial in all political, religious, and social matters that are unrelated to our universities’ core mission of education, research and public service,” Cummings added to the paper.
James Page, chancellor of the University of Maine System, also wasn't too happy with the turn of events.
“The use of institutional resources to advance a partisan agenda violates board policies established to ensure Maine’s public universities remain non-partisan and politically neutral,” Page said in a statement, the Press Herald said. “Inviting arrest for college credit goes much further, violating the trust our students, their families, and Maine taxpayers have placed in our universities and could result in serious professional consequences.”
What did the prof behind the course have to say?Feiner was interviewed on the bus bound for Washington, D.C., and told the paper students would act as observers, not protesters, and that all students — regardless of their opinion of Kavanaugh — were invited to ride the bus.
“We’re not inviting them to protest,” Feiner added to the Press Herald. “There was never a dime’s worth of university or taxpayer money involved.”

And while defending the course, she took the blame for not going through the proper channels.
“I have to confess that because I was the person who wrote the grant I did not fill out the form. I was going to type it up on the bus,” Feiner told the paper. “It is on me.""
She added to the Press Herald that ""it's terrible to deny students such an incredible learning opportunity. Social justice is not a partisan issue. There is nothing seditious about students taking a bus to Washington, D.C., in a historic moment. Their senator is in the epicenter of it.”
What now?Cummings told the paper he's uncertain if or how Feiner could be disciplined since ""she is not teaching here.""
Some students said they supported the course even thought it went against school policy, NECN-TV reported.
“Every college should take a stand,” student Mustfa Kadhim told the station. “We have to support women.”
But not every student agreed.
“I feel like there’s a time and a place for protesting,” Ian Trumpler told NECN. “I feel like it shouldn’t be run through the school. That’s an easy credit for the kids, but kind of crazy for a professor to offer.""
Here's a clip of Feiner discussing the course:

        Brett Kavanaugh accuser breaks silence, details stunning allegations: 'I thought he might...kill me
    The woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct broke her silence for the first time in an interview with the Washington Post published Sunday.
What are the details?Christine Blasey Ford, a 51-year-old professor who teaches clinical psychology at Palo Alto University, described an incident she alleges happened during a small house party in Montgomery County, Maryland, in the summer of 1982.
Ford said an intoxicated Kavanaugh ""pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it. When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth,"" according to the Post.
""I thought he might inadvertently kill me,"" Ford said. ""He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.""
Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, jumped on the bed, sending all three tumbling. She said she locked herself in a bathroom until she heard the two boys leave. She then left the house, but does not remember how she returned home. She told the Post the alleged attack left her terrified, but she vowed to herself at the time that she would not tell anyone what had happened. 
At the time, she feared what her parents would say if they knew she had been at a party where there was alcohol. Ford was 15 at the time. Kavanaugh was 17.
""My biggest fear was, do I look like someone just attacked me?” Ford said, adding that she recalled thinking: “I’m not ever telling anyone this. This is nothing, it didn’t happen, and he didn’t rape me.""
More from the Post:
Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband. The therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.” The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.
Notes from an individual therapy session the following year, when she was being treated for what she says have been long-term effects of the incident, show Ford described a “rape attempt” in her late teens.Ford said she believes the incident is responsible for her anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.
On the advice of her lawyer, Washington attorney Debra Katz, Ford took a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent in early August. Katz said the lie-detector test was necessary because she would be attacked as a liar if she ever went public with her allegations. According to the Post, Ford passed the test.
Ford initially sought to keep her identity private. But as the media pressed the matter further, even showing up at her place of employment, Ford said she knew the can of worms had been opened — and there was no way it would be closed ever again.
""These are all the ills that I was trying to avoid,"" she said. ""Now I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.""
Anything else?California Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday the FBI should conduct a thorough investigation before the Senate votes on Kavanaugh's confirmation.
""I support Mrs. Ford’s decision to share her story, and now that she has, it is in the hands of the FBI to conduct an investigation. This should happen before the Senate moves forward on this nominee,"" Feinstein said.

        Prosecutor who questioned Ford said she wouldn't prosecute Kavanaugh based on evidence she heard
    The Arizona prosecutor who questioned Christine Blasey Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday told Republican senators after the hearing that she wouldn't have prosecuted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh based on evidence she heard, the Washington Post reported, citing an individual familiar with the prosecutor's comments.
Rachel Mitchell was chosen by the GOP to question Ford, who has claimed Kavanaugh sexual assaulted her when they were teenagers in 1982.

The office of Republican Sen. John Cornyn (Texas) on Friday sent a news release referring to Mitchell's conclusion, USA Today said.
Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, told Fox News Friday morning he believed Mitchell ""did a good job getting the basic facts out"" in questioning Ford.
“I spent 13 years as a judge back in Texas, and I recognize the need to have somebody who does this for a living day after day carefully question somebody who has claimed to be a victim of sexual assault,"" Cornyn said, adding he doesn't regret using Mitchell.
Here's a clip of Cornyn's comments. After discussing votes needed to get Kavanaugh out of committee and before the Senate for a final vote, he talks about Mitchell's performance just after the 2-minute mark:

'An unmitigated disaster'Not everyone agreed with Cornyn regarding Mitchell, however.
Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano reportedly said Ford ""is extremely credible, and Rachel Mitchell is not laying a glove on her.""

""The president cannot be happy with this,"" Napolitano, a Trump supporter, reportedly added.
Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, is no Trump supporter and agreed with the Mitchell assessment:

And a Republican strategist close to the White House told Business Insider that Mitchell ""was an unmitigated disaster"" and ""didn't even attempt to poke holes in the many inconsistencies in Ford's story.""

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/13/liberal-slate-defends-facebooks-demotion-of-negative-kavanaugh-article-after-controversy-erupts","
        Liberal Slate defends Facebook's demotion of negative Kavanaugh article after controversy erupts
    Left-leaning Slate Magazine — unwilling to remain inside a left-wing bubble where ideology matters more than what's true — has just sided with conservative outlet The Weekly Standard's fact-check, agreeing that a ThinkProgress headline about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is indeed ""false.""
Certainly Slate's article is a study in fairness that the political left needs to digest — but those who lean to the right are subject to the same biases and can glean just as much wisdom from writer William Saletan.
What's the background?ThinkProgress published an article Sunday arguing that Kavanaugh's responses at last week's confirmation hearings, along with a speech of his last year, imply he would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, Slate said.
But Slate also offered that ThinkProgress' headline ""goes further"" as it claims Kavanaugh “said he would kill Roe v. Wade,"" the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
The Weekly Standard's fact-check pulled out the stop sign here. “While ThinkProgress engages in an argument to suggest how Kavanaugh might vote in a Roe v. Wade redo, the article does not provide evidence that ‘Kavanaugh said he would kill Roe v. Wade.’”
Facebook, noting The Weekly Standard fact-check, declared the ThinkProgress piece ""false,"" which came with a warning label and social media demotion. And ThinkProgress was furious — not only at The Weekly Standard but also at Facebook.
“Facebook’s entire relationship with The Weekly Standard appears driven by reckless disregard for the truth,” Ian Millhiser, author of the ThinkProgress article, noted later.
What's more, Slate said, ThinkProgress wants The Weekly Standard removed from Facebook’s list of approved fact-checking organizations because of its bias.
More from Slate:
And all this, believe it or not, came on the heels of a previous ThinkProgress article criticizing Facebook for not fact-checking enough — against the right.
But for Slate author Saletan — in the case of the ThinkProgress headline on Kavanaugh — the ""bias is on the left.""
What else did the Slate article say?""On Facebook, headlines are far more visible and widely read than articles are,"" Saletan points out. ""The headline on the ThinkProgress article was false. Kavanaugh didn’t say he would kill Roe. And the Standard was right to point this out.""
Slate added that The Weekly Standard said it would withdraw the “false” rating if ThinkProgress changes its headline, but ThinkProgress as of Wednesday was still digging in its heels. Millhiser even trotted out an argument that the dictionary definitions of “the verb ‘say’ or ‘said’ can mean to ‘indicate,’ ‘show,’ or ‘communicate’ an idea,” Slate noted, adding that Millhiser said Kavanaugh “indicated, showed, or communicated his intention to overrule"" Roe v. Wade based on past and recent statements.
And Saletan went to the mat against Millhiser point by point on the latter with gusto.
The bigger pictureSaletan added that ""by attacking the fact check as biased on the grounds that a conservative magazine published it,"" ThinkProgress and other groups of its political ilk ""proved the opposite of what they intended. They’ve confirmed that the press is full of left-leaning journalists who sometimes can’t see or acknowledge congenial falsehoods, and they’ve demonstrated how these journalists unite, when challenged, in a tribal chorus to accuse conservatives of trying to 'censor' them. In sum, they’ve demonstrated why we need conservative journalists to help check facts.""
More from Slate:
Saletan concluded: ""If progressives insist that anyone who challenges them is 'non-reality-based' — and that The Weekly Standard’s name on a fact check 'tells you all you need to know about how messed up Facebook’s notion of ""fact-checking"" is' — they’ll seal themselves off in a bubble of mutual affirmation.""

        SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh denies allegations of high school misconduct levied by unnamed woman
    An unnamed woman has accused SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
The incident reportedly occurred when the two were in high school in the early 1980s, according to a Friday report by The New Yorker.
Where did this come from?The information was reportedly delivered in a letter initially to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and then to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July — shortly after President Donald Trump chose Kavanaugh as his nominee for Supreme Court Justice — but the information has only become public as a result of this new report.
Feinstein reportedly turned the letter over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Neither Eshoo nor Feinstein took any action concerning the letter nor revealed its contents until this week.
An FBI spokesperson issued a statement Thursday in response to the news.
""Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh's background file, as per the standard process,"" the statement said.
On Friday, Feinstein — who is ranking member on the Senate Judiciary committee — issued her own statement on the letter, explaining that the woman was adamant in remaining anonymous.
""That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision,"" Feinstein said.
 
What are the details of the allegations?The letter to Feinstein reportedly revealed that the woman had attended a party with Kavanaugh and others in a Maryland home. According to the report, Kavanaugh reportedly pushed the woman into a bedroom along with another male. The SCOTUS nominee then reportedly proceeded to lock the door, and put on loud music in order to cover up the complainant's cries for help.
The woman said that Kavanaugh and the male were drunk, and that Kavanaugh attempted to remove her clothing. The letter described moments when Kavanaugh was reportedly on top of the woman while the other male jumped onto Kavanaugh.
The woman said that felt that her life was in danger when, she alleged, Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth.
She was able to free herself and ultimately leave the party in order to go home.
All three parties were minors when the alleged incident reportedly occurred.
The letter does not indicate whether the woman ever reported the alleged incident to law enforcement, but said that she received medical treatment in connection with the alleged assault.
The New Yorker reported that the woman declined to be interviewed about the alleged incident.
What did Kavanaugh say?In a Friday statement, the Supreme Court nominee denied the woman's allegations.
""I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement.
Also, the third party who was reportedly involved in the alleged incident has no recollection of the incident ever occurring.
Anything else?In a statement, White House spokesperson Kerri Kupec said, ""Throughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senators — including with Sen. Feinstein — sat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential session. Not until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new 'information' about him.""
On Friday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a letter that was signed by 65 women who knew Kavanaugh while in high school.
A portion of the letter read, ""Through the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity. In particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect. That was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day.""

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/04/commentary-christine-blasey-fords-latest-stunt-sinks-any-credibility-she-had-left","
        Commentary: Christine Blasey Ford's latest stunt sinks any credibility she had left
    There were many people who walked away from watching Christine Blasey Ford's testimony thinking she was a Democratic operative working to delay the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. I was not one of those people. I believed her pain was real. I believed that she was sexually assaulted by someone in her younger years — I just did not believe that it was, in fact, Brett Kavanaugh, for various reasons. But the antics of Ford and her lawyers Wednesday at the 11th hour (sound familiar?) of the FBI investigation have me now convinced I was dead wrong.
In Ford's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, she stated:
But on Wednesday, Ford's attorneys declared they would not comply with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley's request to deliver to the FBI documents that would — according to them — only bolster the credibility of Ford's testimony. Her legal team told Grassley they would withhold Ford's therapist notes and audio recording of Ford's lie detector test unless and until the FBI agreed to interview Ford as part of its investigation.
Well, wait a minute. If her motivation in coming forward was purely to ""provide facts"" and ""tell the truth"" and the requested documents would help the FBI corroborate her testimony, why would she withhold the information?
She already gave her sworn testimony of the account — under penalty of perjury — in front of Senate members and all of America. To assert that her account to the FBI would be different from her sworn testimony would be asserting she committed perjury. If her testimony was true, the FBI didn't need to interview her, which her attorneys most certainly knew.
Still, I didn't want to believe that Ford, a well-respected member of academia, would knowingly destroy a man's life over false allegations, so my initial reaction was to blame her attorneys. Maybe they were keeping information from her in an attempt to use her as a political pawn. After all, Ford seemed genuinely confused when she was told during the hearing that members of the Senate committee offered to come to her, due to her supposed fear of flying. In the same way, maybe her attorneys didn't tell her they were attempting to strong-arm and delay the FBI investigation by withholding documents, I thought.
But that can't possibly be the case in 2018 America. Unless Ford has been locked up in solitary confinement with no access to any media and no contact with the outside world, there's no way she didn't know Senate members offered to come to her for testimony, and there's no way she didn't know Grassley asked for documents that would corroborate her story to be included in the FBI investigation. So, the only reasonable conclusion is that she was involved in the decision to withhold the documents from the FBI.
If she was, in fact, a survivor of sexual assault at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, and her true intention was to ""provide facts and truth,"" as she stated in her sworn testimony, she would have delivered to the FBI both the recording of her lie detector test, along with notes from her therapist that would have allegedly corroborated her story.
Either way, Ford's collusion in this latest political stunt is a disgrace to all sexual assault survivors who do have the courage to come forward and speak out.

        Trump just went off on Christine Blasey Ford - and liberals are completely outraged
    President Donald Trump caused public outrage again over his comments mocking the account from Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford Tuesday at a rally.
'These are really evil people!'The president was speaking in Mississippi when he appeared to mock the holes in the account from Ford, who accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault decades ago.
""What he's going through — 36 years ago, this happened,"" the president said.
""I had one beer, right, I had one beer,"" he said in the person of Ford.
""Well, you think it was — nope, it was one beer,"" he added. ""Oh good. How did you get home? I don't remember.""
""How did you get there? I don't remember,"" he repeated. ""Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I dunno. I dunno.""
""I dunno! I dunno!!"" he exclaimed to great applause from the audience.
""What neighborhood was it in? I dunno,"" he continued. ""Where's the house? I dunno?""
""Upstairs, downstairs, where was it?"" he added. ""I dunno, but I had one beer. That's the only thing I remember.
""And a man's life is in tatters, a man's life is shattered, his wife is shattered, his daughters, who are beautiful, incredible, young kids,"" Trump said. ""They destroy people, they want to destroy people. These are really evil people!""
Here's the video of Trump's controversial comments:
'Misogynist display of barbaric insensitivity'""We can always count on the president to go to the lowest common denominator,"" responded Rep. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) on CNN about the president's comments, ""mock people, call people names, attack them.""
Others on the left were similarly outraged.
""This pig. And he didn’t even allow the FBI to interview her,"" responded liberal podcaster Amy Siskind.
""Trump just mocked Dr. Ford, a victim of sexual assault,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). ""This shouldn’t surprise us — he’s mocked Gold Star parents, the disabled, and prisoners of war. But it should disgust us all the same.""
""This is the most misogynist display of barbaric insensitivity I’ve ever seen,"" responded actress Alyssa Milano. ""THIS IS WHY I DIDN’T REPORT. THIS RIGHT HERE. Women are watching. And we vote.""

        Jamie Lee Curtis likens her 'Halloween' character to Christine Blasey Ford, as both endured 'trauma
    Actress Jamie Lee Curtis — best-known for her role as teenager Laurie Strode who is stalked by a masked killer in the classic horror flick ""Halloween"" — is out promoting the ""direct sequel"" to the original 1978 movie, also called ""Halloween,"" which releases Oct. 19.
The new movie ignores the franchise's other sequels and portrays Strode as having waited 40 years so she can kill Michael Myers, Rolling Stone said.
<U+FEFF>
Well, Curtis appeared on ""The View"" Monday to chat about the new ""Halloween"" — but a crucial portion of the conversation focused on trauma, which Curtis said her character endured and then suffered from over the course of her life.
She then linked Strode's trauma to the Christine Blasey Ford-Brett Kavanaugh controversy.
Ford recently accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting over 35 years ago when she was 15 and he was 17, throwing his already controversial Supreme Court nomination into chaos. Following their testimonies to the Senate Judiciary Committee in regard to the allegations, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the high court on Saturday.
What did Curtis say?Curtis said ""it happened to Laurie Strode in the movies, and here we are having a conversation, a global conversation about trauma and what effect that kind of trauma has on a person. And you guys talked about it earlier, about someone having it affect them their whole life. Christine Ford said this affected her.""
She added: ""And the heroine of 'Halloween' is a woman who suffered a trauma when she was 17 like Dr. Ford when she was 17. And it changed and shaped her life, and now she is taking back the power which is what all of these brave women have done.""

        Susan Collins cited Michael Avenatti accuser in her speech, and he is not happy about it
    Michael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film worker Stormy Daniels, lashed out at Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) over her speech that indicated his actions helped persuade her to vote for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 
""This was a disgrace and a gut punch""
Avenatti expressed his anger and frustration from his social media account after Collin's controversial speech. 
""[Senator Collins] should be ashamed of herself for attacking my client and Dr. Ford,"" he tweeted. 

""How did she make a credibility determination as to my client? How is she qualified to do that without ANY investigation? She did ZERO to determine whether my client and her witnesses were credible,"" he added. 
Outlandish allegation without credible evidence"" 
Collins excoriated efforts to bully her into voting against Kavanaugh in her speech on the Senate floor Friday. But she also noted the efforts by Avenatti in bringing forth an accuser claiming that Kavanaugh aided numerous gang rapes, including one perpetrated on her. 
“This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others,"" Collins said in the speech. 
""That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness,” she added. 
""[Senator Collins] does not have the judgment to be a US Senator,"" Avenatti continued in a second tweet. 

""She never met my client, never had her interviewed,"" he argued, ""never met the 6 witnesses supporting her declaration or had them interviewed, and never cross examined my client. And yet she made a credibility determination. How?""
Avenatti's client, Julie Swetnick, appeared on MSNBC to tell her story, but even the anchor on the progressive news channel had to admit that she changed her story from the statement she gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The conflicting accounts severely undercut the credibility of Swetnick's claims. 
""She attacked my client""
""[Senator Collins] did not attack me, she attacked my client,"" Avenatti concluded.  ""A woman who came forward as a sexual assault victim. And she attacked Julie and 'shamed her' without any facts and no investigation."" 

""This was a disgrace and a gut punch aimed at survivors everywhere,"" he concluded. 
Here's part of Collins's speech in the Senate:

Collins' announcement means Kavanaugh is more than likely going to be confirmed by the Senate in a vote scheduled for Saturday.

        Orrin Hatch shuts down screaming pro-abortion protesters, liberal outrage ensues
    Outrage ensued after pro-abortion protesters screamed at Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and his dismissive comment Thursday over the impending confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
'How dare you talk to women that way!'Protesters attempted to harass and intimidate the 84-year-old senator from Utah, but he waved his hand dismissively and then told them to ""grow up"" after they began screaming at him.
""Why aren't you brave enough to talk to us and exchange with us?!"" demanded one protester.
In the video, Hatch waved them off.
""Don't you wave your hand at me!"" responded the protester. ""I wave my hand at you!""
""When you grow up I'll be ready,"" Hatch said to them as he got on the elevator.
""When we grow up!? How dare you talk to women that way!"" they began screaming. ""How dare you! How dare you!""
Hatch waved goodbye as the screaming continued and his guards threatened to arrest the women.
'No shame'The video was widely shared on social media from the pro-abortion Twitter account. Many on the left were outraged that Hatch would act so dismissively toward women protesters who were yelling profanities at him.

""Have been talking non-stop about how women’s anger is treated as both laughable and infantile,"" responded New York Magazine writer Rebecca Traister. ""Thanks Orrin Hatch, for continuing to be a walking f***ing advertisement for my book.""
""More than half of his constituents are women,"" said MSNBC contributor Joyce Alene. ""Many of them have experienced sexual violence or harassment, but apparently he can’t Senator Hatch can’t bother to listen to, let alone represent them.""
Here's how CNN responded to Hatch shutting down protesters:
Protests erupted on Thursday after the FBI allowed senators to review its report on the investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh. Many protesters noted women's issues and abortion as their motivation for protesting against the conservative judge.

        President Trump says people who made 'false' accusations about Kavanaugh should be held liable
    President Donald Trump believes that people who made “false” statements about Brett Kavanaugh should be held liable. He made the comment just hours after Kavanaugh was sworn-in as a Supreme Court justice on Saturday.
Earlier Saturday, the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh.
Trump told Fox News that it was difficult to watch the sexual assault allegations materialize against Kavanaugh.
The president told host Jeanine Pirro he believes the allegations contained “not a bit of truth.”
""I think that they should be held liable,"" Trump said on the program. ""You can't go around and whether it's making up stories or making false statements about such an important position, you can't do that. You can destroy somebody's life.""
Trump was asked about allegations raised by Julie Sweatnick, who was represented by attorney Michael Avenatti. He also represents Stormy Daniels.
Trump said that allegations raised against him by Avenatti and Daniels are false.
Swetnick alleged that Kavanaugh and his classmate Mark Judge in their younger days used to get young women drunk so they could be gang-raped by multiple boys.
Kavanaugh was forced to contend with accusations that could have dismantled his confirmation to the nation’s highest court, Trump told Pirro.
""It all came together in the end and people realized it was false accusations and false statements,"" Trump said.
Avenatti told USA Today it was incredible that Trump and others dismissed his client’s claims without investigating them. Swetnick was not interviewed by the FBI during the bureau's ""supplemental"" Kavanaugh investigation.
""Donald Trump is the most dishonest individual to ever hold the office of President of the United States,"" Avenatti said. ""He is the last person in the nation that should be accusing other people of engaging in falsehoods.""
""This is why women don't report sexual assaults,"" he added.
What about his comments about Blasey Ford?On Saturday, Trump thanked Senate Republicans for helping to get Kavanaugh confirmed. Trump also said he believes a speech he made earlier in the week was effective against Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford.
“I think that the Mississippi speech had a great impact, yes - I think it was a very important thing,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to a political rally in Topeka, Kansas.
During the speech, Trump mocked Blasey Ford and said her account lacked details. Some lawmakers, including Republicans, criticized Trump for his behavior.
“...I thought I had to even the playing field,"" Trump said. ""It was very unfair to the judge, and now I can very nicely say Justice Kavanaugh. It was a very unfair situation. So I evened the playing field. Once I did that, it started to sail through.”

        IN-Sen: Republican candidate Mike Braun blasts Sen. Joe Donnelly for Kavanaugh vote at first debate
    Newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was at the center of Monday night's Indiana Senate race debate between Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun and incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.
Donnelly voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump's first Supreme Court pick, voted against confirming Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote Saturday.
What happened at the debate?Braun, a businessman and former Indiana state representative, tore into Donnelly for voting against Kavanaugh during the debate in Westville, Indiana.
Donnelly defended himself from Braun's attacks by explaining why he felt voting for Kavanaugh would be wrong.
""I voted against Judge Kavanaugh because of concerns about his impartiality and concerns about his judicial temperament,"" Donnelly said.
Donnelly also suggested that Braun would do anything to stay in Trump's good graces.
""[Braun] was for Judge Kavanaugh on the first day,"" Donnelly said. ""If President Trump put up Bugs Bunny, [Braun] would have said he should go on the court.
""My job,"" he added, ""is to protect the court and to put people on who are qualified.""
In response, Braun noted that Donnelly — and other Democrats — would stop at nothing to advance the liberal political agenda.
""Democrats, including Joe Donnelly, will do or say anything when it comes to their political interests,"" Braun said. ""It is a blood sport.""
Anything else?A recent Fox News Poll showed Donnelly with a 2-point lead over Braun (43 percent to 41 percent) in their U.S. Senate race.
The topic of Kavanaugh was also featured in the poll, which noted that should Donnelly vote against Kavanaugh, 30 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for Donnelly. Thirty-two percent of voters said they would be less likely to vote for Donnelly in such a case, and 34 percent of voters said Donnelly’s vote on Kavanaugh would make no difference.
A previous Ipsos Public Affairs poll showed Donnelly and Braun locked in a dead heat.
Trump officially endorsed Braun in September during a campaign rally in Evansville, Indiana.
The Senate election in Indiana is one of 10 “most likely to flip in 2018,” CNN reported in January. The Cook Political Report calls the race a toss-up, as does Real Clear Politics.
Donnelly and Braun will face off in a second debate on Oct. 30 at the Toby Theater at Newfields in Indianapolis.
The election is set for Nov. 6.

        Here's what Cory Booker did immediately after voting against Brett Kavanaugh's SCOTUS confirmation
    Get ready to hear more from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) over the next two years.
Immediately after voting against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, Booker headed to Iowa where he used Kavanaugh's confirmation to stoke presidential speculation.
What are the details?Speaking to 1,400 Democratic activists at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual fall gala, Booker revealed his presidential chops, offering progressives a message of hope in light of President Donald Trump's record of accomplishments.
""It is not a time to give up, it’s a time to get up, to rise up, to speak up. It’s time for you not to wait for hope, but to be the hope,"" Booker said, according to the New York Times.
""Hope is the act of conviction that despair can never have the last word. We’re not defined in this state by Republicans in power; we’re defined by how we respond to them. We’re not defined by a president who mocks a hero, Dr. [Christine] Blasey Ford. We’re not defined by a president who doesn’t believe women,"" he added, the Washington Post reported.
During his 45 minute speech, Booker panned Trump while addressing American ideals and touching on iconic American leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. 
However, Booker did not specifically address the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. Instead, he framed ""the defeat in the context of previous liberal setbacks and struggles,"" the Post reported.
In all, Booker drew four standing ovations.
Is Booker running for president?Booker has not yet announced his 2020 intentions. However, all indications point to him making a run at the White House beginning next year. When media asked if Saturday's event was meant to stoke presidential speculation, Booker deflected.
""I do need to get in shape. So I will probably go jogging here in Iowa in the morning,"" he said. ""In all seriousness, we’re here to focus on the elections that are coming up in 31 days.""
Booker also responded directly to Trump, saying: ""I have nothing personal against the president.""
The trip was Booker's first to The Hawkeye State since campaigning for Hillary Clinton there during the 2016 presidential election.

        BREAKING: Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp says she will vote against Kavanaugh
    Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) has announced that she will vote ""no"" on the confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Here's what you need to knowHeitkamp, along with Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) were considered possible swing votes on Kavanaugh's nomination. Manchin, Collins, and Murkowski have yet to indicate how they will be voting.
Heitkamp told WDAY-TV, ""The process has been bad, but at the end of the day you have to make a decision. And I've made that decision.""
Asked what that decision was, Heitkamp clarified, ""I will be voting 'no' on Judge Kavanaugh.""
In an official statement released after the interview aired, Heitkamp said, in part:
She concluded by saying:

Republicans feel confident that they have 49 votes, so only one of the remaining three undecided senators would have to vote for Kavanaugh in order for Vice President Mike Pence to be able to use his tiebreaker vote as president of the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh.
Heitkamp has been in a close race with Republican challenger and current member of Congress Rep. Kevin Cramer. A new poll showed Cramer with a 10-point lead over Heitkamp. 60 percent of respondents to the same poll said that they supported Kavanaugh's nomination, while only 27 percent were against it.
This a developing story and will be updated as events warrant.

        Trump holds presser on NAFTA replacement, praises Kavanaugh, and defends tariffs
    During a sometimes wild and contentious news conference on Monday, President Donald Trump praised his new USMCA trade deal, tariffs, and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
What about the trade deal?The purpose of this news conference was to highlight the rollout of the USMCA, the replacement deal for NAFTA that the U.S. and Canada agreed to on Sunday.
Trump said that he was confident that the USMCA would pass Congress, although he hedged a bit by adding that Democratic members of Congress would purposely vote against something if they thought it would benefit Republicans.
What did the president say about Kavanaugh?After answering questions about the USMCA, Trump agreed to repeated requests by reporters to answer questions regarding Kavanaugh.
""You want to get off trade. You people are falling asleep with trade. To me it's the most exciting thing you can talk about,"" he said.
Trump criticized the controversy surrounding Kavanaugh, saying that what Kavanaugh has ""gone through the last three weeks is incredible.""
Trump insisted that he would not hold back the FBI, and that the agency would do whatever the Senate thought fit.
""I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer,"" he said.
He also praised Kavanaugh for admitting his struggles with alcohol, and remarked on his own personal commitment to not drink.
""I'm not a drinker,"" Trump said. ""I can honestly say, I've never had a beer in my life. That's one of my only good traits....Can you imagine if I had, what a mess I'd be? I'd be the world's worst.""
Referencing how Kavanaugh was criticized for his actions in high school, Trump said that some of the senators themselves were ""not angels."" When he was asked about that later in the news conference, Trump refused to clarify.
""I think I'll save it for a book like everybody else and I'll write it. OK? I'm not giving it to you,"" he said.

He took time to praise his tariffsTrump also took time to defend his administration's tariffs, and to criticize ""babies out there,"" including members of Congress, who had criticized the tariffs. He also singled out those who bashed the tariffs because they weren't ""free trade.""
He argued that ""because of the power of tariffs, and the power that we have with tariffs, we, in many cases, won't even have to use them. That's how powerful they are, and how good they are.""
Trump also seemed to blame the Great Depression on the end of U.S. tariffs and the recovery on its reimplementation.
""Everybody talked about the tariffs 'oh, the tariffs.' you know, tariffs ended in 1913. And they then went to a different system in 1918, totally unrelated. And then in 1928, you had the Great Depression. For a lot of different reasons, not necessarily our country's fault, but a little bit our country's fault. And then, in the 1930s, they said 'we better start charging some tariffs. We need money to come into our country again, OK?""
The Great Depression began in October of 1929, after a number of factors caused the stock market to crash. The Hoover administration's Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, referenced by Trump, caused other nations around the world to enact a flurry of tariffs that drove American exports from $5.5 billion to $1.7 billion over a three-year period. In 1934, FDR would reduce the levels of these tariffs. The Depression would continue until 1939.
Trump said that he add an additional $267 billion in tariffs, against China ""and China wants to talk, very badly. and I said, very frankly it's too early to talk. Can't talk now. Because they're not ready. Because they've been ripping us for so many years.""
""I'm using them to negotiate,"" he added. ""We have a lot of catching up to do with China. You know, when they drain us for $500 billion a year, which is probably the real number, and that's not including the theft of intellectual property and other things. And a lot of people say 'that's hard to value,' but a lot of people say that could be around $300 billion a year. That's a tremendous — you just can't let that happen.""
It's unclear where Trump got the $500 billion number from. Earlier in the news conference, he had referenced the $375 billion trade deficit that the U.S. has with China last year.

        Does anyone think the left will be satisfied with this FBI investigation?
    During Judge Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, Democrats repeatedly badgered him about the lack of an FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford's version of the story.
But barring time travel, it's hard to understand how they think the FBI would be able to discover anything conclusive about 36-year-old generalized allegations. And let's be honest, if these allegations against Kavanaugh have any merit, and the FBI never found a hint of them through multiple previous background checks, then the FBI is dangerously incompetent.
Democrats are executing their game plan to perfection. They created such a media ruckus with the last-minute accusation by Ford, then added fuel to the firestorm with even more absurd and more last-minute accusations from Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, that anyone who questions the accusations is automatically branded a woman-hater. It doesn't matter that, so far, there is no evidence to back up any of the women's claims. Senate Democrats planted seeds of doubt and that was more than enough.
RELATED: RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION: Lindsey Graham speaks for a lot of AmericaOnce Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona took the Democrats' bait on Friday, insisting on a further FBI investigation before a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh, the die was cast. There will be another FBI investigation and that means plenty more opportunities for Democrats to fan the media flames, continue crying foul, and figure out ways to delay the Kavanaugh confirmation indefinitely.
Privately, Democrats must be staring at each other in disbelief, their minds blown by how perfectly this has gone to plan.
On Saturday, the White House confirmed there will be an additional FBI investigation that will supposedly last this week only. Investigators will interview Kavanaugh's high school friend, Mark Judge, whom Democrats are convinced is the missing link in their quest to prove Kavanaugh is a scumbag. The FBI will also interview Deborah Ramirez, the accuser from Kavanaugh's college days at Yale. The other two witnesses the FBI plans to interview are Leland Keyser and P.J. Smyth, who Ford says were both at the party where the alleged attack took place. So, everything will for sure be totally cleared up by Friday.
In a shocking development, Democrats are already complaining about the limited scope and time restraint of this investigation.
The great part for America is that we now get to enjoy this parody of a soap opera for at least one more week.

        Democrat mocks Republican Senator over threats made against her, and gets swift blowback
    Representative Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) was forced to delete a very dismissive and mocking tweet aimed at a female Republican Senator over threats made against her office. 
""Boo hoo hoo""
Republican Senator Collins of Maine is considered one of the ""swing votes"" for the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and she lamented that she had become the target of threats by those trying to sway her vote. 
Swalwell mocked her statement in a tweet that was excoriated by both sides for its insensitivity. 
""Boo hoo hoo,"" he mocked. ""You're a senator who police will protect. A sexual assault victim can't sleep in her home tonight because of threats."" 
""Where are you sleeping?"" he continued his taunt. ""She's on her own while you and your @SenateGOP colleagues try to rush her through a hearing.""

""To dismiss this... is really sick!""
Swalwell was berated for his insensitive tweet on CNN by Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter, who cited recent acts of violence against Republican members of Congress including Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.). 
""I was really disappointed to see Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell say 'boo hoo' to that. Boo hoo? Excuse me, there was a Congressional baseball shooting not that long ago, Rand Paul's neighbor broke his ribs. Violence is happening""  
""To dismiss this, in this environment, is really sick!"" she concluded. 
""I said something stupid"" 
The Democratic rep. eventually deleted the tweet and apologized. 
""Sexual assault victims deserve respect,"" he said in a second tweet hours later after the backlash. ""And senators shouldn’t be threatened by the public."" 

""I said something stupid and minimized ugly behavior,"" he added. ""That tweet is deleted and I’m sorry for that.""
Collins has not yet decided whether she will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

        Journalists made a damaging Kavanaugh story go viral - but it was too good to be true
    Mainstream media reporters and commentators appeared to be much too zealous in spreading a false story on social media Friday that was very damaging to Brett Kavanaugh, the president's nominee to the Supreme Court. 
""I should not have RTed this.""
The story was contained in just one tweet, and it had no link, just a claim that the content came from the Wall Street Journal. 
Despite the dubious sourcing, various reporters retweeted it over and over for hours, apparently in hope that the damaging story was true. 
The tweet came from an account named ""Alan Covington,"" and it said that Republicans pulled a prosecutor who was questioning Brett Kavanaugh during his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee because she had determined he had lied. 
""Mitchell advised Republicans that to continue questioning Kavanaugh she was required by her oath in Arizona to inform Kavanaugh of his rights after he lied to her,"" the tweet read. 
""That WSJ story doesn't appear to exist""
But the story was completely false, and they soon began to delete their tweets and undo their retweets. 
Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe apologized for rushing to post the tweet.

""I erred in believing that the WSJ 'story' was authentic and deleted my retweet as soon as I learned the tweet below was fake but didn’t have time to tweet a correction until now,"" Tribe tweeted. ""Sorry for the delay.""
Joshua Holland, a contributor to The Nation, was so incensed by the fake story, he added, ""They covered up a felony in the middle of the f**king hearing."" After he discovered it was fake, he tweeted, ""Couldn't find the story at WSJ so I deleted this tweet.""
Aaron Blake of the Washington Post admitted retweeting it and warned others not to keep posting it. 

Matt Yglesias of Vox News posted a screenshot of his propagation of the story - he got 53 retweets at the time of the screenshot. 

Others, like Justin Sink of Bloomberg, mocked everyone for reposting the false story, and also for ""freaking out"" over it. 

The owner of the account later claimed that he was hacked when the false message went out. 
President Donald Trump has often criticized the news media for what he sees as ""fake news"" and anti-Republican bias.

        Senators vow 'full scale' investigation to determine who leaked Kavanaugh accuser's letter
    Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton (R) charged Sunday that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, will face an investigation over her office's handling of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who initially accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Weeks after President Donald Trump announced Kavanaugh's nomination, Ford wrote Feinstein an anonymous letter outlining her allegations. She demanded she remain anonymous. But sometime after the media learned of the allegations, Ford's letter was leaked to the press. The only people who reportedly had access to the letter were Feinstein's office, the office of Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), and Ford's attorneys.
How the letter leaked has been a huge source of contention, as it could prove a level of coordination to undermine Kavanaugh's confirmation.
What did Cotton say?Speaking on CBS' ""Face The Nation,"" Cotton also revealed that Ford's attorneys will face a Washington, D.C., bar investigation for allegedly withholding from their client the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee offered to take her testimony in a confidential manner by flying staffers to interview her in California.
""They have betrayed her. She has been victimized by Democrats...on a search-and-destroy mission for Brett Kavanaugh,"" Cotton said, according to Politico.
""Any impact that this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault, which I encourage them all to do immediately after it happens, is caused by the Democrats, is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respecting her requests for confidentiality,"" he explained.
Anything else?Speaking on ABC News' ""This Week,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) vowed a ""wholesale, full scale investigation"" to determine who leaked Ford's letter.
""We're going to do a wholesale, full scale investigation of what I think was a despicable process to deter it from happening again,"" Graham said, according to the Washington Examiner.
""The FBI will do a supplemental background investigation, then I'm going to call for an investigation of what happened in this committee. Who betrayed Dr. Ford's trust? Who in Feinstein's office recommended Katz as a lawyer? Why did Ms. Ford not know that the committee was willing to go to California?"" he added.
Feinstein has denied that anyone in her office leaked the letter. During Thursday's emotional hearing, Graham told Feinstein he believed her denials. He reiterated that acceptance on Sunday.
""All I can tell you is it came from somebody with a political motive,"" Graham said. ""No friend would do this to Dr. Ford.""

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/27/democratic-senator-launched-fundraiser-off-kavanaugh-allegations-now-shes-apologizing","
        Democratic senator launched fundraiser off Kavanaugh allegations. Now she’s apologizing.
    The re-election campaign for Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) apologized Thursday for a fundraising email that mentioned the assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
What did it say?The email suggested Hirono could not give adequate attention to fundraising because she was consumed by the Kavanugh investigation.
The email was sent shortly after professor Christine Blasey Ford began testifying for the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to published reports. The hearing played out on national TV Thursday.
""I am spending every minute of my day fighting the Republicans who are desperate to rush Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and deny a fair investigation into the credible sexual misconduct allegations against him,"" Hirono wrote. ""This has to be my focus.""
""What that means is I have limited time to campaign for our re-election or to fundraise — making us particularly vulnerable to right-wing attacks,"" she added.
The message contained a donation button for ""$3 or more"" and had two ""contribute"" buttons, CNN reported.
Hirono is one of the most outspoken Democrats on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, who has denied the allegations.
About an hour after the email was sent, Hirono's campaign apologized.
“A fundraising message was sent this morning in error,"" read an email signed by ""Team Hirono."" ""We apologize sincerely for the error. All contributions that were made on this page will be donated to organizations helping survivors of sexual assault.""
Has anyone else done this?Hirono is not the only Democrat who has tried to capitalize on the Kavanaugh hearing, CNN reported.
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) filed a lawsuit Wednesday to stop the Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
Merkley also sent an email about the lawsuit that asked supporters to donate between $5 and $50.
Merkley said the email was simply him speaking with his base.
""Well, very simple thing is all of us keep our constituency informed about what we're doing. We ask for support if people agree with it,"" he told CNN.
He also reportedly said that if people ""want to support me, that's separate from the issue here before us of a violation of separation of powers.”

        White House press secretary Sarah Sanders praises Lindsey Graham for his defense of Kavanaugh
    White House press secretary Sarah Sanders praised Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C) for his passionate defense of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
What did she say?Her comments came after Graham blasted Democrats during Thursday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which heard testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the nominee of sexual assault.
"".@LindseyGrahamSC has more decency and courage than every Democrat member of the committee combined. God bless him,"" Sanders wrote on Twitter.

During the hearing, Graham said Democrats have mismanaged sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. He also described Kavanaugh’s confirmation process as ""the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.""
""God, I hate to say it, because these have been my friends,"" Graham said, referring to his Democratic colleagues, ""but let me tell you, when it comes to this, you're looking for a fair process? You came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend.""
Graham also addressed Kavanaugh.
""I hope you're on the Supreme Court,"" Graham told Kavanaugh. That's exactly where you should be. I hope the American people are able to see through this charade, and I wish you well, and I intend to vote for you, and I hope everybody who's fair-minded will.""
 
Anything else?Trump tweeted on Thursday, “Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him. His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting. Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist. The Senate must vote!”

        GOP Sens. Graham, Hatch, and Lee were doxxed during the Kavanaugh hearing on Thursday
    Three Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee had their personal phone numbers and home addresses briefly posted on Wikipedia.
What happened?During Thursday's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the home addresses and personal phone numbers for Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Orrin Hatch (Utah), and Mike Lee (Utah) were briefly published on Wikipedia.
While the Washington Post was able to confirm most of the addresses and phone numbers as being legitimate, at least one listed as Graham's home phone number was actually the number for an LGBT advocacy group.
On Twitter, White House spokesman Raj Shah called this “outrageous” and urged those involved to “[p]lease stop.”
This is outrageous. Please stop https://t.co/kkByAg49qs— Raj Shah (@RajShah45) September 27, 2018“It’s shocking that someone would post Senator Hatch and other Judiciary Committee Republicans’ home addresses online, putting their families at risk,” Matt Whitlock, a spokesman for Hatch told TheBlaze. “That it happened as they were asking questions in a Supreme Court confirmation hearing is just another indication of how broken this process has become.”
The Wikipedia pages for all three senators show that they were edited yesterday, and then those edits were quickly undone by Wikipedia administrators. The edits were also locked so that people with editor status cannot go back and view the original edits.
The edits to Hatch's page were up for 25 minutes. the ones to Lee's page were up for two minutes. Graham's page seems to have been corrected almost immediately. All these changes were made between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.
According to the Post, the Twitter bot @congressedits, which automatically tweets any Wikipedia article edited from any congressional IP addresses, tweeted out all three of these pages. The account said that the pages were “edited anonymously from US House of Representatives.”
This would mean that whoever doxxed the senators did so using the internet at the U.S. Capitol. It does not mean that the pages were edited by a member of Congress, just by a person present at that location. These tweets have since been deleted.

        Democrats consider a stunning new strategy against Kavanaugh - even if he's confirmed
    Congressional Democrats issued a threat about what they would do if Republicans are able to get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, and the midterms push the House of Representatives into the Democrat's column.
Here's what they said
Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) said that Democrats would investigate accusations of perjury against Brett Kavanaugh even if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court.
""If they ramrod this nomination through, and we win the majority, we can still investigate this on the House side, and certainly the question as to whether a Supreme Court justice committed perjury is something you could look at,” Swalwell threatened.
""Hopefully it doesn’t come to that,"" he added, ""hopefully they do this right.""
""Because,"" he concluded, ""it’s going to get investigated either way and it would be better not to have to investigate a sitting judge.”
Swalwell had made headlines Thursday when he mocked Senator Susan Collins (R-Me.) over threats that were being made against her because of the Kavanaugh decision. He eventually deleted the offending tweet and apologized.
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) agreed with the stunning strategy.
“You can't ignore a crime victim's claim that something happened,"" Whitehouse said on CNN, ""refuse to investigate, throw her up into the stand without the least bit of support for her, without the least bit of effort to corroborate what she says and then walk away from that.""
Here's the latest on the Kavanaugh debate:

Democrats hope the 2018 midterms will follow the historical trend of elections transferring seats to the out-of-power party, while Republicans have downplayed polling signs of a ""blue wave"" against the policies of President Donald Trump.

        Grassley says Kavanaugh accuser has until Monday to testify; will be no further FBI investigation
    Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said that the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh would proceed whether or not Kavanaugh's accuser — Dr. Christine Blasey Ford — agreed to testify on Monday.
He also rejected demands made by Kavanaugh's accuser to wait until after a further FBI investigation, stating that the FBI had already updated Kavanaugh's background check and would not be performing any further work to assess the credibility of Ford's accusations.
What are the details?California professor Christine Blasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a party when they were both in high school. On Monday, Grassley asked Ford to appear before the committee next week in order to testify regarding these allegations.
Ford's lawyers responded on Tuesday, saying that she would not testify publicly until a “full investigation by law enforcement officials” had been completed.
On Wednesday, Grassley said in an official letter to Ford's lawyers that the Kavanaugh hearings would begin again on Sept. 25 with or without Ford's testimony.
Grassley added that his staff would be willing to speak to Ford “at a time and place convenient to her.” A spokesman for the judiciary committee told The Hill that Grassley would be willing to send staff members to California to hear from Ford in person.
We’re going to continue to try to hear from Dr. Ford in any format she's comfortable w open session/closed session/private staff interviews/public staff interviews bc her information is very important. We’ve provided an opportunity for her to put her story fwd on Monday 2/4— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 19, 2018While Ford's lawyers and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) have demanded that the hearing be postponed until an FBI investigation can be completed, the Department of Justice has stated that the FBI does not have jurisdiction in this matter.
Even critics of Kavanaugh seemed to agree that the hearings needed to move forward. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who has been outspoken in her skepticism of Kavanaugh, tweeted on Wednesday that she hoped Ford would accept Grassley's invitation to testify.
I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.— Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 19, 2018While Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) had originally said that the hearing needed to be postponed until Ford's testimony could be heard, on Tuesday he said that if Ford refused to testify on Monday, the Senate should move forward with their vote.
How likely is it that Kavanaugh will be confirmed?Only 51 votes are needed to confirm a Supreme Court nominee, and Republicans currently hold exactly that many seats in the Senate. Even if Sen. Collins changes her vote to a ""no,"" Vice President Mike Pence could still cast the deciding vote in his role as president of the Senate.
However, if a single additional Republican senator, such as Flake or Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), decide to vote against Kavanaugh, his confirmation would rely on someone from outside the Republican Party.
In U.S. history, only 12 of a total 163 Supreme Court nominees have been rejected by the U.S. Senate. The latest example of this was Robert Bork in 1987.

        President Trump: Former AG Eric Holder's 'kick them' comments were 'disgusting
    President Donald Trump blasted former Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday for his statement that Democrats should put civility aside and ""kick"" Republicans.
What did Trump say?“He better be careful what he’s wishing for, that I can tell you,” Trump said during an interview with Fox News. “He better be careful what he’s wishing for. That’s a disgusting statement for him to make.”
Trump said Holder making such a statement is “very dangerous.”
Holder, who served as attorney general in the Obama administration, made the statement Sunday during a local campaign event for Georgia Democratic candidates.
In the clip, Holder called for a confrontational tone and approach similar to the conduct seen during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation conflict and other debates. Holder said Republicans have used their power for all of the wrong things.
“It is time for us, as Democrats, to be as tough as they are, to be as dedicated as they are, to be as committed as they are, Holder said. Michelle always says – Michelle Obama...When they go low, we go high. No, no. When they go low, we kick them.”

The crowd clapped and hollered in approval at his statement.
“That’s what this new Democratic Party’s about,” he continued. “We’re proud as hell to be Democrats, we’re going to fight for the ideals of the Democratic Party. We’re proud of our history. We’re proud of the present and we’re proud of the future we can create for this country.”
Holder’s remarks came after Hillary Clinton told CNN during an interview, “You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for.""
Holder could be a 2020 presidential candidate and is expected to make a final decision on running early next year.
“I think the primaries would gobble him up,” Trump said of that prospect.
Trump has also been accused of contributing to a political tensions, especially for his blazing attacks on Twitter against his critics.
What else is causing this climate?Trump's interview with the news outlet followed a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he criticized Democrats for their failed efforts to keep Justice Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court.
The president called Democrats' actions a disgrace and added that he never considered giving up his support for Kavanaugh, who was narrowly confirmed following accusations of sexual assault.
Trump has openly criticized Kavanaugh’s key accuser Christine Blasey Ford. She accused Kavanaugh of unwanted sexual contact at a high school party more than 35 years ago. Kavanaugh has denied the incident.
In response to aggressive tactics by Democrats, Trump is campaigning almost daily in an effort to drum up support for Republican candidates.

        Ford’s own team kills liberal narrative: Alleged attack did not happen at July 1, 1982, party
    A member of Christine Blasey Ford's legal team killed a popular narrative pushed by liberals claiming to have pinned down a possible date for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's alleged sexual assault of Ford.
Anti-Kavanaugh senators and left-wing activists claimed, using Kavanaugh's own calendar, that the attack could have taken place at a July 1, 1982, party. However, Ford's team pointedly said this week that the assault did not occur on that date, Politico reported.
What are the details?According to one of the members of Ford's legal team — who spoke to Politico on the condition of anonymity — the FBI interviewed people named on Kavanaugh's personal calendar from 1982 and who were reportedly present for a July 1, 1982, gathering.
The team member said, however, that Ford did not believe July 1 was the night of the alleged assault, because she didn't recall that some of those people listed on Kavanaugh's calendar entry for July 1 were actually at the event where the purported attack took place.
“[Ford] would have told them that she never considered July 1 as a possible date, because of some of the people listed on his calendar who she knew well and would have remembered,” the team member told Politico.
The team member went on to say that the FBI wrongly focused on that date, despite the fact that anti-Kavanaugh Democrats made the July 1 calendar entry a focus of their opposition to and accusations against the nominee.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I) vehemently insisted that the alleged incident may well have occurred on that date. He went so far as to graphically highlight the names listed on the July 1, 1982, calendar entry to make his case during one of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the Kavanaugh nomination.

To date, Ford herself has not produced a date for the alleged attack, nor has she produced any concrete evidence that the assault itself actually occurred.
Who did the FBI talk to?According to the report, the FBI interviewed people who were reportedly present for a gathering on July 1, 1982. One such person at the July 1 gathering was a young man that Ford dated.
The team member said, according to Politico, that Ford would also have told the FBI that the evening of the alleged assault was simply a regular night and that there'd be no reason for those in attendance to remember it in particular.
“[Ford] would have also told the FBI that it was just a regular summer night for everyone else who was there,” the team member said. “There would have been no reason for them to remember it.”

        It's a bulls*** investigation:' Menendez, other Democrat senators complain about FBI's probe
    Democrats are, predictably, not happy with the FBI's supplemental investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which by all accounts turned up no new corroborating evidence to support Christine Blasey Ford's claim that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.
One of the most passionate criticisms of the investigation came from Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who called the investigation ""bulls***"" and said the FBI didn't interview everyone they should have.
""If that's an investigation, it's a bulls*** investigation,"" Menendez said in a Twitter video Thursday. ""The reality is, that is not a full and thorough investigation. Evidently the Republicans who gave the direction to the FBI on what could be investigated was extremely limited. I hear a lot about lack of corroboration. Well, you don't get corroboration if you don't talk to corroborating witnesses.""

Despite Menendez's claim, it appears the FBI didn't talk to any corroborating witnesses because there are none that they, Senate staff, or the media have been able to find. The FBI interviewed the people Ford claimed were at the party she was allegedly sexually assaulted at, including a reported three-hour interview with Mark Judge, who Ford said was in the room when it happened. No one backed up Ford's story.
Based on what is currently known from the still-confidential report, the FBI interviewed Judge, Patrick Smyth and Leland Keyser, who Ford said were at the party. The FBI also talked to Tim Gaudette, a friend and classmate of Kavanaugh's from high school who was listed on the judge's calendars.
Additionally, the FBI spoke with Chris Garrett, also known as ""Squi,"" who ""went out with"" Ford and was a friend of Kavanaugh's, and who was also possibly at the alleged party. Finally, the FBI spoke with Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while the two were at Yale. No one has publicly corroborated Ramirez's accusation.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, implied that the FBI report was missing key information, saying ""the most notable part of the report is what's not in it.""
""The FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh, nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford,"" Feinstein said. ""We have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but who were not interviewed.""
Feinstein speculated that the investigation was hindered intentionally by the White House, and rehashed claims that the White House prevented the Senate Judiciary Committee of withholding documents related to Kavanaugh.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he disagrees with Sen. Chuck Grassley's conclusion that there was no hint of misconduct by Kavanaugh.
""We had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the fact,"" Schumer said. Having received a thorough briefing on the documents, those fears have been realized.""

        Liberal entertainer Bette Midler issues apology after bizarrely calling women ‘N-word of the world’
    Actress and comedian Bette Midler is apologizing after calling women the ""n-word of the world"" in a Thursday tweet — even though she initially doubled down on the questionable remarks.
How on earth ... ?Midler invoked her liberal rage over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27 during which he vehemently denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had sexually assaulted her.
Ford also testified on the same day.
In her since-deleted tweet, Midler wrote, ""'Women, are the n-word of the world.' Raped, beaten, enslaved, married off, worked like dumb animals; denied education and inheritance; enduring the pain and danger of childbirth and life IN SILENCE for THOUSANDS of years They are the most disrespected creatures on earth.""
Midler was pointing to a song written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono with the same title.
In a second since-deleted tweet, Midler tried to explain away her remarks.
She wrote, ""I gather I have offended many by by last tweet. 'Women are the...etc.' is a quote from Yoko Ono from 1972, which I never forgot. It rang true then, and it rings true today, whether you like it or not. This is not about race, this is about the status of women; THEIR HISTORY.""
Let’s not pretend there wasn’t a serious doubling down before this apology.Before the apology this Tweet basically said I don’t give a %#%^ if you’re offended.<U+0001F447><U+0001F3FE> pic.twitter.com/YoOfJ37xow
— Bishop Talbert Swan (@TalbertSwan) October 5, 2018Naturally, her follow-up tweet didn't go over well, either.
Midler's remarks generated tons of backlash — including with her fellow liberals — so she issued an apology, placing the blame squarely on Kavanaugh and the FBI's ""too brief"" investigation.
""The too brief investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh infuriated me. Angrily I tweeted w/o thinking my choice of words would be enraging to black women who doubly suffer, both by being women and by being black. I am an ally and stand with you; always have. And I apologize,"" she wrote.

        Political sign showing GOP elephant looking up female's dress stirs controversy in Texas
    A political sign in a small Texas town caused a big flap this week.
It started when Marion Stanford of Hamilton, Texas, displayed a sign with an image of the GOP elephant logo sticking its trunk under the dress of a female figure. Next to the cartoon figure were the words “Help” and “Your vote matters.” In the background of her display were campaign signs supporting Democratic candidates Lupe Valdez, Beto O’Rourke, Julie Oliver and Miller’s challenger, Kim Olson.
What happened?What began as a controversial political statement escalated to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller blasting Stanford on Facebook. Police also reportedly arrived at Stanford's home to confiscate her sign, according to published reports.
Stanford defended the sign by saying she made it after watching testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh regarding sexual assault allegations against him.
Facebook users accused Stanford of using a likeness of Kavanaugh's daughter for the sign.
“That was not Judge Kavanaugh’s daughter,” Stanford told the Dallas Morning News. “The cartoon was made last year by Washington Post cartoonist Ann Telnaes, a Pulitzer Prize winner.”
Stanford told the news outlet she received angry phone calls and harassing messages on Facebook. On Tuesday night, police came to her home after they received complaints.
“Police told me to remove the sign or they would take it and would arrest me,” Stanford said. “So I let them take the sign.”
Miller wrote on Facebook: “This is in Hamilton, Texas and is supposed to be Judge Kavanaugh's young daughter. Notice my opponent's sign in the background. The Democrat sleaze knows NO bounds!”
Some Facebook users went as far as staying Stanford’s post amounted to pedophilia and she should be arrested.
The city manager of Hamilton, located about 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth, gave a different account of what happened.
“It’s political season, and a citizen here placed a yard sign that featured a political animal taking an inappropriate position with a young child,” Pete Kampfer, city manager of Hamilton, told the Dallas Morning News. “A police member visited the owner’s home, and the owner asked the officer to take the sign.”
What about free speech?Kampfer said the city strongly supports the Constitution and free speech.
Meanwhile, the sign is still at the police station.
Southern Methodist University law professor and First Amendment expert Dale Carpenter told the news outlet the sign is protected under the First Amendment.
“There is no basis I can see for removing the sign,” Carpenter said. “It’s not obscene, and no court would find it to be. You can say it’s offensive or distasteful, but that’s protected under the Constitution.”

        WSJ report details alleged effort by Christine Blasey Ford's team to influence witness testimony
    Text messages unearthed by FBI suggest sophisticated effort by Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford's team to coordinate messaging and possibly influence witness testimony.
Here's what you need to knowFord has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a party in 1982.
Leland Keyser was the high school friend of Ford who Ford testified was also at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her. Keyser had initially testified that she had no recollection of this party, but then later clarified that she was not trying to undermine Ford's testimony.
Ford speculated during her testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Keyser might not remember the party because, except for the alleged assault, it was largely unremarkable. According to Ford, Keyser was also downstairs at the time of the assault (which allegedly occurred in a second floor bedroom), so may not have been aware of it.
On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ford's friend Monica McLean, a retired FBI agent, had contacted Keyser and pressured her to clarify her statement. During their investigation into Kavanaugh, the FBI reportedly obtained text messages showing McClean reaching out to Keyser about this topic.
This is the same Monica McLean who an ex-boyfriend of Ford testified Ford had coached in case McLean needed to take a polygraph for her job at the FBI. In an interview with CNN, McLean strongly denied these allegations, but the CNN report itself was not without problems.

Right-leaning reporters on Twitter were quick to point out that McLean was also part of the team that sat with Ford during her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

A person close to Ford and Keyser told The Wall Street Journal that McLean and other mutual friends of the two women had reached out to Keyser and told her that her original statement could be used to discredit Ford. This person insisted that nobody had ""pressured"" Keyser, although it is also not clear if the source had been one of these friends.
McClean's lawyer, David Laufman, has put out a statement denying this report:
McClean previously worked as a spokeswoman for Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who had been fired by President Donald Trump in 2017. Bharara also used to work for Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
Keyser was interviewed by the FBI during their final weeklong investigation into Kavanaugh. It was interviews like hers that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said were the most telling, people who were friends with Ford and had been “sympathetic in wishing they could [corroborate her story], but they could not.”
On Thursday, the same day the Senate saw the FBI's final report, Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to Ford's lawyers demanding that they turn over records that included communication between Ford's representatives and Keyser ""in light of recently uncovered information. Grassley wrote:

        Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers claim the FBI has ignored them during its investigation
    Christine Blasey Ford's lawyers say they can't get a hold of anyone with the FBI to talk about the investigation into Ford's allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, according to a letter sent to the agency.
With only a few days left in the investigation, Ford's lawyers claim they are increasingly concerned that the FBI may not even want to interview Ford or Kavanaugh.
“This afternoon, we learned of media reports that the FBI does not intend to interview either Dr. Ford or Judge Kavanaugh,” the letter read. “We hope that this reporting is inaccurate.""
Ford's lawyers say they spoke with FBI general counsel Dana Boente on the phone Friday night, and haven't heard anything since that conversation. According to the letter, they've:
 	 	 	According to Ford’s lawyers, it would be “inconceivable” for the FBI to not conduct the investigation according to the requests they have made to the agency.
“It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford’s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,” they wrote.

NBC News reported Tuesday that the FBI was indeed not planning to interview Ford or Kavanaugh. Perhaps the agency decided that the hours of sworn testimony from Thursday's hearing was enough, and that in a limited time frame its resources were best allocated elsewhere.
The FBI is, however, speaking to the other people allegedly at the party where the assault is supposed to have occurred: Mark Judge, Leland Keyser and Patrick Smyth.
Michael Avenatti's client, Julie Swetnick, has not been interviewed, much to Avenatti's disappointment. Swetnick's extreme and inconsistent accusations have been widely discredited and dismissed by members of both parties.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/03/did-christine-blasey-ford-lie-to-the-senate-about-polygraphs-see-the-evidence-for-yourself","
        Did Christine Blasey Ford lie to the Senate about polygraphs? See the evidence for yourself.
    In a sworn statement released Tuesday, an ex-boyfriend of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a house party in 1982, directly contradicted part of Ford's sworn testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
What are the details?During the hearing, Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona sex crimes prosecutor who questioned Ford on behalf of Republican senators, asked Ford: ""Have you ever had discussions with anyone, besides your attorneys, on how to take a polygraph? And I don't just mean countermeasures, but I mean any sort of tips or anything like that?""
""Never,"" Ford responded, adding that she was fearful of the test itself.
""Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test?"" Mitchell followed up.
""Never,"" Ford answered.
But Ford's ex-boyfriend, whom she dated for six years, said in his statement that he witnessed Ford coach a friend, who was applying for a job with the FBI, on how to best prepare for a polygraph examination.

""I witnessed Dr. Ford help McLean [Ford’s friend and former roommate, according to the letter] prepare for a potential polygraph exam. Dr. Ford explained in detail what to expect, how polygraphs worked and helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam. Dr. Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology,"" the statement reveals.
The ex-boyfriend, who submitted his sworn statement under penalty of felony, also claimed Ford never told him of her alleged sexual assault, nor did she ever express a fear of flying or being confined in small places. She testified to the Judiciary Committee that she is claustrophobic, and therefore afraid of flying.
In response to the development, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote Ford's attorneys Tuesday demanding they turn over evidence they have so far refused to provide the committee, specifically notes from Ford's therapist and any evidence related to Ford's polygraph test, including results and video or audio recordings.

Why is this significant?If true, it potentially clears the path for legal repercussions. Not only is lying to Congress while under oath a crime, but so is obstructing a congressional investigation with false statements. Grassley confirmed this in a letter last week.
But it could also open the door for Ford's entire testimony to be called into question.
Indeed, one of the notable exchanges between Kavanaugh and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) during last week's hearing came when the Democratic lawmaker asked Kavanaugh to define the phrase ""in unibus [sic], falsus in omnibus.""
The legal phrase Blumenthal referred to is ""Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus."" It's English translation means ""false in one thing, false in everything."" Of course, Blumenthal's reason for having Kavanaugh define the phrase was to remind him that lawmakers will consider his complete testimony to be untrue if there is a single hint of deception.
The question is, are lawmakers willing to equally apply that standard to Ford?
Anything else?A new investigative report also calls into question major details of Ford's story. She testified to the Senate that her fears of tight spaces — due to her alleged sexual assault — were dredged up when she and her husband installed a second front door on their Palo Alto home.
Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked Ford: ""Is that the reason for the second door — front door — is claustrophobia?""
Ford answered: ""Correct.""
More from RealClearInvestigations:
But documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an addition, and has been used by renters and even a marriage counseling business.You can read the entire investigative report here.
What did McLean say?She denied the boyfriend's allegations.
""I have NEVER had Christine Blasey Ford, or anybody else, prepare me, or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at anytime,"" she said in a statement provided to ABC News.
Editor's note: This story has been updated with a statement from Christine Blasey Ford's friend, Monica McLean.

        Dr. Ford's own study on hypnosis and memories tarnishes her testimony
    ""You're getting veeery sleepy…""
Feeling hypnotized yet? If so, you may be able to retrieve some memories. Maybe even traumatic memories.
I don't mean to make light of traumatic experiences. But memories are different – they're very fickle, tricky things. We don't remember things nearly as accurately as we think we do.
RELATED: Let's stop pretending the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh is credibleSince digging up every word Brett Kavanaugh has ever uttered is now an urgent, national priority, some have decided to do the same with Christine Blasey Ford. It turns out Dr. Ford co-authored a study in 2008 that cites hypnosis as a way to ""assist in the retrieval of important memories.""
The study also used ""self-hypnosis"" in treating patients. I didn't even know self-hypnosis was possible.
Ford's study references a separate study on hypnosis that found that, ""Patients are highly suggestible and easily subject to memory contamination.""
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You mean memories can be contaminated? Even when using hypnosis? Because I thought Dr. Ford's testimony last Thursday was ""her truth."" It wasn't necessarily the truth, but it was her truth – which according to Senate Democrats carries more weight.
We don't know whether Ford used hypnotic therapy on herself, nor whether her therapists used it, because her lawyers refuse to provide the Senate with detailed notes from her therapists. However, the shifting details of her story as she tells it definitely indicates some memory contamination (to put it mildly).
Ford told the Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her in 1982 when she was 15. But she supposedly showed some of her therapy notes to The Washington Post and their exclusive story described the incident as ""a rape attempt in her late teens."" And in her initial text to The Post, Ford said the attack happened in the mid-80s, which would've meant Kavanaugh was in college.
So, which one is the real time frame? During her testimony, Ford seemed to be trying to distract from her timeline discrepancies by repeatedly saying it would help if we could find out when Mark Judge worked at Safeway. As if the whole case rested on that.
One thing is clear – with or without hypnosis, ""her truth"" is much easier to arrive at than the truth.

        Unhinged Stanford left': Female student arrested after allegedly shoving college GOP president
    Following left-wing harassment last week of conservative students at the University of Texas at Austin during their event supporting Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, it was more of the same at Stanford University on Tuesday, as a female student was arrested for battery after allegedly shoving the president of the College Republicans over Kavanaugh support.
According to campus police, John Rice-Cameron said fellow student Melinda Hernandez “shoved him in the chest with her hand during a verbal disagreement” at tabling event in support of Kavanaugh’s recent Supreme Court confirmation, the Stanford Daily reported.
A post on the Stanford College Republicans Facebook page said its members “experienced the violent and totalitarian behavior of the unhinged Stanford left.""
<U+FEFF>
Rice-Cameron added to the paper that Hernandez ""got in my face and proceeded to hit me in the chest area and push me back forcefully"" and that ""nobody should be assaulted on campus, under any circumstances.”
He also told the College Fix that Hernandez shoved him after he shot video of her trying to vandalize a sign: “She comes up and puts her hand on the sign as if she’s going to rip it up, so I take out my phone and record her, and she said, ‘Why the f*** are you recording me?’ In an attempt to defuse the situation, I put the phone away.”
What did the accused student have to say?Hernandez told the Daily she touched Rice-Cameron on the chest after he refused to stop recording her on video.
“This is clearly an exertion of power and privilege by [the College Republicans],” Hernandez wrote in a public Facebook post, the paper added. “Those who know my character, from a distance or up close, know my fight in social justice lies in peace.”
Hernandez was placed under a private person arrest at Rice-Cameron’s request and issued a citation for battery, campus police told the paper, adding that the District Attorney’s Office will review the case and determine if further action is needed.
What did the Stanford Democrats have to say?Stanford Democrats President Gabe Rosen told the Daily that his group is “deeply concerned” that police were called: “This just adds to our suspicion that [‘Change My Mind’ events, such as the one in White Plaza] are not conducive to civil debate.""
In another post, the College Republicans said ""leftists vandalized and destroyed our signs, threw paint and water at our members, and hurled insults and profanities for hours.""
What did witnesses say?An anonymous eyewitness told the Daily that Hernandez was “angry [and] upset” and characterized her demeanor toward Rice-Cameron as combative: “She kept getting in his face, louder and louder — she walked straight towards him and invaded his personal space and definitely put her hands on him,” the unnamed witness added to the paper.
A College Republican member who declined to be named told the Daily that while Hernandez pushed Rice-Cameron, it wasn't a “hard push,” noting that the group's president didn't hit the ground.
Here's another clip of a student stealing a sign from the College Republicans' table:

        Ocasio-Cortez has a stunning fix for the Supreme Court if Democrats win
    Progressive firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave a stunning answer when asked about the Supreme Court and the recent confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the highest court of the land.
'We pack the Supreme Court...'The socialist Democrat took questions after a screening of Michael Moore's anti-Trump documentary ""Fahrenheit 11/9,"" and cheerfully took up a query about the Supreme Court from a member of the audience.
“If in a few months from now the Supreme Court looks like, I'm pretty scared it's going to,"" the man said, ""a court that would overturn Roe [v. Wade] and make the President above the rule of law, what is to be done?”
“I think we take back the House,"" Ocasio-Cortez answered. ""We take back the Senate.""
""We take back the presidency,"" she continued, ""and we pack the Supreme Court of the United States of America.""
""Next!"" she joked. ""No, thank you, it's a very important question.""
The answer received a lot of applause from the audience, but was jeered by others who thought it was as improbable as it was extreme.
Ocasio-Cortez has also said that she would like to abolish the electoral college, calling it ""a shadow of slavery’s power on America today that undermines our nation as a democratic republic.""

Here's the video of Ocasio-Cortez on the Supreme Court:

        NV-Gov: Republican Adam Laxalt back in front of Democrat Steve Sisolak by 1 point in new poll
    Is it an Adam Laxalt surge?
After falling behind Nevada Democratic gubernatorial nominee Steve Sisolak by 2 points in a Suffolk University/Reno Gazette-Journal poll last month, Laxalt — the state's Republican nominee — is back on top by a point among likely voters, 46 percent to 45 percent, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll.
Laxalt's 1-point lead reflects a head-to-head contest with Sisolak; but when the choice is expanded to include Libertarian candidate Jared Lord and “none of these,” the poll shows Laxalt ahead by 4 points, 44 percent to 40 percent.
Prior to falling behind Sisolak by 2 points in September, a Suffolk University/Reno Gazette-Journal poll released July 31 showed Laxalt ahead of Sisolak by less than 1 percentage point — 41.6 percent to 41 percent.
The Laxalt campaign on Wednesday declined to comment to TheBlaze on the new poll results.
Other numbersThe poll also said a greater percentage of likely voters have a favorable impression of Laxalt (43 percent) compared to Sisolak (42 percent). Laxalt also is in better shape when it comes to likely voters with an unfavorable impression of him (37 percent) compared to Sisolak (43 percent).
The poll was conducted between Sept. 30 and Oct. 3 — amid the controversy surrounding then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford in an alleged incident that she said occurred when they were teenagers over 35 years ago. Kavanaugh — nominated by President Donald Trump — was confirmed to the high court Saturday.
But despite Laxalt's slight lead, it doesn't appear related to GOP outrage over how Kavanaugh was treated by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In fact, a greater percentage of likely voters said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who opposed Kavanaugh (41 percent) than for a candidate who supported Kavanaugh (38 percent).
Good news for DemocratsThe poll indicates Nevada Democrats are more enthusiastic about November's contests, with 89 percent of likely Democratic voters saying the midterms are “very important” compared to 82 percent of Republicans.
A greater percentage of likely voters disapprove of Trump's overall job performance than approve of it, 47 percent to 45 percent, the poll says.
In addition, 51 percent said their vote will reflect a desire for more Democrats to balance Trump as opposed to the 39 percent of those who said their vote will reflect a desire for more Republicans to help Trump move forward with his agenda.

        Supreme Court Justices Kagan, Sotomayor concerned about court being viewed as politically divided
    Associate Justices of the Supreme Court Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said they are concerned the court’s legitimacy could be undermined if it is viewed as politically divided.
What did they say?""We don't have an army, we don't have any money, the only way we get people to do what we say that they should do is because people respect us and respect our fairness,"" Kagan said in an NJ.com report.
""Part of the court's legitimacy depends on people not seeing the court in the way that people see the rest of the governing structures of this country now. In other words, people thinking of the court as not politically divided in the same way, as not an extension of politics, but instead somehow above the fray,"" she also said.
The two Princeton graduates made their comments Friday during a “She Roars” women’s conference Friday at their alma mater. They avoided saying anything about the contentious atmosphere surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.
Sotomayor said the ""politicization of the court” comes from politicians debating the interpretation of the Constitution.
""Politicians have now superimposed that style on the Court,"" she said. ""That has hurt the Court and may continue to.""
Kagan, the first female dean of Harvard Law School, said the relationships between the justices is supportive: “We always know everyone is acting in good faith. We have lunch all the time and talk about our families. We laugh at each other’s bad jokes. And we get to escape each other in the summers.”
Neither justice waded into the debate surrounding sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. But they addressed challenges they have faced as women.
""You can't be a professional woman, even today, whether it's in law, in medicine, in any field, without having a moment where someone is going to treat you differently because you're a woman,"" Sotomayor said.
Kagan said she remembers the pictures of the former deans, all of them male and white, that were displayed in her predecessor’s office when she arrived.
“The first thing I did was take that picture down,” she said.

        Prosecutor who questioned Christine Blasey Ford dismantles Ford's case in scathing detail
    Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor who questioned Christine Blasey Ford on behalf of Republican senators last week during an emotional hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a memo late Sunday detailing why no ""reasonable prosecutor"" would bring a case against Brett Kavanaugh given the ""evidence"" that exists against him.
""A 'he said, she said' case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that,"" Mitchell said, explaining the case's ""bottom line.""
Ironically, Mitchell's language mirrors the vernacular of former FBI Director James Comey, who similarly argued in July 2016 that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server.
The career Arizona prosecutor, who specializes in sex-related crimes, goes on to outline eight reasons why no ""reasonable prosecutor would bring this case,"" explaining the evidence fails to ""satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.""
1. Ford has not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happenedMitchell explained that initially Ford said the assault occurred in the ""mid-1980s,"" but later changed the date to the ""early 80s."" But when she met with the polygraph administrator, Ford crossed out the word ""early"" for unknown reasons.
Ford has also described the incident occurring in the ""summer of 1982"" and her ""late teens"" — despite claiming it happened when she was 15.
""While it is common for victims to be uncertain about dates, Dr. Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the time frame to a particular season and particular year,"" Mitchell said.
2. Ford has struggled to identify Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by nameMitchell explained Ford neither identified Kavanaugh by name during marriage counseling in 2012 or individual counseling in 2013. Ford's husband claims she identified Kavanaugh in 2012, but Mitchell noted that Kavanaugh's name was widely circulated as a potential Supreme Court pick should then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have won the presidency.
""In any event, it took Dr. Ford over thirty years to name her assailant,"" Mitchell wrote. ""Delayed disclosure of abuse is common so this is not dispositive.""
3. When speaking with her husband, Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specificAccording to Mitchell, Ford told her husband before they married that she had been the victim of a ""sexual assault,"" but told the Washington Post that she told her husband she was a victim of ""physical abuse.""
""She testified that, both times, she was referring to the same incident,"" Mitchell said.
4. Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question — details that could help corroborate her accountMitchell explained:
 	 	 	Perhaps the most significant hole in Ford's memory, Mitchell said, is the fact that Ford does not remember how she returned home from the party.
Factually speaking, the location of the party that Ford identified to the Washington Post is a 20-minute drive from her childhood home. And it was only during her testimony last week that she agreed for the first time that someone had driven her somewhere that night. Ford remembers locking herself in a bathroom after the alleged assault, but cannot identify who drove her home.
Significantly, no one has come forward to identify themselves as the driver.
""Given that this all took place before cellphones, arranging a ride home would not have been easy. Indeed, she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did, or that she called anyone else thereafter,"" Mitchell said.
5. Ford’s account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended — including her lifelong friendAs widely reported, Mitchell explained that each individual Ford identified as having been at the party has submitted sworn statements — under penalty of felony — that they do not remember the party and cannot recall or corroborate any detail that Ford alleges.
6. Ford has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assaultFord claimed in her letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that she heard Kavanaugh and Mark Judge talking downstairs while hiding in a bathroom after the assault. But she testified that she could not hear anyone, and only ""assumed"" people were talking.
Meanwhile, Ford's therapist's notes show that she said there were four boys in the bedroom when she was assaulted. However, she told the Washington Post it was only two, and blamed the error on her therapist. Also, in Ford's letter to Feinstein she said there were ""me and 4 others"" at the party. However, in her testimony, she said there were ""four boys"" at the party in addition to herself and Leland Keyser, her female friend.
Additionally, ""Dr. Ford listed Patrick 'PJ' Smyth as a 'bystander' in her statement to the polygrapher and in her July 6 text to the Washington Post, although she testified that it was inaccurate to call him a bystander. She did not list Leland Keyser even though they are good friends. Leland Keyser’s presence should have been more memorable than PJ Smyth’s,"" Mitchell said.
7. Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations, and her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about her memoryMitchell explained that Ford is unable to accurately remember her interactions with the Washington Post, such as what she told reporters or whether or not she provided them with a copy of her therapist's notes.
Also of significance is Ford's claim that she wished to remain confidential since she submitted her assault allegations to a person operating the Washington Post's tip line. She testified that she did this due to a ""sense of urgency,"" claiming she did not know how to contact the Senate Judiciary Committee. However, she was unable to explain how she knew to contact the offices of Feinstein and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.).
Also, Ford cannot recall if she was recorded, via audio or video, during the administration of her polygraph, nor can she remember if the polygraph was administered on the same day as her grandmother's funeral or the day after.
""It would also have been inappropriate to administer a polygraph to someone who was grieving,"" Mitchell said.
8. Ford’s description of the psychological impact of the event raises questionsFord testified that she suffers from anxiety, PTSD, and claustrophobia, which explains her fear of flying. However, she testified that she has flown many times in the last year, and flies on a regular basis for her hobbies and work.
Meanwhile, Ford testified that the assault affected her academically in college. However, she never claimed it affected her in high school after the assault allegedly occurred.
""It is significant that she used the word 'contributed' when she described the psychological impact of the incident to the Washington Post. Use of the word 'contributed' rather than 'caused' suggests that other life events may have contributed to her symptoms. And when questioned on that point, said that she could think of 'nothing as striking as' the alleged assault,"" Mitchell explained.
Finally, Mitchell said the ""activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford’s attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford’s account.""

        PA-Sen: 'Economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job,' Barletta says at Trump rally
    President Donald Trump came to Pennsylvania for a ""Make America Great Again"" rally Wednesday to campaign for U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, the state's Republican nominee for U.S. Senate.
And with Trump standing by his side, Barletta lauded the president's accomplishments in front of an enthusiastic Erie crowd — particularly the ""soaring economy.""
What did Barletta say?""Each time that you come, the list of 'promises made, promises kept' gets longer and longer, and that's OK with us because now you're overseeing the greatest economy in American history,"" he told Trump as the audience cheered.
Barletta — one of the early supporters of Trump during his presidential campaign — noted the gross domestic product is at 4.2 percent, unemployment is at 3.7 percent, that 4 million new jobs were created, that black and Hispanic unemployment is at an ""all-time low,"" and female unemployment is at a ""64-year low.""
""And this is the stat I love the most: 4 million Americans came off of food stamps,"" the congressman said, adding that ""there are more jobs than people who are unemployed.""
Colin KaepernickThen Barletta let loose with a zinger.
""I'll tell you how good the economy is,"" he said. ""This economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick found a job.""
Kaepernick is a former NFL quarterback who in the 2016 season launched the movement of players kneeling for the national anthem to protest police brutality and oppression of people of color. He hasn’t played since the end of that season but has become a left-wing icon and landed a spot on Nike’s 30th anniversary “Just Do It” campaign.

Barletta blasts CaseyBarletta is running against Sen. Bob Casey Jr. in November's midterm election and said the incumbent Democrat ""wants to stop"" the progress Trump has made and ""became one of the most liberal senators in Washington.""
""He no longer represents Pennsylvania values,"" Barletta said of Casey. ""I'll tell you how radical he has become. He is so radical that he said he will vote 'no' no matter who the president nominates for the next Supreme Court pick ... if you don't like the way Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh has been treated, then you can't reward Bob Casey by sending him back to Washington ever again.""
At the tail end of his Supreme Court confirmation process, Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, who said the alleged incident occurred when they were teenagers over 35 years ago. The charge led to wall-to-wall media coverage and contentious hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the high court Saturday.
'We are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag'""We're gonna take care of our seniors, we're gonna protect the unborn, we're gonna put an end to illegal immigration, we're gonna build the wall ... and we are going to kneel when we pray and stand for the flag,"" Barletta concluded as the cheering hit a fever pitch. ""No, Mr. President, we're not tired of winning in Pennsylvania; we're gonna win again in November.""

        Hillary Clinton: 'You cannot be civil' with GOP—but 'civility' can resume if Democrats win Congress
    Hillary Clinton said Tuesday ""you cannot be civil"" with Republicans and that ""civility can start again"" if the Democrats win back the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, or both come November.
What else did she say?In her interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Clinton added that Republicans only seem to respect ""strength"" — and have been out to destroy what she holds dear politically.
""You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,"" the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee said. ""That's why I believe, if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again. But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.""
Clinton also took shots at President Donald Trump and GOP leaders for how they ""really demeaned the confirmation process"" of newly sworn-in Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, saying they ""insulted and attacked not only Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford"" — who claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers over 35 years ago — but also ""women who were speaking out.""
Then the former first lady really got rolling:
Here's the clip:
<U+FEFF>
This writer's perspectiveWhat proceeded from Clinton's mouth in this interview grew progressively more astonishing with each uttered word — mostly because just about everything she said is applicable to Democrats.
For instance, would Democrats in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee have exhibited the civility of even considering an additional hearing had a Democratic president nominated a liberal judge to the Supreme Court who was then accused of sexual assault three decades prior on the eve of the confirmation vote?
Was Clinton in the kitchen baking cookies like Tammy Wynette when it was revealed that Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein had Ford's letter for well over a month prior to its 11th-hour leak to the media, which smelled badly of an attempt to either delay or derail Kavanaugh's confirmation?
Was Clinton binge-watching her 2016 campaign speeches when Kavanaugh was questioned in front of the planet about beer, flatulence, and high school yearbook entries? Who again was doing the demeaning?
And while she was lamenting the so-called attacks endured by Ford, did Clinton plum forget that multiple women not only accused her husband of sexual assault but also that she famously brushed off such allegations as ""bimbo eruptions""? Believe all women, eh?
Oh, and ""ideological party ... driven by the lust for power""? Is she kidding?
In her defense, Clinton noted later that ""you can be civil, but you can't overcome what they intend to do unless you win elections.""
She's right about that — with a crucial alteration: Indeed, Republicans can't overcome what Democrats intend to do unless Republicans win in November.
Gotta hand it to you, ""Madam President"": Your words, if nothing else, continue to fire up the very people you want to see defeated — to say nothing of the millions out there who just may pay special visits to the polls and vote Republican next month in your honor.

        Mark Judge responded to the Senate Judiciary Committee after the hearing — here's what he said
    After the emotional and explosive hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified about her allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, Kavanaugh's high school friend Mark Judge reached out to the committee again.
Judge, still unwilling to testify publicly, sent a letter to the committee reinforcing his stance on the allegation and responding to repeated calls during the hearing from senators who want him to testify.
""As I stated in my attorney, Barbara Van Gelder's September 18th, 2018, letter, I did not ask to be involved in this matter nor did anyone ask me to be involved,"" Judge wrote.
What did he say about the hearing?Judge apparently paid attention to the hearing, but nothing he heard changed his stance on the allegations Ford has made. From the beginning, Judge has denied any knowledge of what Ford has accused Kavanaugh of. Ford has testified that Judge was also in the room when Kavanaugh allegedly sexually assaulted her.
""Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school, but we have not spoken directly in several years,"" Judge wrote. ""I do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.""
Why won't he testify?Numerous times during Thursday's hearing, senators asked to hear from Judge and asked why he wasn't being questioned by the committee.
""I think asking to have the other individual involved in your assault, Mark Judge, appear before us today was not asking too much,"" Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said.
Judge said that due to his personal issues, he has no desire or intention to testify publicly.
""As a recovering alcoholic and a cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety,"" Judge wrote. ""As a result, I avoid public speaking.""

        Lindsey Graham: If there's a SCOTUS vacancy during Trump's last year, I will keep it open
    During an interview on Wednesday at The Atlantic Festival, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) said that if a Supreme Court seat opened up during the year before President Donald Trump's presidency ended, he would keep that seat open until the next administration took over.
What did Graham say?Speaking with The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Graham said:
Goldberg interrupted him, ""You're on the record.""
""Yes,"" Graham responded. ""Hold the tape.""

Graham could be trying to ease concerns of potential swing votes in the Senate such as Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) or Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). While she has not indicated if it would impact her vote, Collins told reporters that she thought “the president's comments were just plain wrong” at a rally Tuesday in Mississippi.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) also called the president's comments about Christine Blasey Ford “appalling” and “wrong.” However, Flake is expected to vote yes if the FBI cannot find evidence by the end of its investigation to corroborate claims make by the women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Graham is up for election in 2020, the same year that Trump is running for re-election.
He also brought up how Democrats treated Clinton accusers in the '90sDuring the interview, Graham said also that while he didn't “like what the president said last night,” “everything Trump said was factual,” and that Ford was treated “respectfully” while Kavanaugh was “treated like crap.” When this was met with boos from the audience, Graham shot back, “Yeah, well, boo yourself.”
Graham argued that the way Democrats treated former President Bill Clinton accusers was far worse than how Ford was being treated:
The trailer park quote comes from Democratic operative James Carville, who responded to accusations of rape against Bill Clinton by Paula Jones by saying “if you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you'll find.”

But Yahoo News wasn't paying attentionYahoo News originally attributed this quote to Graham himself instead of to Carville in an initial tweet which read:
The audience gasps.4. @YahooNews tweet which doesn’t even mention that it’s a Carville quote is still up pic.twitter.com/R4Ry5xG6t6— Yashar Ali <U+0001F418> (@yashar) October 3, 2018This tweet has since been deleted. Yahoo News subsequently tweeted that the deleted tweet “did not accurately reflect the context of Lindsey Graham's quote.”
What else?Graham also criticized his Democratic colleagues for their handling of Ford:
That last part of Graham's quote refers to the fact that Ford indicated during her testimony that she was not aware that Senate Republicans had volunteered to send people to privately interview her in California rather than have her fly to Washington, D.C., to testify publicly.
Graham noted that he had voted for Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan and argued that he “would never have done to them what's been done to this good man.”

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/25/gop-hires-arizona-sex-crimes-prosecutor-to-question-ford-and-democrats-cry-foul-heres-why","
        GOP hires Arizona sex crimes prosecutor to question Ford -- and Democrats cry foul. Here's why.
    Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) revealed the identity of the ""experienced sex crimes prosecutor"" the GOP members of the Senate Judiciary Committee hired to question Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, according to a news release.
The GOP hired Rachel Mitchell, deputy county attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona, who specializes in the prosecution of sex-related felonies.
Democrats aren't pleased with the GOP's decision to hire a prosecutor to question Ford rather than having the senators do it themselves.
""Dr. Blasey Ford isn’t on trial,"" Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter. ""This hearing is to determine whether Kavanaugh is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. By hiring a private attorney to cross-examine Dr. Blasey Ford, Republicans are trying to intimidate her and avoid being held accountable by voters.""
Why did the GOP pick Mitchell?Grassley said in his statement that the decision to hire outside counsel to question Ford was made, at least in part, to avoid a ""circus"" environment that existed in the early September Kavanaugh hearings (like Sen. Cory Booker's ""I am Spartacus"" moment).
""The goal is to de-politicize the process and get to the truth, instead of grandstanding and giving senators an opportunity to launch their presidential campaigns,” Grassley said. “I’m very appreciative that Rachel Mitchell has stepped forward to serve in this important and serious role.""
Grassley’s statement also highlighted why Mitchell’s experience was relevant to this hearing.
Will Ford even show up?Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) cast doubt about whether Ford would show up to testify on Thursday, citing the use of an outside prosecutor to question her.
Feinstein told Fox News on Tuesday that she has ""no way of knowing"" whether Ford will show, and Ford's attorney slammed the decision to bring Mitchell into the hearing.
""This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate,"" attorney Michael Bromwich said. ""Neither Dr. Blasey Ford nor Judge Kavanaugh is on trial. The goal should be to develop the relevant facts, not try a case.""

        Christine Blasey Ford questioned during morning testimony in front of Senate Judiciary Committee
    Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault in the early 1980s, began her testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Here's what you need to knowThe Republicans brought in Rachel Mitchell, an outside prosecutor who specializes in handling cases involving sex-related crimes. Republican senators deferred their time to Mitchell, so that she could question Ford. Meanwhile, Democrats questioned Ford on their own.
Mitchell asked Ford about specific details regarding both the incident, and the point at which she came forward.
The flight questionsIn one of the more remarkable moments in the line of questioning from Mitchell, Ford seemed to say that she had not been informed that Senate Republicans had offered to come to her in California, rather than requiring her to fly to Washington D.C.
Ford had previously expressed a fear of flying, which she said was based on claustrophobia  caused by the alleged assault. Ford said that she had finally been “able to get up the gumption” to fly to D.C., but that this fear had caused her initial unwillingness to speak before the committee.
“I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request,” Ford said.

Mitchell questioned Ford about her frequent travels to places like Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands, and Polynesia, which supporters of Kavanaugh had used to cast doubt on her stated unwillingness to fly. Ford testified that it was easier to make these trips when she was heading to something more enjoyable like a vacation.
After giving Sen. Amy Klobuchar time to speak, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Ford if she was aware that he had been willing to send people to talk to her in California.
“Dr. Ford,” Grassley said, “I want to correct the record, but it's not something that I'm saying that you stated wrongly because you might not know the fact that when you said that you didn't think it was possible for us to go to California as a committee or our investigators to go to California to talk to you, we did, in fact, offer that to you, and we had the capability of doing it. And we would have done it anywhere or anytime.”
Ford thanked Grassley, but seemed to be unaware of this fact.
In a letter sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) dated Sept. 19, Grassley said that he had extended an offer to Ford to send people to California to interview Ford there. This letter was posted on Grassley's website the same day. Grassley wrote:
What else?Mitchell also tried to get Ford to clarify other details, including how she got to the party, how she got home from the party, when she first contacted the media and her congressional representative, and the circumstances under which she took her polygraph test.
With only a slim majority in the Senate, Republicans will need to make sure that no members of their own party decide to vote against Kavanaugh or abstain.

        Alan Dershowitz says 'no evidence whatsoever' that Christine Blasey Ford's allegations are true
    Famed attorney and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said during Friday's ""Fox & Friends"" that there's ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the '80s while the two were high school students.
Ford, now 51, accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in letters to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July, shortly after Trump chose Kavanaugh as the nominee for Supreme Court justice. Feinstein — the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee — eventually turned Ford's letter over to the FBI.
What did Dershowitz say?During Friday's ""Fox & Friends,"" Dershowitz said that despite Ford's vociferous accusations, there doesn't appear to be any evidence beneath them.
Dershowitz also added that he's disturbed by the automatic belief in Ford's allegations by some people on television.
""There’s no evidence whatsoever, even under her story, of attempted rape,"" he explained. ""Attempted rape under Maryland law requires a specific intent to, I have to use this word — penetrate. There has to be that specific intent.""
""Here, the allegation is groping, touching, fondling. Maybe trying to remove clothing,"" he added.
""He has an opportunity obviously to deny that,"" Dershowitz said. ""He has categorically denied it. The most disturbing thing is these people who are on television. Some people I know and respect, 'I believe her!' You've never met her! You don't know anything about her!""
Dershowitz went on to question whether women should automatically be believed simply because they're women.
""Are women born with a special gene for telling the truth and men with a special gene for lying?"" he asked. ""I don't believe her. I don't believe him. I have an open mind. I want to hear both sides of the story and make a determination.""
""That's what the American system of justice is all about,"" the famed law professor added.

Here's more background on the allegationsFord said she attended a house party with Kavanaugh and other teens at a Maryland home in 1982. Ford said that Kavanaugh pushed her into a bedroom along with another male companion. She alleged that Kavanaugh locked the door, put on loud music to muffle the sound, and attempted to remove her clothing.
She said that Kavanaugh and his male friend, who were reportedly drunk, laughed about the incident. At one point, Ford said that Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to keep her from making noises. She later revealed that she thought he might inadvertently kill her during the alleged incident.
Kavanaugh flatly denied Ford’s allegations. “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” he said.
Ford's attorneys have opened negotiations with the Senate Judiciary Committee on a possible appearance next week in front of the committee. Kavanaugh has said he wants to testify again in front of the committee.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday,” Kavanaugh said on Monday.
The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Kavanaugh.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/19/sen-mazie-hirono-tells-men-to-shut-up-and-step-up-for-once-says-republicans-are-treating-ford-unfairly","
        Sen. Mazie Hirono tells men to 'shut up and step up'; says Republicans are treating Ford unfairly
    Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) called for ""the men in this country"" to ""shut up and step up"" on Tuesday during a news conference, RealClearPolitics reported.
The Senate Judiciary Committee member's comment referred to her perceived response from Republican men about the sexual assault allegations lobbed against Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist in northern California.
""I just want to say to the men of this country: Just shut up and step up. Do the right thing — for a change,"" Hirono said.
Ford, a registered Democrat, has alleged that a drunk Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a house party in the 1980s while they were in high school. She also claimed that she was afraid he might ""inadvertently kill me"" during the alleged incident.
The 51-year-old Democrat sent letters with her claims to Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in July — shortly after President Donald Trump chose Kavanaugh as his nominee for Supreme Court justice.
But it wasn't until Friday that the accusations against the federal judge were made public. 
What did Hirono tell reporters?Hirono told reporters that she believes Ford is being victimized for coming forward.
""I think we all know when something is not fair when something smells. And we all know this. Let's face it, this is so patently unfair to her and what really bothers me and gets me so angry that the White House is victimizing this person. Why don't we get that out there? That why should we participate in the victimization of someone who has the courage to come forward? And she is under absolutely no obligation to participate in a smearing of her and her family. And that is why I am very clear about what needs to happen.""
The senator went on to say that she would ""expect"" the media to talk about the unfair treatment of Ford by Republicans, adding that she doesn't consider that as editorializing.
""But at the same time, you know, if the Republicans go forward with their plan to railroad this and to fast-track as they have so many other nominations, I expect the members of the press to talk about how unfair this all is. I don't think that is editorializing, that is laying out some facts. I expect that from you guys,"" she continued.
A reporter asked Hirono whether or not it helped that there are women on the committee if Ford agrees to participate in a public hearing. The senator is one of four women on the Judiciary Committee.
""Of course, it helps that there are women on that committee, but you know what? I expect the men in this country and the men in this committee and many of them believe me because we all signed on to this letter to demand an FBI investigation. But, really, guess who is perpetuating all of these kinds of actions? It's the men in this country.
""And I just want to say to the men in this country: Just shut up and step up. Do the right thing — for a change,"" Hirono said. ""You can see I’m a little bit upset by this, the unfairness of it.""
What does Kavanaugh say?Kavanaugh has adamantly denied the allegations and is willing to testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Supreme Court nominee has been through six federal investigations over the course of his public career, according to The Associated Press.
“I have never done anything like what the accuser describes — to her or to anyone,” Kavanaugh said on Monday in a statement. “Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.”
Ford's accusations allegedly took place at a party more than 35 years ago. Kavanaugh was reportedly 17 at the time, and Ford was 15.
What did the White House say?“On Friday, Judge Kavanaugh ‘categorically and unequivocally’ denied this allegation. This has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement,"" the White House statement said.
What else?On Tuesday night, Hirono blasted the White House on Twitter.
""The entire array of the White House's power is behind Judge Kavanaugh. It not only places Dr. Blasey Ford at a disadvantage, it victimizes her. No survivor of sexual assault should be subjected to death threats and concern about the safety of their family,"" she wrote.

        Oklahoma pro-abortion billboards are turning heads, and here's the approach they're using
    A pro-abortion group has placed head-turning billboards along busy interstates in Oklahoma City, according to published reports.
What group is promoting them?Emma Newberry-Davis, a spokesperson for Reproductive Justice, said the billboards went up Monday and will remain in place for a month. They not timed with any political activities, she told The Oklahoman.
But the billboards are tied to confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to Newberry-Davis. Abortion-rights advocates fear Kavanaugh’s conservative leanings could tip the high court to the right and possibly reverse or weaken the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
Reproductive Justice claims the campaign is part of a faith-based initiative to raise the voices of clergy members who want to show they support women regardless of whether they decide to have an abortion.
The non-profit group’s promotional signs are concentrated on Interstate 35 and Interstate 44 both north and south of Oklahoma City.
Eight billboards in the area feature messages such as “People of faith love those who have abortions” and “God loves those who have abortions.”
Religious groups that oppose abortion are more prevalent in Oklahoma.

Has this happened elsewhere?Oklahoma's billboards appeared after a billboards by a different group caused a stir in Dallas, Texas, TheBlaze previously reported.
The Afiya Center kicked off a controversy after posting a Facebook photo of its billboard that states “Abortion Is Self-Care.” Pro-life advocates strongly opposed the billboard’s message, and its use of black women in the ad.
In response to the billboard, pastor Stephen Broden and the Black Pro-Life Coalition put up a billboard that states: “Abortion is not healthcare. It hurts women and murders their babies.”
According to the Right to Life Michigan website, percent of all abortions in the U.S. in 2014 were performed on black women. In contrast, just 13 percent of the total population is black.
Planned Parenthood’s website states that about 360,000 of its 2.4 million patients are black.

        WATCH: Joe Biden dismissed FBI reports as 'hearsay' in Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing
    Senate Democrats and the women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct continue to call for the FBI to investigate the claims — but Sen. Joe Biden from 1991 would push back against that demand, based on an old C-SPAN video that resurfaced Tuesday.
The video shows a much-younger Biden directing some animated remarks toward eventual Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and his fellow committee members during his confirmation hearing.
""And the last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn't understand anything,"" Biden said in the video.
Watch below:

What else did he say?The Daily Wire provided more quotes not shown in the above video clip, as Biden, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee gave his thoughts on the value of FBI information in determining the validity of Anita Hill's accusations against Thomas.
And from the video clip:
Biden's worst moment?The San Francisco Chronicle called the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings Biden's ""worst moment as a senator.""
Thomas was accused by his onetime colleague in a federal agency, Anita Hill, of long-running sexual harassment. Biden allowed Judiciary Committee members to savage her during questioning during the Thomas hearings and refused to call witnesses who were prepared to back up Hill’s testimony.That was all dusty history — until Christine Blasey Ford showed up. Now everyone is looking back at Anita Hill, and Biden’s performance hasn’t aged well. Even he knows it — he has said he owes Hill an apology.Even his sort-of apology doesn't fully take responsibility for any perceived wrongs in that hearing, as Biden lamented that he ""couldn't have stopped"" the attacks on Hill, saying ""I wish I could have done more"" to prevent the harsh questions she was asked.
“I never attacked her, I supported her, I believed her from the beginning and I voted against Clarence Thomas,"" Biden told NBC's Today last week.

        Leftists who posted clip of Ted Cruz, wife harassed at dinner: 'You are not safe. We will find you.
    The leftist group that posted video of Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi being harassed and eventually driven out of a Washington, D.C., restaurant Monday night later added a chilling promise to Cruz, President Donald Trump, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and ""right-wing scum"" in general:
 Image source: Twitter
Smash Racism DC added an appeal to call a phone number it said belongs to controversial conservative pundit Gavin McInnes and to ""tell him you love white genocide.""
 Image source: Twitter, redacted
Given that Twitter permanently banned the accounts of Alex Jones and his InfoWars site for ""reports of Tweets and videos ... that violate our abusive behavior policy,"" TheBlaze on Tuesday reached out to Twitter to see if the same standard might be applied to the Smash Racism DC posts but didn't immediately receive a response.
Here's the rest of the Smash Racism DC thread:
 Image source: Twitter
What happened to Cruz?The protesters shouted at Cruz and his wife, apparently angry about the impending vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Video showed several protesters screaming “we believe survivors!” and making reference to women who've come forward accusing the judge of sexual misconduct.
“God bless you, ma’am,” Cruz said.
Soon the Texas Republican senator and his wife departed the restaurant, identified by Smash Racism DC — as well as by numerous news outlets — as the upscale Fiola.
TheBlaze on Tuesday didn't immediately hear back from Fiola regarding if it had a comment on Cruz and his wife getting harassed or if it took any action against the protesters.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/20/commentary-i-am-a-sexual-assault-survivor-no-we-should-not-believe-all-women","
        Commentary: I am a sexual assault survivor. No, we should not 'believe all women
    “Believe all women.”
In the last week, this pious new mantra of the left has been used to completely dismantle an honorable man’s reputation. It’s incredible really, the idea that, in the year 2018, your biological makeup entitles you to be believed even in the absence of one shred of evidence.
Set aside for a moment that the notion is completely contrary to the American idea that we are all innocent until proven guilty, the suggestion that we should “believe all women” is also dangerously irresponsible.
We are told by the left that there are no differences between men and women, that gender is fluid, that women are as capable as men in all circumstances, even though science proves that to be completely untrue. And yet, one of the only ways women are, in fact, equal to men is that we are not infallible. We are not inherently virtuous. We are not morally superior. We can remember things incorrectly, or not remember things at all.
Some women lie, cheat, and steal just as some men do. Some women are manipulative. In fact, some of the most conniving people I’ve known throughout my life have been women (this is admittedly entirely anecdotal). But the idea that we should believe all women simply because they have a different set of genitalia is utterly ridiculous.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his family have gracefully endured insults, vulgarities, deceptively edited smear campaigns, and flat out character assassinations since July, when President Donald Trump first announced he was nominating Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. But the left’s latest attempt to destroy him for an unfounded sexual assault accusation is a new low.
I am a sexual assault survivor. I was assaulted multiple times during childhood between the ages of 12 to 16, over two decades ago. I can’t say with 100 percent certainty that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford is purposely asserting the allegations against Kavanaugh to intentionally thwart his nomination, none of us should jump to that assumption. What I can say is that I have never forgotten the details of being assaulted. Never would I have to say, “I can’t recall how I ended up at the party,” or “I don’t remember what happened after the assault.” I don’t have the luxury of forgetting those details; they’re etched in my mind forever.
No amount of “investigating” by the Senate Judiciary Committee will yield any kind of proof-positive results, as Democrat leaders certainly already know. The Ford-Kavanaugh incident allegedly happened over three decades ago. A friend of Ford claims she remembers hearing about an “incident” all those years ago, yet backed off those claims a mere 24 hours later. Another friend Ford named as a “witness” claims he has no knowledge of the incident and was never at a party as Ford described. A mutual friend at the time, Mark Judge, categorically denies that it happened. These are the convoluted stories we would expect 30-something years later.
All of this is enough to cast reasonable doubt on her accusations. Reasonable doubt: that standard to which we are supposed to judge someone’s guilt or innocence in this country. No, we shouldn’t blindly “believe all women.” On the contrary, if women (or men, for that matter) accuse someone of something so vile that it would immediately ruin their reputation, we have to expect clear and convincing evidence before we convict anyone in the court of public opinion and permanently tarnish their reputation.
To believe all women is to minimize the experience of real survivors. Sexual assault survivors withstand a lifetime of far-reaching effects, but so do the falsely accused. In either situation, one person's life is negatively impacted forever. It is imperative that political games don’t allow us to lose sight of that.

        Vice president faced with unruly mob of protesters — video shows him handling it like a true patriot
    Vice President Mike Pence kept his shoulders high and squared on Saturday despite anti-Kavanaugh protesters screaming and marching against Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.
What happened?Instead of leaving the Capitol building through a side door after Saturday's historic confirmation, the vice president decided to face the demonstrators head-on and, with dignity, walked straight out of the building's front entrance and waved.
The anti-Kavanaugh protesters — many of who shrilled ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" were gathered outside of the building and in addition to screaming profanities, many demonstrators also threw the middle finger at those politicians exiting the building.
When Pence walked out, according to Fox News, those people who were demonstrating their angst and anger increased in frequency and volume.
Pence reportedly stopped for a moment, and assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Jim Morehand reportedly told the vice president that an alternate exit was available if Pence preferred.
Pence began to turn, according to the report, but he stopped and issued a three-word command: ""Let's do it.""
Pence and his security detail proceeded down the front steps of the building and approached his motorcade, waving at the angry crowd all the way.
The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday a 50-48 vote.
What did Pence do?On Twitter, Fox News' Chad Pergram documented the incident.
Pergram wrote, ""After Kavanaugh vote, Pence walked from the chamber with his detail to the exit which would open the doors up to the Senate steps. They swing the doors open … and all you can see is a throng of protesters across the plaza ... and hear are protesters shouting 'Shame! Shame! Shame!'""
""As Pence stands in doorway of Capitol at top of Senate steps, protesters across the plaza spot him and start shouting louder,"" Pergram added. ""His motorcade waits at the bottom of the Capitol steps.""
Pergram added that the vice president was ""indecisive"" for a moment, but quickly made up his mind.
""Pence stands for a moment in Senate doorway, indecisive, w/protesters hollering,"" Pergram wrote. ""Pence then reverses course to exit Capitol another way. Pence walks a few steps. Pivots & says 'let’s do it.' Pence then defiantly walks down the Capitol steps and waves to Kavanaugh protesters.""

        TN-Sen: Taylor Swift announces endorsement based on women's issues, but there's a twist
    Pop star Taylor Swift announced in a surprise post on Instagram Sunday that she is supporting former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, in the crucial race for Tennessee's U.S. Senate seat. In doing so, Swift denounced Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican who is challenging Bredesen.
Unfortunately for Swift, social media users quickly pointed out a flaw in her endorsement reasoning.
What did Swift say?Declaring her support for LGBT rights while denouncing radical, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination, Swift said Blackburn's voting record in Congress ""terrifies"" her.
""As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me,"" Swift wrote to her 112 million Instagram followers.
After accusing Blackburn of having ""voted against equal pay for women"" and a bill that ""attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape,"" Swift ripped Blackburn's stance on LGBT issues and stated, ""These are not MY Tennessee values.""
Instead, the music legend explained Bredesen, a moderate Democrat who could very well win the Senate seat from Republicans, is the right man for the job.
""I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives,"" she said. Cooper is the incumbent congressman for Tennessee's 5th Congressional District, which includes Nashville. He is a Democrat.
 
 
A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 7, 2018 at 4:33pm PDTWhat's the irony?As people pointed out on social media Sunday, Swift's endorsement of Bredesen, which she in part attributed to Blackburn's apparent lack of support for women's causes, comes after Bredesen offered up some support of his own.
Last week, Bredesen announced that he supported the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Bredesen remained silent for months, issuing his statement in the final hours before a key procedural vote that laid the foundation for Saturday's confirmation vote.
Bredesen said that he initially supported Kavanaugh's nomination — although he never stated that support publicly — and believed Kavanaugh remained qualified for the Supreme Court after numerous women raised unsubstantiated allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh.
It's not clear if Swift supported Kavanaugh or if she was aware that Bredesen did.
How did Blackburn respond?The Blackburn campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze.
Will Swift's endorsement move the needle?Presumably, given her influence, she likely persuaded some Tennesseans to reconsider their support for Blackburn, although it's impossible to know for sure.

        Mitch McConnell has a warning for Democrats if they win back the House
    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a warning to congressional Democrats on Wednesday, cautioning them against behaving too aggressively toward President Donald Trump if they win back the House of Representatives in November.
McConnell, aware of the significant chance Democrats have of regaining control of the House, said they could face backlash in 2020 if they abuse their power in 2018 and 2019.
""This business of presidential harassment may or may not quite be the winner they think it is,"" McConnell told the Associated Press.
What does he mean?In recent weeks and months, some Democrats have promised to use any congressional influence they have to investigate Trump, his businesses, his finances, and even his most recent Supreme Court appointee.
McConnell believes Democrats' zeal to use a House majority to go after Trump could actually make it easier for him to get reelected, and cautioned them against overestimating the public's support of such actions.
The Kentucky Republican said he was speaking from experience. He referenced Republicans' attempts to take down former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s with a Republican-controlled house. Their impeachment of Clinton was less popular among the public than they hoped.
""It worked exactly the opposite. The public got mad at us and felt sympathy for President Clinton,"" McConnell told AP.
What are Democrats planning?Democrats have been frustrated throughout Trump's term by their inability to control or begin investigations into things like potential collusion with Russia, Trump's taxes, or his businesses.
That could all change if they win back the House. David Faris writes in The Week:
Outside of Trump, more than one Democratic congressman has pledged an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the sexual assault allegations against him.
""As soon as Democrats get gavels we're going to want to get to the bottom of this,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said late last month of the allegations against Kavanaugh.

        CNN anchor has a bizarre reaction to liberal protesters being called the 'm-word
    CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin was visibly upset that a guest criticized the extreme behavior from left-wing protesters against Brett Kavanaugh, and called them ""the m-word.""
'Let me move past the m-word'Baldwin was discussing the political climate with conservative commentators Mary Katherine Ham and Matt Lewis when she appeared offended at the use of a certain word to describe protesters. Lewis used the example of obnoxious demonstrators screaming and yelling at Sen.Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his wife as they tried to eat dinner in Washington, D.C.
""I believe it's the overreaction of the left,"" Lewis said, ""when you see people like Ted Cruz being chased out of restaurants by a mob...""
""Oh, you're not gonna use the mob word here,"" Baldwin interrupted.
""It's totally a mob! It is without a doubt!"" he responded.
""Matt. Matt,"" she scolded.
""There's no other word for it!"" Lewis said.
""Matt. A mob? Stop! Stop! A mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia, two Augusts ago,"" she interjected, referring to an ""alt-right"" demonstration where a man rammed his car into left-wing counterprotesters and killed a young woman.
""No, I think both!"" Lewis objected.
""A mob is not what we saw chasing ... I'm not saying what they did was right,"" Baldwin added.
'Weaponization' on the right""What about the people that were on the Supreme Court, banging on the walls what do you call that?"" Lewis continued. ""Civil protest? Or is that a mob? I think it's easily a mob.""
""Yeah, and if it were TeaPartiers, we'd call it a mob for sure,"" said Ham. ""Let's be serious.""
""Let me move past the m-word, because I do feel like that is part of the weaponization of what's happening now on the right,"" Baldwin said.
Watch the bizarre debate in the video below:
Many supporters of Brett Kavanaugh, including Republican members of Congress, have referred to the protesters as a ""mob,"" after they began to actively harass lawmakers in public. In another video that circulated widely on the right, frustrated protesters angrily clawed at the giant doors at the Supreme Court.

        Melania on #MeToo: ‘Need to have really hard evidence,’ because ‘sometimes the media goes too far’
    First lady Melania Trump minced no words when ABC's Tom Llamas asked how she felt about the ever-evolving #MeToo movement during her solo tour of Africa.
Defending both men and women, Trump decried the media sensationalism when covering such delicate topics.
What did she say?In a one-on-one interview with Trump in Egypt, Llamas asked the first lady her thoughts on #MeToo and supporting women.
The interview came in the wake of the controversial hearings in which Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended himself from allegations of sexual assault in the early 1980s.
Llamas asked, ""What is your take about the #MeToo movement ... do you believe in [the women], do you support the #MeToo movement?""
Trump responded that she does support the women behind the #MeToo movement — but noted that she supports men, too.
""I support the women, and they need to be heard,"" Trump began. ""We need to support them.
""And also, you know, also men. Not just women,"" she added
Llamas responded by asking if Trump felt that men accused have been treated unfairly as a result of the #MeToo movement.
""We need to have really hard evidence that, you know, that if you are accused of something, show the evidence,"" she answered.
Llamas said that some people might take the first lady's statement to mean that she doesn't actually support women.
Trump fired back, ""I do stand with women. But we need to show the evidence. You cannot just say to somebody, 'I was sexually assaulted' or 'You did that to me,' because sometimes the media goes too far in the way they portray some stories. It's not correct. It's not right.""
What else?The one-on-one special, ""Being Melania — The First Lady,"" airs Friday at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.
You can watch a preview of the special — and the first lady's remarks — in the video below.

        University puts prof who tweeted death wishes for white GOP senators on immediate ‘research leave’
    C. Christine Fair, the Georgetown University professor who tweeted that white GOP senators involved in the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “deserve miserable deaths,” has been placed on ""research leave,"" according to school officials.
Twitter temporarily suspended professor C. Christine Fair’s account after her words went viral, but the university initially defended her.
What's happening now?A spokesperson for Georgetown University sent an email out to students on Friday, noting that the ""mutual"" decision for Fair to go on ""research leave"" was ""effective immediately.""
Joel Hellman, dean of the Walsh School of Foreign Service, wrote an email, which, in part, read, “This has been a challenging moment for our community, as we balance our unwavering commitment to free speech and expression with the need to ensure civil and respectful discourse.
""We can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery, profanity, and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse. Such expressions go against our core values,"" Hellman's email continued.
“Earlier today, I spoke with Professor Fair. To prevent further disruption to her students and out of an abundance of caution for the security of our community, we have mutually agreed for Professor Fair to go on research leave effective immediately,"" the dean's email said. ""Professor Fair will accelerate previously scheduled international research travel.
“It’s become clear that incivility begets incivility. While we have received many legitimate concerns from members of our community and beyond regarding the social media posts Professor Fair has made in her personal capacity,” Hellman wrote, and noted that the school had also received “provocative and threatening” statements in response to Fair's Twitter conduct.
“This has been an emotional time, and I hope you will join me in thanking those at the front lines for handling their responsibilities with professionalism, tact, and patience,” Hellman concluded. “I want to reiterate a message that I make to every entering class at [the School of Foreign Service]: while we teach diplomacy as a subject, we expect diplomacy as a community.”
On Friday, the university's student-run newspaper, The Georgetown Voice, tweeted about Fair's leave.
The tweet read, ""NEWS: Professor C. Christine Fair and SFS Dean Joel Hellman 'mutually agreed to Professor Fair to go on research leave effective immediately,' according to a statement from Hellman.""

She concluded the graphic tweet with “Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”

        Human resources study shows a stunning unintended backlash to the 'MeToo' movement
    A study shows that there are stunning consequences to the ""#MeToo"" movement against sexual harassment that the proponents probably didn't foresee and definitely will not support.
A backlash that will limit opportunities for womenThe Society for Human Resource Management published a report Thursday that documented the result of the movement that called on society to believe allegations of sexual harassment without question.
According to the study, nearly a third of executives report that they have ""changed their behaviors to a moderate, great or very great extent to avoid behavior that could be perceived as sexual harassment.""
The CEO of the SHRM, Johnny C. Taylor Jr., explained that ""some of the more concerning pieces of data that came out of the research are around the concern that there may be a backlash of sorts.""
""There were men who specifically said I will not hire a woman going forward,"" he explained.
""Those who said they would hire a woman said they would not travel with one, and they, more importantly they would not engage in activities after business hours,"" Taylor added.
""And you know oftentimes, that's when the relationships are built,"" he continued, ""after hours dinners with clients, et cetera, trips, I'm a lawyer for example, and you know, you're the associate, and the partner won't travel with you for fear that it could be perceived, or he could be subject to a sexual harassment claim.""
Here's the video of the SHRM CEO explaining the findings:
A culture of 'guilty until proven innocent'
Taylor said that companies need to be careful about how to implement new policies because of the #MeToo  movement.
""We can't let the pendulum swing too far,"" he explained. ""Organizations must be careful not to create a culture of 'guilty until proven innocent' and we cannot tolerate other unintended consequences.""
That is exactly the criticism that many supporters of Justice Brett Kavanaugh made, including some lawmakers, about the allegations made against him in order to derail his nomination. Kavanaugh was sworn in to the Supreme Court on Monday.

        NV-Sen: Rosen still introducing herself to Nevada late in the race against Sen. Heller
    The Nevada Senate race has been marked as one of the most important races in the nation from the beginning.
First-term congresswoman Jacky Rosen is thought by many analysts to represent Democrats’ best chance to flip a Republican seat by defeating Sen. Dean Heller.
But with the election just one month away, Rosen is still climbing the same hill she’s faced since she got in the race — getting people to know who she is.
Milling among a crowd celebrating Mexican Independence Day in a park, Ms. Rosen, the Democratic Senate nominee for Nevada, had much on her mind. But to get voters to listen, she needed to make an impression first, with precious little time left before the November election.
'Hi, I’m Jacky,' she said over and over in a hot breeze that smelled like corn dogs — the world’s best, if you trusted the truck making them. An aide motioned for someone to take a picture. 'I’m Jacky.'
Some people nodded. Others looked confused.""Despite her strong performance in polls so far, and the high profile nature of her race, Rosen is a much more understated and less-discussed candidate nationally than someone like Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has gained a national profile while challenging Sen. Ted Cruz.
According to The New York Times, that understated profile is considered an advantage by both Republicans (“I think you have to have a very compelling reason to get rid of an incumbent U.S. Senator, and there isn't one.” said Sig Rogich, a Republican strategist in Nevada) and Democrats (""Ms. Rosen’s supporters view her as a viable alternative, a left-of-center Democrat whose biography and sparse voting record leave Republicans with little to attack. ... If Ms. Rosen is understated — more Mojave Desert beige than Las Vegas neon — that, her backers say, is the point"").
The Kavanaugh dilemmaRosen attempted to gain some political points on Heller by highlighting a controversial remark Heller made about sexual assault allegations. The Senator referred to the allegations as a ""hiccup"" for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to get past, before later clarifying that he didn't mean to dismiss the seriousness of the allegations.
But even the polarizing Kavanaugh situation may not have as much of an impact on Nevada voter turnout, for either side, as it will in other states. Nevada, while won by Hillary Clinton by 2 points in 2016, is somewhat of a ""purple"" state politically.
A poll released on Oct. 1 shows Rosen has a 3 point advantage among registered voters and a four point advantage among ""likely voters,"" and an analysis from September on RealClearPolitics points out the precarious position Heller appears to be in.
The Cook Political Report lists the Nevada Senate race as a ""toss up.""

        WATCH: Lindsey Graham throws down the gauntlet, challenges Chuck Schumer in fiery interview
    Democrats have already threatened to investigate — or even try to impeach — Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh should they retake control of the House after November's midterm elections.
On Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) responded to the news by throwing down a challenge to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
What did Graham say?At first, when asked about the threat, made primarily by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) who is the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, Graham vowed to campaign against his congressional colleagues in the run up to November's elections, something he said he's never done before.
""I've never campaigned against a colleague in my life. That's about to change. I'm gonna go throughout this country and let people in these, you know, purple states, red states where Trump won know what I think about this process,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Then host Chris Wallace asked Graham about a list he brought on set. Wallace was referring to the list of potential Supreme Court nominees that President Donald Trump released last year.
""What's your point?"" Wallace asked.
Graham responded with force, issuing a direct challenge to Schumer.
""Here's my point. This is a list that was compiled in November, but [Trump] actually put it out during the campaign. There are 20-something people on this list. I'm asking Chuck Schumer: name five, name three, name one that would be okay with you,"" Graham said.
He explained:
Brett Kavanaugh was a mainstream judge. I would have chose him if I'd been president. Bush supported him. Everybody running for president on our side believed that Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch were outstanding conservative jurists.
The other side wants to cancel the election. So Chuck, you want somebody new? Look at this list, and see if there's anybody you agree to — but what you want to do, Senator Schumer, is to overturn the election and you pick the judges. We're not gonna let you pick the judges. If you wanna pick judges, then you need to win the White House.
When Obama won, I voted for two judges that he picked. So Chuck Schumer, name one person on this list you think's acceptable.Watch Graham's fiery response below:

        IN-Sen: New poll shows incumbent Dem. Joe Donnelly leading Republican Mike Braun by just 2 points
    A new Fox News Poll shows incumbent Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly with a slight lead over Republican businessman and former Indiana state Rep. Mike Braun in their U.S. Senate race.
What are the details?The poll revealed that 43 percent of likely voters plan to vote for Donnelly in the November general election, and 41 percent plan to back Braun.
Seventy-seven percent of Braun's supporters say they are certain in their vote for him, while 74 percent of Donnelly supporters said the same.
Libertarian Lucy Brenton polled at 6 percent, and 8 percent of respondents say they are undecided.
What about the Kavanaugh debate?SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh is also at the center of the debate, and the poll noted that should Donnelly vote against Kavanaugh, 30 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for Donnelly.
Thirty-two percent of voters said they would be less likely to vote for Donnelly in such a case, and 34 percent of voters said Donnelly's vote on Kavanaugh would make no difference.
After September's Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, Donnelly announced that he would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Donnelly has yet to publicly announce whether he'll change his mind in light of the FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, but it seems doubtful.
On Tuesday, the Washington Post's Seung Min Kim — a White House reporter — tweeted that Donnelly has yet to flip-flop on his initial ""no.""
She wrote, ""I’ve been asking whether @SenDonnelly could change his opposition to Kavanaugh since it hinged much on lack of FBI probe and now there is one. Here’s what a senior aide tells me this morning.""
The aide responded, ""Joe also has serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh's temperament and impartiality. He's ready to work with President Trump on a new nominee, but he remains opposed to this one.""

The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, and was conducted online Sept. 29-Oct. 2 among 806 registered Indiana voters.

In a previous NBC News/Marist poll, Donnelly led Braun by about 6 points.
Trump officially endorsed Braun in September during a campaign rally in Evansville, Indiana.
The Senate election in Indiana is one of 10 “most likely to flip in 2018,” CNN reported in January. The Cook Political Report calls the race a toss-up, as does Real Clear Politics.
Donnelly and Braun will face off in their first debate on Monday. The second debate is set for Oct. 30.

        Liberal website editor defends tweets mocking Rep. Steve Scalise for getting shot
    The senior editor of left-wing website Raw Story is defending inflammatory comments he made on Twitter, including his statement that House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) ""deserves a Darwin award nomination"" for continuing to support gun rights after being critically shot by an attacker last year.
What are the details?Responding to a report that Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.)'s wife was sent a text message showing someone being beheaded following the lawmaker's vote to confirm U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Scalise tweeted on Sunday, ""These vicious threats have to stop. This cannot be the new normal."" He called on Democrats to condemn the continued threats against Republicans.

        Trump mocks former Sen. Al Franken for quitting so quickly after sexual misconduct allegation
    Many of President Donald Trump's most notable quotes come from his rallies, and Thursday night's stop in Rochester, Minnesota, was no different.
Trump took a moment during the rally to mock former Democratic Sen. Al Franken, who resigned last year in the midst of a sexual misconduct scandal — comments that probably drew more attention than normal as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's explosive confirmation process draws to a close.
""[Sen. Tina Smith] took a wacky guy's place,"" Trump said. ""Boy, did he (Franken) fold up like a wet rag, huh? Man, he was gone so fast. He was gone so fast, I don't want to mention Al Franken's name, okay, so I won't mention it.
""It was like 'I did something? Oh, I resign, I quit.' Wow, he was gone, and he was replaced by somebody nobody had ever heard of,"" Trump continued.
Franken resigned due to backlash over a photo showing him groping a sleeping woman. Several other women also said Franken forcefully groped or kissed them without consent.
Some Democrats are calling hypocrisy on Republicans for calling for Franken's resignation and then pushing forward with Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation. A key difference, however, is that there was photographic evidence of Franken's misconduct, while there has been little or no corroborating evidence supporting the sexual assault accusations against Kavanaugh.

Other topics Trump addressed at the rally:

        Democrats cave to Republican deal, hand Trump another victory — and liberals are furious
    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave Democrats an ultimatum on confirming judicial nominations by President Donald Trump, and they caved in order to go home sooner.
Here's what happenedThe deal was leaked when under consideration on Thursday.

""Lots of chatter that Senate could leave today and not return until the lame-duck session after the elections,"" reported Manu Raju of CNN.
""McConnell and [Chuck]Schumer [D-N.Y.] still need to strike a deal on a package of executive branch and judicial nominees the WH wants confirmed. If no deal, Senate will be back next week,"" he added.
Liberals recoil in horrorActivist liberal groups demanded that Democrats not give in to the deal offered by Republicans when it was under consideration.
President of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Vanita Gupta, demanded Democrats hold the line on nominees in a statement Thursday.
“If the Senate is serious about the federal judiciary, each senator must reject attempts to confirm these lifetime nominees without adequate time and debate,"" Gupta said.
""We expect senators to work, to fight for us and to stand up for what is right. Not catch the first flight out of D.C. so they can advance their personal political standing,"" said Shaunna Thomas, the executive director of UltraViolet.
Liberal activist website Daily Kos decried the idea in an article titled, ""Dear Chuck Schumer: Do not make a deal for more Trump judges.""
Make McConnell work for everything. You would have plenty of Democratic senators willing to stick around D.C. to gum up the Senate works while your red state incumbents could go home and campaign. They need you to be fighting McConnell, particularly after the Brett Kavanaugh debacle.Despite the liberal outrage, Democrats unanimously agreed to the deal in order to go to their home districts sooner and campaign for the midterm elections.
The deal meant confirmation for 15 of Trump's judicial nominees — 3 circuit court judges, and 12 district court judges.
""I don’t understand this,"" tweeted Vox News' Matt Yglesias.  ""Couldn’t everyone in cycle go home while a dozen senators with safe seats rotate to hold the floor and refuse unanimous consent?""
""15 lifetime appointments. 84 judges in total. No matter what happens in the midterms or in 2020, Trump has completely reshaped the courts and Schumer and the Democrats share some of that responsibility,"" responded LGBT activist Joel Kim Booster.
""Disgusting, tbh!"" he concluded.

        Ocasio-Cortez is asked for her 'plan' for Congress - her answer is a word salad mess
    Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared on MSNBC in the wake of the stunning news about Brett Kavanaugh heading towards confirmation, and gave a jumbled bizarre word salad of an answer for an important question. 
""Really thinking about that word, organizing...""
Ocasio-Cortez spoke to Chris L. Hayes on his show about the aftermath of Kavanaugh's impending confirmation to the Supreme Court. 
""You're going [to Congress] at a time when people talk about how its broken,"" said Hayes, ""and its so polarized, both of which I think are true, and you're also coming really as an outsider at a moment where I think people like are watching what happened today, and they want to storm the gates, and you're gonna actually do that."" 
""So what's your plan here?"" he asked. 
""Well I think a lot of it has to do with changing our strategy around governance,"" Ocasio-Cortez responded. 
""You know there's a lot inside baseball,"" she tried to explain, ""and inside the beltway, you always hear that term thrown around, but there are very few organizers in Congress and I do think that organizers operate differently, it's a different kind of strategy. 
""And what it is really about organizing, and and really thinking about that word, organizing,"" she repeated, ""segmenting people, being strategic in their actions."" 
""In really bringing together a cohesive strategy of putting pressure on the chamber instead of only focusing on the pressures inside the chamber,"" she concluded vaguely.  
""That's really an interesting thought,"" responded Hayes. 
Here's the video of Ocasio-Cortez repeating the word ""organizing"" a lot:

Ocasio-Cortez was mocked by many of her critics on the right recently for making comments about her being ""inaugurated"" into Congress, but it appeared that she was joking when she made the statement. 
The Democratic Socialist will almost certainly win her election and end up in Congress, since, as Hayes noted, the district she's running for is very heavily democratic.

        Students rally and demand USC professor be fired for saying ‘accusers sometimes lie’
    Student protesters are demanding that a long-time USC professor be fired after he said that ""accusers sometimes lie"" in an email that went campus-wide.
What's the email all about?USC professor James Moore, who has been teaching at the university since 1988, expressed his belief that sexual assault accusers sometimes, in fact, do lie.
Moore's made the statement in a response to an email invitation to a Title IX-related campus event. The event, “Coffee and Title IX,” which was organized by Price Women and Allies, was designed to encourage people to believe all women who say they are survivors of sexual assault, according to the Daily Trojan. The invitation highlighted Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as an example.
Moore's response — which went to the entire Price School of Public Policy — read, “If the day comes you are accused of some crime or tort of which you are not guilty, and you find your peers automatically believing your accuser, I expect you find yourself a stronger proponent of due process protections than you are now,” Moore wrote, according to the paper.
“Accusers sometimes lie,” he added.
What about the protesters?Now students are demanding that the school terminate Moore over the email.
Joelle Montier and Audrey Mechling rallied approximately 30 students on Monday in demand that the university fire Moore. Montier told the gathering of students marching to the school's Lewis Hall that Moore is a ""rape enabler"" and needed to be fired immediately.
""To be clear, I take no joy in standing here and sharing my most painful memory with the world, but I refuse to stand by and let another human being go through what I went through,"" Montier said. ""Rapists must be held accountable for their actions. Rape enablers, like Professor Moore, must be held accountable for their actions.""
Mechling later added that she believed Moore to be a ""pitiful excuse of a professor"" whose email ""broke her.""
Did school officials respond?The group marched to confront the school's dean with their demand.
Jack Knott, the dean of Price School of Public Policy, even called Moore's email ""insensitive and incendiary.""
He added that Moore's email response ""is not a question of free speech.""
“The statement made — that accusers lie — in my opinion showed a lack of sensitivity to the current climate, here at the [u]niversity and in communities across the country,” Knott said. “The issue here is not a question of free speech, but a question of respect for the students and other members of the Price School community.”
Knott also met with protesters and promised that he would improve the school's apparent bias.
""Thank you for making this a very important issue, highlighting this and taking the time,"" Knott said, according to the publication. ""I've had literally hundreds of emails from all kinds of people telling their stories, and I want to hear those stories.""
He added, ""I take all of this very seriously.""
Did Moore respond to all of this?Moore told the outlet that he didn't think the rally's aim to have him fired wasn't very well considered.
""The whole point of a university is that it's a place for points of view and discourse, and if they happen to disagree, the way to respond is to engage rather than terminate the source of the information that you disagree with,"" Moore reasoned.
He added, ""My primary objective was protecting the interests of folks who might be falsely accused of misconduct. My goal was protecting students, not traumatizing or bullying them.""
Moore also said, “I’m a little concerned about the direction that our [Title IX] procedures might go. The prospect of automatically believing every accusation just seems to be an untenable way to approach adjudication in these cases.”
It is unclear at the time of this writing whether Moore will face any disciplinary action.

        New analysis reveals just how negatively the media covers Trump — and what positives they ignore
    A new analysis scrutinizing the mainstream media's coverage of President Donald Trump reveals just how negatively the top evening newscasts covered the Trump administration this summer.
What are the details?The analysis, from conservative media watchdog Newsbusters, found that 92 percent of stories on the Trump administration from June 1 to Sept. 30 were covered negatively. Analysts reviewed 1,007 stories, which equated to 1,960 minutes of airtime, from the NBC, ABC, and CBS evening newscasts.
Surprisingly, two-thirds of all coverage focused on five stories:
 	 	 	 	 	What did media mostly ignore?According to the analysis, NBC, CBS, and ABC spent only 14 minutes — which equates to 0.7 percent — on the booming economy under Trump, which features record low unemployment, surging wages, small business growth, and record stock market achievements.
In fact, the analysis found that in regard to economic stories, the networks most often covered Trump's tariff war — a story not favorable for the president.

        GOP leadership disagrees on whether they'd try to confirm a Supreme Court justice in 2020
    Fresh off the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, questions arose about what Republicans might do if another vacancy opens on the court in 2020 — and Republican leadership doesn't agree on what they'd do in that situation.
In 2016, Democrats attempted to fill the vacancy resulting from the passing of former Justice Antonin Scalia. Then-President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland, but Republicans used their majority to prevent Garland from even getting a Senate hearing. He never had a shot of being confirmed.
At the time, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the American people should have a say in the direction of the court, meaning no judge should be confirmed until a new president is elected.
""One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy,'"" McConnell famously said in August 2016.

This week, McConnell left open the possibility that Republicans could confirm a nominee even in an election year, saying it wasn't about the fact that it was an election year; rather, it was about which party was in control of Congress.
“The Senate in the hands of one party and the White House in the hands of another in a presidential election year,” McConnell said, according to the Washington Examiner. “That is what we had in 2016.”
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has a different perspective on the issue.
Grassley told Fox News on Tuesday that the committee would not take up a Supreme Court nomination in an election year if he is still the chairman.
His reason? Because of what the party did in the case of Merrick Garland's nomination.
""Because I pledged that in 2016,"" Grassley said. ""That's a decision I made a long time ago.""

        MN-Sen: Karin Housley calls for investigation into allegations against Rep. Keith Ellison
    Minnesota U.S. Senate candidate Karin Housley (R) has officially called for the state attorney general's office to launch an investigation into domestic abuse allegations against Attorney General hopeful Rep. Keith Ellison (D).
What are the details?Ellison serves as deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and faces accusations of physically and emotionally abusing former girlfriend Karen Monahan in 2016. The allegations were brought by Monahan's son, who claimed in August to have found a video of Ellison abusing his mother; Monahan says the allegations are true.
Ellison announced last week that he would request the House Ethics Committee look into the accusations he faces. He told BuzzFeed, ""I am taking this step now because I am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved.""
Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party is currently awaiting the findings of an independent investigation it launched two months ago.
But Housley, who is challenging incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) in the Nov. 6 election, says those investigations are inadequate.
""Recent calls for a congressional ethics investigation, made by Keith Ellison and echoed by my opponent, amount to nothing more than political cover,"" she said in a statement. ""Ellison will have left Congress by the time an investigation could be completed.
""These are serious, recent and substantiated allegations that deserve immediate attention and raise significant doubts about Keith Ellison's fitness to serve as Minnesota's chief legal officer,"" Housley added.
Ellison denies the allegations against him, which Housley used against her rival by comparing them to the sexual assault denials maintained by U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
""Tina Smith said Judge Brett Kavanaugh 'committed sexual assault' and called for a 'quick and thorough investigation' into the allegations made against him, despite the judge's repeated, emphatical denials. But curiously, Tina Smith has chosen to believe Keith Ellison's 'categorical' denials, affirming her support for him and openly campaigning with him,"" Housley said.
Several Republicans in recent weeks have accused Democrats of hypocrisy for believing Kavanaugh's accusers but ignoring the claims against Ellison. Kavanaugh is currently undergoing a supplemental FBI investigation regarding allegations that he sexually assaulted accuser Christine Blasey Ford at a party in 1982.

        Twitter suspends prof who said white GOP senators ‘deserve miserable deaths’ as university weighs in
    Twitter has suspended Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair after she posted a violent diatribe targeting white GOP senators at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing last Thursday.
The university also spoke out and issued a statement on her conduct.
What's the latest?If you attempt to visit Fair's Twitter page at the time of this writing, no tweets are visible and you are redirected to an ""account suspended"" landing page.
Fair's Twitter page — prior to the suspension — described her as a “[s]cholar of South Asian pol-mil affairs, inter-sectional feminist, pitbull apostle, scotch devotee, nontheist, [and] resister.”
Twitter presumably suspended Fair's account after outcry over her inflammatory tweets about GOP senators deserving ""miserable deaths"" for their roles in the Kavanaugh hearing.
Georgetown University issued a statement on Fair's tweets on Monday.
A spokesperson for the university said, ""The views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities are their own and not the views of the University.""
""Our policy does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,"" the statement continued. ""While faculty members may exercise freedom of speech, we expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful, respectful dialogue.""
What did she say, anyway?On Saturday, Fair wrote, ""Look at thus [sic] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps.""
She concluded the graphic tweet with “Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
Look at thus chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement.

Yes. https://t.co/tT7Igu157y— (((Christine Fair))) (@CChristineFair) September 29, 2018According to a Sunday post by Campus Reform, Fair responded to a female reporter's request for comment in a lengthy post on her blog, “Tenacious Hellp***y.”
In her response, Fair wrote, “There is a war going on against women and you, and your despicable herd of so-called journalists seeking to protect male privilege and shame women for our victimization or our rage are complicit in this war.”
Fair explained that she was not calling for violence against any senators and was “merely speaking to what my spirituality says these vile souls deserve.”

        After all that testimony, it still comes down to who you believe
    Finally, yesterday was the big day. After two weeks of sniping that felt like two months, the Senate Judiciary Committee finally heard testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford.
After all the allegations, innuendos, exclusive interviews, and negotiations, Americans had the chance to make up their minds whether Brett Kavanaugh is worthy of being nominated to the Supreme Court, or whether he's a scumbag. Actually, people's minds were already made up before a single question was asked. And that was the frustrating part of the eight-hour-long charade – there is no way to discern the absolute truth about what allegedly happened 36 years ago.
RELATED: HOME RUN: It's time to #ConfirmKavanaughNOW!It was a big moment for the nation Thursday, with no real upside. Nothing was really resolved, except to check the box that both the accused and the alleged victim had the opportunity to testify. It was really just a political show. And boy did we get a show. One highlight was Sen.Cory Booker suddenly showing a love for the Declaration of Independence when he quoted, ""our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor."" Maybe he thinks that's a Spartacus quote.
Republicans tried to point out the political gamesmanship of Democrats in their desperation to block Kavanaugh. Democrats tried to convince America that Democrats have a monopoly on caring for women.
In the end, it was all very predictable.
In their questioning of Ford, Democrats reiterated Ford's ""heroism"" in coming forward with her allegation. Ford received no tough questions from Democrats because they believe her story unconditionally. Now the trend is to believe survivors at all cost.
But it wasn't always that way. They conveniently forgot how the left never believed Juanita Broaddrick's sexual assault allegation against former President Bill Clinton.
Democrats also repeatedly complained about the lack of an FBI investigation into Ford's story. But short of time travel, it's hard to understand how they think the FBI would be able to discover anything conclusive about 36-year-old generalized allegations. And let's be honest, if these allegations against Kavanaugh have any merit, and the FBI never found a hint of them through multiple previous background checks, then the FBI is dangerously incompetent.
Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), reminded the room of Kavanaugh's previous FBI background checks, but it doesn't matter, because minds were already made up.
The alternating format of the hearing, bouncing between Republican and Democratic senators made it impossible to truly examine Ford's claims. Every five minutes, serious questions from prosecutor Rachel Mitchell were interrupted by glowing tributes from Democrats about Ford's bravery and heroism. When it was Kavanaugh's turn, the hearing format provided relief from the SNL-like absurdity of Democrats grilling him about teenage inside jokes from his 1982 high school yearbook.
For his part, Kavanaugh was emphatic and surprisingly emotional during his opening statement. He forcefully denied Ford's accusation. He was clearly annoyed by the Democrats' role in turning his confirmation hearing into a circus, and blamed them for ruining his family's life over the past two weeks.
Ford came off looking like a confused damsel in distress. She was often flustered and could barely answer a question without advice from her two lawyers. Still, she was mostly believable.
Kavanaugh came off looking understandably angry and rattled at times. His answers to all the questions about his high school beer consumption didn't do him any favors. Yet, he was also believable.
There was a lot of talk yesterday about what the hearing was not – that it wasn't a court trial, nor was it really a job interview for Kavanaugh. What it was, for the most part, was a complete joke.
UPDATE: Here's how the discussion went on radio. Watch the video below.

        Former Democratic aide arrested, suspected of leaking GOP senators' personal info
    Capitol Police have arrested the man suspected of releasing the personal phone numbers and home addresses of Republican senators during last week's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, according to The Hill.
Jackson A. Cosko, a former aide who has been employed by several Democratic congresspeople recently, was arrested and charged with making public restricted personal information, witness tampering, unauthorized access of a government computer, identity theft, second degree burglary, unlawful entry, and threats in interstate communication.
Last week, someone made anonymous edits to the Wikipedia pages of Sens. Lindsey Graham, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, as well as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, while Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Some of the information was inaccurate, according to The Washington Post.
A Twitter account called @congressedits automatically tweets out any updates that are made to Wikipedia pages from computers on Capitol Hill — which means the account tweeted out the personal info of the Republican congressmen. The account was quickly suspended for doing so, even though it was just an automatic function.
Cosko most recently worked for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) as recently as September, and previously worked for Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and retired Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). According to his LinkedIn page, he stopped working for Hassan in May 2018. He refers to himself as a ""Democratic Political Professional & Cybersecurity Graduate Student"" on the page.
Some suspected the doxxing came from Rep. Maxine Waters' office, but she denied the allegations and reportedly had an IT specialist verify that the violating IP address was not connected to her office.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/04/third-grade-chart-explains-consent-in-the-middle-of-a-hug-and-the-person-changes-their-mind","
        Third-grade chart explains consent: ‘[I]n the middle of a hug and the person changes their mind?’
    A third-grade teacher from Los Angeles has devised a simple chart for her students to figure out what ""consent"" actually means.
What are the details?Liz Kleinrock, a third-grade teacher at Citizens of the World Charter School Silver Lake, created the chart, which she shared on her Instagram page last week.
On her Instagram page, Kleinrock's bio reads, ""M.Ed. Elementary teacher. 2018 Teaching Tolerance Awardee. Social justice advocate. Anti-bias educator,"" and even includes her preferred pronoun, which is ""she/her.""
In sharing the chart, Kleinrock wrote, ""Everything about Kavanaugh in the news has been making me HEATED. So whenever I get frustrated about the state of our country, it inspires me to proactively teach my kids to DO BETTER. Today was all about CONSENT. We even explored the grey areas, like if someone says 'yes' but their tone and body language really says 'no.' Role playing is a great way to reinforce these skills, but they MUST be taught explicitly!""
The chart defines the word ""consent,"" and goes on to illustrate the definition with what consent is and is not, and when it is appropriate to ask for consent.
Consent is needed, according to Kleinrock's chart, for such things as giving hugs, borrowing things, touching another person, kissing, secrets, and sharing.
The chart also presents ""what if"" questions, such as ""What if you're in the middle of a hug and the person changes their mind?"" and ""What if the person says 'no,' but they're smiling?""
 
 
Everything about Kavanaugh in the news has been making me HEATED. So whenever I get frustrated about the state of our country, it inspires me to proactively teach my kids to DO BETTER. Today was all about CONSENT. We even explored the grey areas, like if someone says “yes” but their tone and body language really says “no.” Role playing is a great way to reinforce these skills, but they MUST be taught explicitly!A post shared by  Liz Kleinrock (@teachandtransform) on Sep 26, 2018 at 3:02pm PDTAnything else?In an interview with The Huffington Post, Kleinrock said, “I think whenever I tend to look at things spiraling in society, particularly political events that are going on, I like to think about what kind of foundational skills should have been in place earlier to prevent these things from happening.”
Kleinrock also said that her children engage in a role-playing activity in which she encourages the children to ask if they can give her a hug.
“I’m saying the word ‘yes,’ but my tone and my body language are so clearly uncomfortable so I ask, ‘Can you read my body? Can you read my face? How do you think I’m actually feeling?’” she explained. “Or I’m laughing and saying, ‘No, not right now.’ I look happy and positive, but the words coming out of my mouth are still no. It’s the tone and delivery.”
She also explained that she does not discuss sex with her third-grade class.
“People seem to have a really hard time with this because of the connection between consent and sex, but it never crossed my mind to talk about sex with my class,” she told the outlet. “My students are 8 and 9 years old. It’s really about respecting space and physical boundaries and interacting with each other.”

        Prof who tweeted death wishes for white GOP senators says it was an ‘experiment’—for Tucker Carlson
    The Georgetown University professor who tweeted that white GOP senators involved in the hearing of SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh ""deserve miserable deaths"" told the Washington Post that her disturbing tweet was simply an ""experiment.""
Twitter temporarily suspended professor C. Christine Fair's account after her words went viral, but Georgetown University defended her right to free speech.
What did she say?The Post reported that Fair said her tweet was an experiment to trap Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
Fair initially tweeted about the Republican senators on Saturday, writing, “Look at thus [sic] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
“Maybe this was not my most eloquent attempt [at an experiment],” Fair told the Post of her Twitter remarks in an interview published on Monday. “And I will certainly concede I was attempting to make people feel uncomfortable.”
Fair went on to defend her motives, saying that the “idea I’m somehow calling for actual violence is preposterous.”
“I set this up for Tucker Carlson. He proved my experiment,” she added. “It escalated in a way I hadn’t anticipated. But I knew exactly where it was going.”
This is where it gets interesting, right?Fair apparently checked enough boxes with her rhetoric that it did, indeed, catch Carlson's attention, and he spoke about her remarks Sunday night. Carlson talked about how the left was beginning to broaden its attacks on white men by calling for white genocide.
Tucker Carlson just warned his viewers about liberals advocating for white ""genocide"" pic.twitter.com/Te2wbpIjBo— Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 2, 2018One of Fair's apparent aims, according to the Post, was for Carlson to use the very term ""white genocide.""
By Tuesday, the Southern Poverty Law Center was blasting Carlson for using the term on his show and included his remarks in their ""Hatewatch"" headlines.
Today's @Hatewatch Headlines: Tucker Carlson warns of ‘white genocide’; Teaming up to track alt-right Bitcoin wallets; Reddit ‘quarantines’ white-nationalist subreddits; and more. https://t.co/vpVcuxSH2L— Southern Poverty Law Center (@splcenter) October 2, 2018This did nothing to deter Carlson from his previous stance, however.
In a Tuesday statement, Carlson said, “This is Orwellian. A Georgetown professor publicly calls for killing people based on their race, and then suggests ‘we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine.’ I criticize this and wind up on a ‘hate watch’ list?”
The Post added that Fair said her “rhetoric is designed to cause discomfort, not effect anything as naive as positive change in the world.""
At the time of this writing, Fair's Twitter account is up and running — and she's back at her rhetoric again.
What else?The university doesn't appear to have any immediate plans to punish the professor for the remarks.
In a Tuesday statement, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia said:
We protect the right of our community members to exercise their freedom of expression. This does not mean the University endorses the content of their expression. We can and do strongly condemn the use of violent imagery, profanity, and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender, ethnicity or political affiliation in any form of discourse. Such expressions go against our values.
While the speech of our faculty members is protected, we are deeply committed to having our classrooms and interactions with students be free of bias and geared toward respectful dialogue. We take seriously our obligation to provide welcoming spaces for all students to learn.
If comments made by faculty members are determined to substantially affect their teaching, research, or University service, we will address them through established University procedures outlined in our Georgetown University Faculty Handbook.

        Kimmel tells people Christopher Columbus recently confirmed to Supreme Court. They all believe it.
    Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel and his production team convinced Californians that the Senate recently voted to confirm the late Christopher Columbus to the Supreme Court, and didn't have to do much work to accomplish it.
What are the details?On Monday night's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" the host announced that his production team hit the streets of Los Angeles in order to gauge the public's opinion of the new controversial Supreme Court justice.
No, not that one, the 500-plus-year-old explorer, Christopher Columbus.
In introducing the segment — ""Lie Witness News"" — Kimmel said, ""You know, I mentioned Columbus at the top of the show, and Columbus is, I think, of all the historical figures, George Washington, Lincoln. Columbus might be the third that we learned the most about in elementary school, so people should know who he is, right?""
Wrong, apparently.
""There's a lot going on in the country, so we decided to combine two of the big things going on right now. We went out on the streets this afternoon and we asked people what they thought about Christopher Columbus being nominated to the Supreme Court,"" he explained, and introduced the segment.
In the video, one of the show's producers can be heard asking a young blonde woman on the street, ""Do you agree with Congress' controversial decision to confirm Donald Trump's nominee, Christopher Columbus, to the Supreme Court?""
The woman answered in the affirmative, and added, ""I just believe that it's so long ago in the past, and there's not enough evidence to back it up. ... Like, 30 years.""
The producer later asked a second person — this time a young man — and he answered, ""Sometimes, you just like ... it's a hard question. It's a hard case study. But, like, what are you going to do about it?""
The producer approached another young woman and said, ""In your opinion, do you think that the fact that Columbus discovered America, it should keep him off the Supreme Court?""
The woman answered, ""I would say yes, but I don't really understand why the reasoning would be.""
You can watch the rest of the answers and the full segment in the video below.

        Sen. Rand Paul talks political climate: There is ‘going to be an assassination’ next
    Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that he believes lawmakers should work together to achieve common ground in order to put out the fires that have erupted as a result of intense political back-and-forth and inflammatory rhetoric.
What are the details?During a Tuesday interview with Kentucky's WLAP-AM, Rand told radio host Leland Conway that he was worried that there ""is going to be an assassination"" as a result of the expanding political divide between Democrats and Republicans.
Paul, who believes that the ramped-up rhetoric is partly a result of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's hearings and subsequent confirmation, said that it's important for lawmakers to set the example and choose their words wisely.
""I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation ... they have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence,"" Paul told Conway.
For an example, Paul recalled how he was viciously assaulted by his neighbor in 2017.
He also pointed to the June 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice, in which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot and seriously injured.
""These are people that are unstable. We don't want to encourage them,” Paul said. ""We have to somehow ratchet it down and say we're not encouraging them that violence is ever OK.""
What about Booker's comments?Paul also touched upon Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and his July comments urging people to ""get up in the face of some congresspeople"" if they want to end homelessness.
""I think what people need to realize is when people like Cory Booker say 'Get up in their face,' he may think that that's OK,” Paul explained. ""But what he doesn't realize is that for about every 1,000 people who might want to get up in your face, one of them is going to be unstable enough to commit violence.""

        Black pastor: 'White women' who kneel for anthem to protest 'rape culture' are hijacking 'movement
    A left-wing black pastor warned ""white women"" who kneel during the national anthem to protest ""rape culture"" that they're ""highjacking [sic] a movement"" they ""took no risks for.""
Bishop Talbert W. Swan II added the following in a tweet Saturday: ""You didn’t kneel in solidarity to protest the murder of black people, don’t co opt & make it about your victimization. That’s white supremacy in the name of feminism""

Kneeling during the national anthem began with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the 2016 season, who said he was protesting police brutality and oppression of people of color. Kaepernick hasn't played since the end of that season but has become a left-wing icon and landed a spot on Nike's 30th anniversary ""Just Do It"" campaign.
The impetus for Swan's declaration about white women may have been a tweet from actress Molly Ringwald the previous day:

Ringwald made no distinction between the three singers' ethnicities in her tweet — and it followed her post the same day in which she called Sen. Susan Collins of Maine a ""betrayer of women,"" presumably for the Republican's announcement that she would vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court after Christine Blasey Ford's allegation he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers over 35 years ago.
What else did Swan have to say?Swan — who in June tweeted that “if heaven is going to be full of American evangelicals, I’ll take my chances on hell” — also ripped ""liberal white women"":
 Image source: Twitter
He also said ""white women participate in our oppression, yet try to appropriate the language & movements associated with it"" after calling out those who are ""randomly calling cops on black people for no reason"":
 Image source: Twitter
Swan — senior pastor of Spring of Hope Church of God in Christ in Springfield, Massachusetts, and assistant general secretary with the politically liberal Church of God in Christ denomination — took the following folks to task when they challenged him:

UPDATE: Tuesday, 7:46 a.m.:
Swan noted on Twitter Monday night that he never saw Ringwald’s tweet and is not a left-wing pastor.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/09/can-college-students-recall-conservatives-ever-shutting-down-liberal-speech-on-any-campus","
        Can college students recall conservatives ever shutting down liberal speech on any campus?
    It's easy to find examples of left-wing college students shutting down conservative speech and events on campuses around the country.
Indeed, First Amendment-denying kids have been invading spaces, chanting, and often resorting to violence over the last several years with ongoing, frequently chilling attempts to dictate what their peers say, see, and hear.
 Left-wing students shut down a speech at Vermont’s Middlebury College in 2017 featuring conservative writer Charles Murray — and a liberal professor, who agreed to engage Murray onstage, was injured by a mob outside the lecture hall. (Image source: YouTube screenshot)
Heck, if they could pull it off, many even might put the smack down on what conservative students think.
But all that hopefully begs a rather inconvenient question:
What about all those times conservative students rallied the troops and stormed into lectures by liberal speakers, started chanting ""the people...united...will never be divided!"" (or ""defeated""; feel free to chose your own lyrics) and kept up the shenanigans until liberals had to close up shop?
That's exactly what was on the mind of Campus Reform's Cabot Phillips, who showed up at the University of Georgia recently and offered students $100 if they could name just one example of conservative students shutting down liberal speakers on any campus.
How did the students respond?Let's put it this way: That $100 bill wasn't about to be, um, redistributed, to reference a recent commander in chief.
“No, I don’t think I can,"" one student answered, laughing. ""I wish I could, but no.”
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
""I don't think I'm going to get that $100,"" another student replied. ""I haven't heard of one yet.""
Givin' it the ol' college tryNot that some didn't attempt to make a case.
""I don't know, I just think that people are more open on the liberal side,"" one student began saying.
But Phillips jumped in: ""Wouldn't you say it's the conservative side that's more open minded if they're not rioting and trying to shut down events from liberal speakers?""
""Um, yeah,"" the student replied before catching himself being persuaded. ""I mean, I think it's both sides.""
Phillips asked another student if the utter lack of examples of conservatives shutting down liberal speech actually means conservatives are more tolerant.
""I think so,"" the student replied. ""I think if they did it they'd know there'd be more backlash.""
Another student decked out in a nifty bow tie — and who clearly needs more time in philosophy class — tried telling Phillips his argument was a ""red herring"" but seemed to have difficulty proceeding from there.
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
Yet another student similarly had trouble formulating a counterargument when Phillips suggested that liberal speakers can be divisive with the content of their speech.
 Image source: YouTube screenshot
Campus Reform said not one student was able to cite an example of conservative students shutting down liberal speakers on any campus.

        Twitter blasts retired astronaut for quoting Winston Churchill. Then he's ripped for apologizing.
    In the wake of the controversial Brett Kavanaugh hearings — during which the now-confirmed Supreme Court justice was accused of sexual assault — retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly hopped on Twitter to bemoan the divisive state of America.
 Retired Astronaut Scott Kelly gives a speech to celebrate the release of his memoir, ""Endurance: A Year In Space. A Lifetime Of Discovery"" at Breitling Boutique on Oct. 14, 2017, in New York City. (Photo by Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for Breitling)
Problem was, for some, he invoked iconic British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the process.
""One of the greatest leaders of modern times, Sir Winston Churchill said, 'in victory, magnanimity.' I guess those days are over,"" Kelly tweeted Sunday.
 Image source: Twitter
Well, a bunch of folks didn't appreciate Kelly quoting Churchill — who while having been lauded for standing against the Nazis in World War II also has been criticized for being ""a racist and white supremacist.""
The BBC noted that Churchill in 1937 said, ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""
Churchill also has taken hits for a Bengal famine as well as backing the use of chemical weapons against Kurds and Afghans, the BBC added, noting he said in a memo he's ""strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes.""
What did Twitter users say?So Twitter users let Kelly have it:
 	 	 	 	 	How did Kelly respond?So that same day, Kelly — a former fighter pilot who commanded the International Space Station on three expeditions — offered a follow-up tweet, this time apologizing for quoting the British leader:
 Image source: Twitter
""Did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill,"" Kelly wrote. ""My apologies. I will go and educate myself further on his atrocities, racist views which I do not support.""
How did folks react to Kelly's apology?Believe it or not, his apology tweet got way more attention — about 12,000 comments to his first tweet's roughly 600 — and a good bit of it highly critical of him apologizing.
Conservative commentator and feminist critic Christina Hoff Sommers offered a prominent but even-handed reply: ""Please don’t apologize. Winston Churchill, like all of us, had serious human failings. But unlike most of us—he possessed genuine greatness. And that greatness may have saved freedom & democracy. Ask the Twitter scolds to name a hero or heroine who didn’t have serious flaws.""
 Image source: Twitter
Others weren't so kind.
One commenter told Kelly to ""please read a good biography of Churchill before making pronouncements on his 'atrocities' and 'racist views.' He committed no atrocities and his views on race 100-years ago cannot be judged by today's standards — generational chauvinism. Are you lost...in space?""
Another said, ""The only atrocity is this apology you've written. This is exactly what's wrong with America, people like you who apologize and compromise principles to fit in and [appease] the insane and irrational. Remember Obama anyone? Dude, check your oxigine [sic] levels!""
""NASA wishes they had solar panels that folded this easily,"" another commenter said.
Also taking up the cause was this Twitter user: ""Oh good lord Scott, no one is perfect. Churchill was a giant of the 20th century in protecting freedom. The very fact that people criticize you for quoting Churchill provides the teaching moment that the quote represented.""

    President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that he had no intention of firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. After saying this, he flew with Rosenstein on Air Force One and said that the two had a “good talk.”
Rosenstein took over the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had been involved with the campaign, recused himself.
Rosenstein flew with Trump to a conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Florida. Before taking off, Trump told reporters:
Asked if he planned to fire Rosenstein, he said simply, “No, I don't.”
After the flight, Trump described his conversation with Rosenstein to reporters as “great.”
At his speech during the conference, Trump said:
&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F410437-trump-has-good-talk-with-rosenstein
This is a change from Sept. 21, when Trump implied that he would fire Rosenstein after a New York Times report that claimed Rosenstein had said he would consider using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.
“Just look at what is now being exposed in the Department of Justice and the FBI,” Trump had said at a rally, “look at what’s going on.” He speculated that “95 percent” of people at the department were “great people” although he added “but you got some real bad ones!”
Later, still speaking of the Justice Department, he added “there’s a lingering stench, and we’re going to get rid of that too.”

        Maxine Waters responds to report that her staffer doxxed GOP senators, blasts 'conspiracy theories
    Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), one of President Donald Trump's fiercest critics, has condemned accusations that one of her staffers leaked private information on three Republican senators.
During Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, an unknown person in the House of Representatives leaked, or ""doxxed,"" three Republican senators: Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Mike Lee (Utah), and Orrin Hatch (Utah). Personal information, including home and email addresses and cellphone numbers, were posted to each lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
According to Fox News, the home addresses were correct, but the phone numbers appeared not to be accurate.
Then on Saturday, a series of tweets alleged the IP address of the Wikipedia edits had been traced to one of Waters' staff members. The tweets went viral, garnering a mass of attention.
However, Waters said such a possibility could not be further from the truth.
What did she say?""Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,"" Waters said in a statement. ""This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.""
""I am utterly disgusted by the spread of the completely false, absurd, and dangerous lies and conspiracy theories that are being peddled by ultra-right wing pundits, outlets, and websites who are promoting a fraudulent claim that a member of my staff was responsible for the release of the personal information of Members of the United States Senate on Wikipedia,"" she added.
The Los Angeles Democrat explained the Capitol Police have determined the IP address responsible for the Wikipedia edits did not originate from her staff.
""The United States Capitol Police and our internal IT specialist have determined that the IP address in question does not belong to my office or anyone on my staff. The member of my staff — whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information,"" she said. 
""My office has alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims,"" Waters declared. ""We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed, and that they will be held legally liable for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff.""

        New York Times under fire for poll asking about Ford’s testimony credibility — so paper apologizes
    The New York Times has apologized after many of its social media followers criticized the paper's poll questioning Christine Blasey Ford's testimony credibility.
What was the poll all about?On Thursday, the New York Times shared what some readers considered to be an ""insensitive"" poll asking social media users whether they believed Ford's testimony, which took place on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The poll simply stated, ""Christine Blasey Ford is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee today. Do you find her testimony credible?""
After receiving much backlash for the tweeted poll, the Times apologized.
“We’re sorry for this tweet. In retrospect, a Twitter poll is insensitive in light of the gravity of this hearing. We’ve deleted it,” a follow-up tweet read.

The Times later tweeted that they plan to pose the same question about the credibility of Kavanaugh's testimony, though they have already deleted the initial poll about Ford's credibility.
""We also recognize that asking only about Dr. Blasey's credibility was inappropriate. We had intended to tweet a second poll about Judge Kavanaugh's credibility this afternoon.""

        DC restaurant hires security after protesters harassed Ted Cruz and owners received death threats
    The owners of a Washington, D.C., restaurant have hired security guards in the wake of protesters who harassed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and his wife, Heidi Cruz, while they dined last week.
""We are now living in the aftermath of this PR disaster,"" Fabio and Maria Trabocchi wrote in an email to customers, The Dallas Morning News reported. ""The restaurants will be getting security guards for the time being to avoid similar instances.
""Maria and I have personally received death threats,"" the email continued.
Cruz and his wife were forced out of Fiona, an Italian restaurant, by a group of protesters on Sept. 24.
""Together they surrounded the senator’s table and chanted slogans at him and his wife. They were politically motivated, loud, and disruptive,"" the restaurant's owners wrote. ""They were also potentially a danger not only to the senator but to our other customers and to our property and so, as is our policy, our managers called the police and eventually escorted the senator outside away from the protesters when it was safe to do so.""
What were they protesting?The protesters were screaming at Cruz about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual misconduct.
""We believe survivors,"" some protesters chanted in videos shared on social media.
Why did the restaurant hire security guards?Following the incident, the owners said that some media outlets had ""suggested that we [Fiona] intentionally leaked his [Cruz] presence to the protesters.""
""How insane to imagine we choose to host an attack in our own restaurant! As crazy as that idea is, the negative effects of the repetition of this false statement is unprecedented in our careers,"" Fabio and Maria Trabocchi wrote.
The restaurant ""operates in a city where politics is the main industry. We cannot stay open if we don’t welcome everyone regardless of party affiliation,"" they explained. ""We take our hospitality seriously and dole it out generously to all comers.""
They have also temporarily deactivated the restaurant's social media accounts.
Staff at all five restaurants owned by the couple are being trained on how to handle similar events in the future.

        Liberal talk show host praises Trump for new trade deal with Mexico, Canada: ‘Winning’
    Liberal late-night TV show host Trevor Noah had some genuine praise for President Donald Trump's new, renegotiated trade deal with Mexico and Canada on Monday night.
The new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — or USMCA — was reached on Sunday after months of negotiations.
What did he say?Noah celebrated Trump for securing a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico in a monologue that was rife with praise.
""Believe it or not, this weekend, Donald Trump — for the first time — delivered on the winning part,"" Noah explained, pointing to positive media coverage of the new trade deal.
Explaining that the new deal would require that Canada permit American farmers greater dairy market access, Noah applauded the president for effectively protecting U.S. jobs.
""People said it would be bad to elect a bully as president, but now America is literally taking Canada’s milk money,"" Noah said. ""So I guess it worked. It worked.
""Jokes aside, this deal looks like it will help American car makers and farmers, and protect a lot of U.S.-based jobs,"" he continued. ""I don't know if this is historic news for the entire world, but it is a big deal, so I understand why Donald Trump wanted to take a victory lap.""
Unable to resist a joke at the president's expense, Noah added, ""And clearly, he took the victory lap inside a tanning bed.""
You can watch the Comedy Central host's remarks in the video below.

Anything else?Noah isn't the only liberal singing Trump's praises for the new trade deal.
On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said that Trump deserved praise for the new deal.
""As someone who voted against NAFTA and opposed it for many years, I knew it needed fixing,"" Schumer said. ""The president deserves praise for taking large steps to improve it.
""However, any final agreement must be judged on how it benefits and protects middle-class families and the working people in our country,"" he added.
Schumer noted that he wants to see the enforcement of labor provisions.
""Two areas where I particularly want to see the details are dairy, where our dairy farmers are being taken advantage of by Canada, and real enforcement of labor provisions,"" Schumer explained. ""Labor provisions are good, but too often they are written into trade bills and never enforced.""
He concluded, ""If a final agreement is signed by all three countries, I also look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to write ‘implementing legislation’ to ensure the deal actually achieves these goals.""

        Owner of restaurant where Cruz was harassed says staff got death threats — but last laugh is on mob
    The owner of the Washington, D.C., restaurant where U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his wife were harassed by a leftist mob Monday night said his employees have received “life-threatening” messages over the incident, which went viral after being caught on cellphone video.
“Personally, I am blessed to work with the staff who have handled the harassment and life-threatening messages we and our families have received in the wake of the event,” Fabio Trabocchi of the upscale Fiola said in statement Wednesday posted on Twitter. “They have shown remarkable grit and calm. It is scary to hear anger directed at you and those you love — I am lucky to work with brave people who respect our work.”
What happened?The protesters shouted at Cruz and his wife Heidi, apparently angry about the impending vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Video showed several protesters screaming “We believe survivors!” and making reference to the women who’ve come forward accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
“Cancel Kavanaugh for women’s rights! For every marginalized community!” one protester hollered.
“Senator, I have a right to know what your position is on Brett Kavanaugh!” another protester yelled at Cruz.
“God bless you, ma’am,” Cruz said before he and his wife departed Fiola.
TheBlaze on Tuesday didn’t immediately hear back from the restaurant regarding if it had a comment on the incident or if it took any action against the protesters — but Fiola's Wednesday statement sheds more light on what went down behind the scenes.
<U+FEFF>
A surprise ending that may stick in the leftists' crawTrabocchi noted that authorities were contacted and that staff worked to clear out the protesters who were disguised as patrons sitting at the bar.

In addition, he said Cruz and his wife were soon ""discreetly"" brought back into Fiola to finish their meal.
Additional safety measures also have been implemented “across our restaurants to ensure the ongoing and future privacy, safety and security for our staff and guests,"" Trabocchi added in his statement.
“We did our best Monday night to show DC what it means to live, love, and work in a city where all voices are welcome — and quite necessary — to make a republic work,” he also noted in the statement. “It takes everyone. Just like any family. It requires respect, listening, and sometimes a little etiquette, like keeping your elbows and politics off the dinner table.”

        Ted Cruz put the Dems on blast for their handling of Christine Blasey Ford's letter
    Sen. Ted Cruz came out swinging on Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Thursday at the hearing for Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh. He brought up the fact that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had just told the committee that the only people she had given her statement letter to was her attorneys, Sen. Feinstein, and her member of Congress. So how did it leak to the press?
RELATED: Feinstein's false claims prove THIS is all about politics
This is actually a very big point, because whomever leaked that letter didn't give one crap for Dr. Ford's anonymity or well-being. They couldn't have cared less that her and her family would be stalked by the media — and worse — threatened by anonymous lunatics. She now has to have 24-hour security because of that leak. And this has been a huge talking point on the left, both outside the Judiciary Committee and during Thursday's hearing. Sen. Ted Cruz pointed the finger directly at the Democrats:
… she stated that she and her attorneys did not release the letter, which means the only people who could have released that letter were either the ranking member and her staff or the Democratic member of Congress because Dr. Ford told this committee those are the only people who had it.
Well that didn't go over very well with Feinstein. She quickly replied:

Yes it's that bad. And you know what Sen. Feinstein? This is all your fault. All of it!
Even if they didn't leak the letter, the way this entire thing has been handled has led to the circus that it ultimately became. We now know from Ford's testimony that she had brought this allegation forward before Judge Kavanaugh was even nominated. She brought this forward when the Trump Administration announced him as a possible candidate. So Democrats have sat on this… for months.
No one brought it up until literally the 11th hour. Why? So they could wait for more uncorroborated claims to come out. So they could ask for an FBI investigation that they know will never happen. Delay, delay, delay. That's all Dr. Ford is worth to them, and it's incredibly sad, not only to Dr. Ford, but to women throughout the entire country.
But Feinstein takes issue with being accused of this. Well you know what? If you don't like it senator, let's handle it the way you handled the entire Kavanaugh/Ford situation. The burden of proof is now on you… the accused. You are being accused of ruining a woman's life for your own political agenda. That means you are now guilty as charged until you can prove otherwise. It doesn't feel good does it?

Critics of Kavanaugh charge that the allegations against him are serious enough that his nomination must be postponed until a full investigation can be completed. Defenders of the nominee respond that the allegations aren't substantiated very well, and that a confirmation vote should be held quickly.
Political harassment at restaurants are a thing nowDemocratic Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.) was criticized roundly for advocating that members of the Trump administration be harassed by protesters in public spaces. She made the comments after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant because the servers objected to her politics.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/29/leftist-group-claims-jeff-flake-is-suing-sexual-assault-survivors-but-heres-the-truth","
        Leftist group claims Jeff Flake is suing sexual assault survivors. But here's the truth.
    Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R) twice rattled feathers Friday: Once when he announced he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, then again after he called for a week delay of Kavanaugh's confirmation to allow for an FBI investigation of allegations of sexual misconduct.
But Flake went viral for a third, separate reason: When a sexual assault survivor confronted him as he entered an elevator.
""You’re telling all women that they don’t matter. Look at me when I’m talking to you!” the woman shouted as news cameras captured the encounter. “You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter.""

Just hours later, UltraViolet, a women's activist group, claimed in a press release that Flake was ""potentially pressing charges"" against the women who confronted him, which the organization claimed are UltraViolet members.
""Charging sexual assault survivors for sharing their stories is shameful and cowardly. Senator Flake should be ashamed of himself for attempting to frighten survivors into silence. This is absolutely unbelievable,"" Shaunna Thomas, executive director of UltraViolet, said in a statement.
The accusation spread like wildfire. However, it turned out to be completely false.
What's the truth?Elizabeth Jones, a Flake spokeswoman, said the Arizona lawmaker never considered pressing charges against the protesters.
""Sen. Flake is not pressing charges, nor did he ever consider pressing charges,"" she said, according to USA Today.
Indeed, Flake aides communicated to reporters that UltraViolet's assertion was ""completely false.""

After Flake's staff and Capitol Police debunked UltraViolet's claim, the organization deleted its original tweet. However, in a correction, UltraViolet blamed the Capitol Police for their baseless accusation and characterized the truth as if Flake had once considered pursuing charges.

        TN-Sen: Dem Phil Bredesen says he won't support Chuck Schumer in fiery debate with Marsha Blackburn
    Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R) and former Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) clashed Tuesday night in their first of two televised debates in the crucial fight for Tennessee's U.S. Senate seat.
Aside from trading political barbs, the two debated tax cuts, Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination, the opioid crisis, immigration reform, and a host of other issues. The defining moment, however, may have come when Bredesen pledged not to support Senate Democratic leadership.
What were the highlights?Blackburn, whom President Donald Trump has endorsed, aggressively marketed herself as the best choice for Tennesseans while arguing that Bredesen is ""bought and paid for"" by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). The line of attack sought to minimize Bredesen's strategy of posturing himself as an independent Democrat not beholden to party politics.
And it appears to have succeeded.
After persistent attacks from his Republican challenger, Bredesen vowed he would not be ""political lackey to anyone"" if elected in November.
""We need to get new leadership,"" Bredesen said. ""I will tell you right now that if I’m elected, and when I’m elected and go to Washington, I am not going to be voting for Chuck Schumer.""
Clashing on Kavanaugh, Bredesen criticized Blackburn for quickly voicing her support for the judge in the wake of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct; he cautioned that ""we need to listen to everyone."" Meanwhile, Blackburn reiterated that she would vote for Kavanaugh if she were a senator.
Later, touting her endorsement from the National Rifle Association, Blackburn claimed Bredesen supports further restrictions on the Second Amendment. Bredesen, however, defended himself as ""a strong supporter of the Second Amendment"" who believes that ""reasonable restrictions"" bolster the right to bear arms.
Bredesen also attacked Blackburn for being ""very friendly with big pharmaceutical companies"" during her early years as a member of Congress. He claimed she supported bills that took power from the Drug Enforcement Administration, which he contended has contributed to the opioid crisis. Blackburn said her opponent's claims were false.
The candidates also sparred on the No. 1 issue affecting Tennesseans. Blackburn alleged it is the economy — to which she said tax reform has helped improve — while Bredesen said it is dysfunction in Washington, D.C.
What issue did the candidates agree on?Surprisingly, the candidates appeared to agree on immigration. Both candidates stressed the need for border security, while they equally voiced support for a path to citizenship for recipients of the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Blackburn said ""there should be a path for legalization for Dreamers,"" while Bredesen said the U.S. has a ""moral obligation"" to act in favor of ""Dreamers.""
""They are people that were brought here not of their own choosing. They’re, in many cases, virtually Americans in the sense that they speak the language, this is the home that they know, they have no more connection to Mexico or Guatemala or anywhere else than I do,"" Bredesen said.

        High school admin put on leave for these dress code comments that 'reinforce the rape culture
    A Tennessee high school athletic director was placed on administrative leave Wednesday for comments he made on an announcement video to students about the school's dress code, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.
Jared Hensley, who works for Soddy-Daisy High School, was talking to students about the school's policy banning athletic shorts. Here are the comments that got him in trouble:

It seems apparent that Hensley was making a joke, but that did nothing to calm the outrage from parents and other administrators about what he said.
The backlashOnce the video, which was initially posted on YouTube, got around, the school district's superintendent, Bryan Johnson, condemned Hensley in a statement:
Some parents were also highly upset by the video, and even drew connections between Hensley's language and the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
""The fact that they're coming from an educator is bad enough, but the fact that they're coming from a man in a position of power is even worse. These remarks are blatantly sexist and misogynistic,"" said Natalie Green, whose daughter attends a Hamilton County school. ""And do nothing but perpetuate victim-blaming and reinforce the rape culture that is so insidiously ingrained in our society.""
""This is how we Kavanaugh is getting so much support from the GOP. This nation has made sexism normal and acceptable. People feel like they can say things like this with no repercussions,"" said Alicia Whitley, a parent to four Hamilton County students.
Just a joke?At least one administrator took a step back to ask: Is it really worth getting this upset over a joke?
""There's a lot going on right now to be worried about this in Soddy-Daisy,"" said Rhonda Thurman, the school board representative for District 1. ""I'm having  a real hard time getting upset about this. I'm not worried about that right now. He meant absolutely no harm by this. This is so ridiculous. Can nobody take a joke anymore? He was just talking to the kids in their language and trying to be funny.""

        Democrat congressman berates Trump for 'piggish' insult to female reporter
    Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) berated President Donald Trump over what he described as a ""piggish"" reaction to a question from reporter Cecilia Vega Monday. 
""You never do.""
The contentious exchange occurred Monday in a media conference in the Rose Garden where the president was touting the agreement he had made with Canada to replace and amend the NAFTA trade agreement. 
""She's shocked that I picked her,"" laughed Trump after picking Vega to ask a question. ""She's like in a state of shock.""  
""I'm not,"" Vega responded, ""thank you Mr. President.""
""That's OK, I know you're not thinking,"" responded Trump, who apparently misheard her. ""You never do.""
""I'm sorry?"" asked Vega. 
""No, go ahead,"" responded Trump. ""Go ahead.""
Many critics of the president called the insult misogynistic, and noted some of the rhetorical attacks that he had made against other female reporters. 
Rep. Swalwell berated the president for the insult from his social media account. 
""Let’s never think it’s normal for a man to treat a woman — or ANYONE — the piggish way [President Trump] talked to the Bay Area’s own, [Cecilia Vega] today,"" said Swalwell. 

""It’s not normal,"" he added. ""And no tax cut or deregulation will ever make it so.""
Here's the video of Trump's insult to Cecilia Vega:

Vega referred obliquely to the exchange on her Twitter account later. 

""A news conference means you get to ask whatever question you want to ask,"" she tweeted.

        Attorney hired by MN Democrats concludes that abuse claims against Keith Ellison are unsubstantiated
    An attorney hired by Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party has concluded that the allegations against  Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) are unsubstantiated after his ex-girlfriend refused to provide video evidence to back up her claims. Ellison is currently running to be Minnesota attorney general.
What was Ellison accused of?Karen Monahan, Ellison's ex-girlfriend, has accused the congressman of physically and emotionally abusing her. In one incident, she alleges, Ellison dragged her off a bed while screaming obscenities. Monahan claims to have video evidence proving that this incident occurred.
Ellison, 55, has denied these allegations.
The video that Monahan claims to have is unrelated to a picture that has circulated on the internet, allegedly portraying Monahan after an attack by Ellison. However, Monahan has attested that the woman in the picture is not her.
On Monday, Karin Housley, the Republican running against incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) for the seat recently vacated by former-Sen. Al Franken, has called for an official investigation by Minnesota's current attorney general.
The accusations come at a time when many in the Democratic Party are arguing that similar accusations levied against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh need to be believed.
What happens now?While the state attorney general has not agreed to conduct an investigation, Democratic attorney Susan Ellingstad has concluded that the claims were unsubstantiated.
“An allegation standing alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred, particularly where the accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself asserts exists,” Ellingstad said in her conclusion. “She has thus repeatedly placed the existence of the video front and center to her allegations, but then has refused to disclose it.”
However, this is still only an investigation conducted by a lawyer attached to Ellison's political party, and not an official independent investigation. Ellingstad and Charlie Neun, the top attorney for the Minnesota Democratic Party, are partners at the same law firm.
Has Ellison responded?In a statement, Ellison thanked Ellingstad for “conducting this thorough, independent, and fair review.” He said that he believe “women who come forward must be heard"" and “have their allegations fully investigated.”

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/10/01/california-governor-signs-bill-requiring-women-on-corporate-boards-by-end-of-2019","
        California governor signs bill requiring women on corporate boards by end of 2019
    California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed into law a bill that will require publicly held corporations to include at least one woman on its board of directors. The law is the first of its kind in the U.S., according to the Los Angeles Times.
On Sunday, Brown signed SB 826, which forces publicly held companies to have at least one woman on its board by the end of next year. Boards with five members must have at least two women on the board and those with six or more members will be required to fill three seats with women by the end of July 2021.
""Given all the special privileges that corporations have enjoyed for so long, it's high time corporate boards include the people who constitute more than half the persons in America,"" Brown wrote in a letter attached to the bill.
Corporations found in violation of the law would face a fine of $100,000 for the first offense. Additional offenses would cost $300,000 per violation.
There are 377 California-based corporations on the Russell 3000 stock index of large firms that may be affected by the law, according to the report.
Who proposed the bill?State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D) and Senate leader Toni Atkins (D) proposed the bill in January citing women make up more than half of the state's population, but only 15 percent of the state's public corporations have a woman on their board.
“We are tired of being nice. We’re tired of being polite. We are going to require this because it’s going to benefit the economy. It’s going to benefit each of these companies,"" Jackson said in an earlier speech. “It’s time that we burst that man-cave and put women in the boardrooms.”
What do critics say?State Sen. Joel Anderson (R) voted against the bill because he believes it undermines women's abilities.
“I can’t support a bill that underestimates the power and strength of women,” Anderson told the Times. “To say that they can’t find their way onto a board without our help undermines all their hard work.”
Lucy Dunn, the president and CEO of the Orange County Business Council, said the bill was an insult to businesswomen.
“This legislation is, to me, insulting,” Dunn wrote in a statement to the newspaper. “Rather than celebrate the competitive advantage women bring to positions of leadership in a company, it relegates them to placeholder status.”
The California Chamber of Commerce also disagreed with the law, according to KQED-TV. The organization argued that corporations should be allowed to choose its board members without government interference. It said the law will make it more difficult to achieve diversity in other aspects, including race.
“It creates a challenge for a board on achieving broader diversity goals,” Jennifer Barrera, senior vice president for policy at the chamber, told KQED.
What else did Brown say?The governor noted in his signing message that there were numerous objections and serious legal concerns had been raised about the bill.
""I don't minimize the potential flaws that indeed may prove fatal to its implementation,"" Brown wrote. ""Nevertheless, recent events in Washington, D.C. — and beyond — make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message.""
The message appeared to be pointed at the sexual assault accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. A copy of the letter was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Anything else?Experts have questioned the legality of the mandate.
Jessica Levinson, a clinical professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told the Times there's a chance that the law could be challenged in court.
“I’m not at all convinced it would pass legal muster,” Levinson said. “It’s a clear gender preference in that you are saying you need to single out women and get them on boards. The question is can you make that preference and will it hurt men?”
Similar laws are already in place in some European countries.
Germany requires that women make up 30 percent of corporate boards of directors. France and Norway have mandated that 40 percent of board seats be filled by women.

        RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION: Sen. Lindsey Graham speaks for a lot of America
    Sen. Lindsey Graham spoke to millions of Americans Thursday. Millions of Americans who are exhausted after weeks of political insanity, who are tired of watching a man and his family publicly defaced, who are getting tired of the way the left is acting. It gets worse every day.
When we think, surely it can't get worse than this, the left plunges our country lower into the inhumane depths of a world without shame.
We are in a dangerous place. Humanity in the United States of America is at risk. How can we live alongside people who are capable of the degradation we have seen? Worst of all, we've had to just sit there and take it. Supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh has not been allowed.
RELATED: Search for the next Supreme Court justice keeps getting deeper into the gutterWell, Sen. Graham broke the silence for us. He spoke up. He said what so many of us have felt burning inside us but we're threatened by bullies for saying.
Here's what he had to say, if you haven't heard it. And if you've heard it already, it's worth hearing again:
 

 
Graham stood up for the dignity of America. The dignity the left has relentlessly and shamelessly attacked and degraded. Enough. Enough. If this keeps going, we're doomed. Enough is enough.
The left has been throwing a tantrum since the day Donald Trump was fairly and democratically elected president. Their toxic hatred is beginning to seem endless. It's starting to feel like they are trying to destroy life as we know it. To annihilate our country. It's hatred, pure and simple. Unhinged, psychotic. What's it going to take?
I want to speak directly to any Democrats or liberals or whatever you are, anyone who's sick of the way the left is acting. You're welcome to join us on the right side of history.

        Texas school administrator calls Michael Avenatti a 'lying piece of s***,' gets suspended
    A Texas private school administrator sent a vulgar message to high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti on Twitter late Sunday night that got a lot more attention than he ever could have imagined — and now he's been suspended from his job, according to KTVT-TV.
Butch Groves, Head of Upper School at the Oakridge School in Arlington, sent a private direct message to Avenatti, which the attorney decided to make extremely public.
""Meet @butchgroves, the Head of Upper School at The Oakridge School in Arlington, TX,"" Avenatti tweeted along with screenshots of Groves' message and profile. ""I have never met him before or communicated with him but here is his message to me earlier tonight. The parents of Oakridge must be so proud to have this man teaching their sons and daughters.""
What did the message say?Avenatti, best known as the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, has been in the news most recently for saying he has a client with damaging allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
It's unclear what aspect of Avenatti's reputation Grove took issue with when he sent the following message: ""You are a f***ing douchebag. You lying piece of s***.""
More than 16,000 people had retweeted Avenatti's tweet of the screenshots as of Monday night, and the message eventually caught the attention of Groves' employer.
What did the school say?The Oakridge School issued a statement Monday announcing the suspension and saying that Groves' message violated the school's policy regarding online communication.
“That said, The Oakridge School has clear policies in place regarding online and face-to-face communications,” the statement continued. “Oakridge employees are expected to maintain the respect, dignity and professionalism that is consistent with our mission. Mr. Groves’ conduct was unacceptable and inconsistent with these policies and standards. I have therefore suspended Mr. Groves indefinitely as we conclude our investigation.”(H/T The Hill)

        OH-Sen: GOP targets Democratic Sen. Brown with decades-old domestic abuse allegation
    At the same time that Democratic senators are calling for an investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from the 1980s, Ohio Republicans are bringing up an alleged assault incident from Sen. Sherrod Brown's (D-Ohio) past, according to The Columbus Dispatch.
Brown, the incumbent senator who is facing a challenge from Rep. Jim Renacci, was accused of domestic assault by his then-wife in 1986, according to court documents. She has gone on to support Brown in his previous two Senate elections.
“Sherrod Brown was confronted with his past domestic abuse last week, but Ohio media were quick to sweep it under the rug,"" said Jane Timken, head of the Ohio GOP. ""Sherrod Brown has never had to answer questions about his court-documented domestic abuse, and in the era of the MeToo movement, this is unacceptable.”
What's the story?Court records from Brown's 1986 divorce from Larke Recchie document her saying Brown had pushed, shoved and struck her on numerous occasions, and that she feared for her safety.
The allegations, which have surfaced during Brown's previous election campaigns, were brought up this time by a group called ""#MeTooOhio"" in a minute-long ad.
""I am definitely afraid of my husband, that he has struck and bullied me on several different occasions, he has completely destroyed my peace of mind and that I am extremely intimidated by him,"" Recchie said in the 1986 court records.
Brown has, for decades, denied committing any act of violence or intimidation against his ex-wife.
Renacci seized the opportunity to call out Brown for the decades-old allegation.
""Violence against women in any form is not acceptable and has no place in our society,"" Renacci said. ""Sherrod Brown's well documented history of domestic violence is deeply troubling. Ohioans deserve to know all the facts, and judge his fitness for public office for themselves.""
What did his ex-wife say?Recchie defended Brown against this most recent wave of attacks.
""This isn't the first time someone has gone after my family to score cheap political points,"" Recchie said in the Thursday statement. ""I'm dismayed that Congressman Renacci would do something this shameless, despite the fact that I've already addressed this matter. I was proud to support Sherrod in 2006 and 2012 — just as I am this time around.
""Anyone who suggests he is not an honorable man is just wrong. He's a great father to our daughters Emily and Liz and he's a wonderful grandfather to our grandchildren. Disparaging my family for political gain is disgusting, and Congressman Renacci should know better,"" Recchie concluded.

        NV-Gov: Trump stumps for Laxalt, other Republicans, at rally. Laxalt slams 'far left' as 'unhinged.
    President Donald Trump held a Thursday rally in Las Vegas for Nevada Republicans running in the upcoming midterm elections, including U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, 4th Congressional District candidate Cresent Hardy, and 3rd Congressional District candidate Danny Tarkanian, the Las Vegas Sun reported.
Trump also threw his support behind state attorney general and GOP gubernatorial nominee Adam Laxalt, calling him ""a very popular guy in these parts with a great family.""
During Laxalt's few minutes at the podium prior to Trump's raucous address, he told the crowd that “the far left has become unhinged."" With that he pointed to Nevada's ""neighbor to the west, California,"" noting that the Golden State possesses misplaced priorities, such as policing the use of ""plastic straws"" rather than paying attention to more pressing issues like its rampant homelessness.

Laxalt added that he doesn't want Nevada to become like California — and warned it might if voters elect his opponent, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Steve Sisolak, noting Trump's nickname for him, ""Shady Steve,"" and saying Sisolak is looking to raise property taxes.
""I will not raise taxes on hard-working Nevadans,"" Laxalt added to the crowd.
After holding a lead of less than 1 percent over Sisolak in late July, Laxalt found himself trailing his opponent by 2 points in a new poll released earlier this month.
What else did Trump say?Trump urged Republicans to vote, the Sun reported, saying the party that wins the presidency cannot get complacent when election time comes around. He also took another shot at the media, which he said peddles ""fake news.""
Upon mentioning his opponent in the 2016 presidential election, former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the crowd responded with its ""lock her up!"" chant.
Convention center security estimated the audience members numbered between 7,500 and 10,000, the paper said, with another 10,000 turned away over capacity limitations.
The anti-Trump contingentProgressive groups protested outside the venue, the Sun reported, as one anti-Trump member chanted, “We believe women, we believe women!” in reference to Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of a sexual assault last week in an incident that allegedly occurred over 35 years ago.
“I don’t think anybody can send a message to Donald Trump,” Battle Born Progress Executive Director Annette Magnus told the paper. “I don’t think he listens to anybody, especially when reason or logic are involved, but we do need to send a message to Nevadans tonight that Dean Heller and Adam Laxalt are no different than Donald Trump. Their rhetoric is exactly the same, their policies are exactly the same.”
Here's part of Trump's speech during which he talks about the wall he wants at the U.S.-Mexico border:

        Chelsea Clinton makes a bizarre claim about who is really Christian  - and who's not
    Chelsea Clinton angered many when she made a bizarre statement Thursday about who she considers to be acting in a Christian way, and who isn't. 
""As a deeply religious person...""
Clinton was addressing liberal fears that the impending confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh meant that Roe vs. Wade, the landmark abortion decision, could be overturned. She made the comments while appearing on a SiriusXM radio channel. 
“When I think about all of the statistics that are painful about what women are confronting today in our country and what even more women confronted pre-Roe and how many women died and how many more women were maimed because of unsafe abortion practices,"" Clinton said, ""we just can't go back to that.""
“That's unconscionable to me,"" she continued, ""and also, and I'm sure that this will unleash another wave of hate in my direction, but as a deeply religious person, it's also unchristian to me.""
Clinton continued on to say that the right to abort children was the only way women could participate fully in society. 
“I've been compared to slaveowners and Nazis in the last couple of months,” she continued. “Because I've had the temerity, as the Supreme Court did in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, to point out that our ability to participate fully in our society, including economically, hinges on our ability to be able to make choices for our bodies and our families.""
Clinton's bizarre claim flies in the face of the traditional understanding by most Christians that it is morally wrong to end an unborn child's life. 
Here's the video of Clinton's statement about abortion being Christian:

The economic argument for abortion?
Clinton also recently made the argument that it is economically beneficial to the U.S. to abort children. 
“It is not a disconnected fact,” Clinton said in reference to abortion, “that American women entering the labor force from 1970 to 2009 added three and a half trillion dollars to our economy.”
She later objected to how her comments were framed before reiterating her original point about the economic benefits of aborting children.

        Breaking: Kavanaugh accuser responds to Grassley ultimatum
    Dr. Christine Blasey Ford responded to an ultimatum from Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to answer whether she would testify against Brett Kavanaugh before a 10 PM deadline, or risk Republicans confirming the nominee to the Supreme Court. 
""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford""
The response decried the negotiations with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked for another day of deliberation before her decision. 
""I was stunned to see the Judiciary Committee noticed Judge Kavanaugh's vote for Monday morning,"" read the letter, ""in the midst of our ongoing discussions regarding the terms and conditions under which Dr. Christine Blasey Ford could testify before the Committee."" 
""The imposition of aggressive and artificial deadlines regarding the date and conditions of any hearing has created tremendous and unwarranted anxiety and stress on Dr. Ford."" 
The letter goes on to accuse Grassley and other Republicans of negotiating unfairly and dishonestly over the conditions of Ford's proposed testimony. 
""The 10:00 p.m. deadline is arbitrary,"" the letter continued. ""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-alterating implications for her and her family."" 
""She has already been forced out of her home and continues to be subjected to harassment, hate mail, and death threats,"" it concluded. ""Our modest request is that she be given an additional day to make her decision."" 
Former congressman and current Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz noted that Grassley retained the proper parliamentary procedures to have the vote on Monday, if they chose that option. 
""The Chairman, @ChuckGrassley , today officially noticed the vote for Judge Kavanaugh on Monday,"" he tweeted. ""Despite the delay tonight, this gives the Judiciary Committee the option to vote on Monday.""

Here's the Fox News report about Grassley's ultimatum:

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/26/nbc-reports-theres-a-fourth-allegation-against-kavanaugh-from-an-anonymous-accuser","
        NBC reports there's a fourth allegation against Kavanaugh - from an anonymous accuser
    NBC News says they have obtained a letter of a fourth allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, from an anonymous source that contacted the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
""They were all shocked"" 
According to the report, the accuser claims that Kavanaugh pressed her against a wall in an aggressive and sexual manner. She says that the assault allegedly happened after she had been socializing with him at a bar. 
""When they left the bar (under the influence of alcohol) they were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh,"" the letter read, ""shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually.""
The writer of the letter provided no names, and said the victim wished to remain anonymous. 
“There were at least four witnesses including my daughter,"" they wrote. 
The assault allegedly occurred in 1998. The anonymous complaint was sent to Senator Cory Gardner (R-Col.). 
These would be the fourth in a series of allegations against President Donald Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and said that although he had attended parties where he drank too much, he was never witness to any events of the kind described in the claims. 
""This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,"" Kavanaugh said of salacious claims made by an accuser represented by Michael Avenatti. 
In a long news conference Wednesday, the president defended his nominee, and said that his character was being unfairly smeared by Democrats and the media. However, he said that if the accusations were true that he would consider rescinding the nomination. 
Here's the latest of the Kavanaugh saga:

Republicans have scheduled a vote for confirmation on Friday morning.

"BLAZE","https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/09/28/judiciary-committee-set-to-vote-on-kavanaugh-jeff-flake-still-undecided","
        UPDATED: Flake to vote 'yes' — Judiciary committee set to approve Kavanaugh
    UPDATE: Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) revealed Friday morning that he would be voting in support of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in today's Judiciary Committee vote, CNN reported.
Original report below.
Eyes will be on Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) as the Senate Judiciary Committee votes Friday on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the committee for hours over Ford's sexual misconduct allegations against the nominee. Ford testified that the nominee had sexually assaulted her more than 36 years ago.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate opening statement and adamantly denied any wrongdoing during the lengthy hearing.
The committee is set to vote at 9:30 a.m. ET Friday.
What about Flake?Republican Sens. Flake, Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Susan Collins (R-Maine) reportedly met behind closed doors, along with moderate Democrat Joe Manchin (W. Va.) following Thursday's hearings.
After Kavanaugh testified, Flake, the only fence-sitting senator who serves on the Judiciary Committee, made a brief statement before huddling with the other senators, NPR reported.
""I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that, in the end, we are 21 very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent,"" Flake said. ""And in the end, there is likely going to be as much doubt as certainty going out of this room today.""
Republicans hold a slim majority, 51-49, which means Kavanaugh faces a tough vote when the nomination goes to the full Senate.
What about Manchin?Manchin, who is running for re-election in a state with strong Trump support, gave no definitive answers as to how he would vote, The Hill reported.
“Everyone’s trying to get some answers to a few things and we’ll go from there,” Manchin told reporters after his meeting with his Republican colleagues. “We’ve talked and we’re still talking. There’s no decisions made on anything, I can assure you of that.""
“There are some concerns that people have and they’re going to try to close the loop,” he continued. “We’re friends. We talk. There’s no decisions on anything. No one told me they made a decision and we’re all still looking and talking and comparing.""
However, The Atlantic's Elaina Plott reported that a source close to Manchin said that the senator ""will side with the overwhelming number of people in WV who want Kavanaugh confirmed.""
According to the source, ""Manchin likes Kavanaugh and has always wanted to find a way to support him,"" Plott reported.
Interesting: A source close to Senator Manchin tells me now, ""Short of claims that definitively prove Dr. Ford's allegations or a realization that Kavanaugh will gut the healthcare law, Manchin will side with the overwhelming number of people in WV who want Kavanaugh confirmed.""— Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018""Manchin likes Kavanaugh and has always wanted to find a way to support him.""— Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018What else?Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.) was among a few key GOP senators who were undecided before Thursday's hearings. After the hearing testimony from both parties, Corker issued a statement that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh.
""While both individuals provided compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation,"" Corker's statement said, according to The Hill. ""There is no question that Judge Kavanaugh is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and in a different political environment, he would be confirmed overwhelmingly.""

        Brett Kavanaugh makes a startling admission in interview over sex abuse accusations
    President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court defended himself from allegations of sexual harassment in an interview on Fox News Monday evening, and made a startling admission. 
""I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone""
Brett Kavanaugh said that not only did he not sexually assault anyone in High School or during his time in college, but that he had no sexual intercourse until well after graduating college. 
""We’re talking about an allegation of sexual assault,"" he told Martha MacCallum on her show. 
""I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone,"" Kavanaugh explained. ""I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter... The girls from the schools I went to, and I, were friends.""
""Through all these years that were in question, you were a virgin?"" MacCallum asked.
""That's correct,"" he answered. 
""Never had sexual intercourse with anyone in High School?"" she inquired. 
""That's correct,"" he repeated. 
""And, through what years in college, since we're probing your personal life here?"" MacCallum continued. 
""Many years, many years after,"" he responded. ""I'll leave it at that, many years after.""
Kavanaugh continued on to deny all the accusations against him of sexual harassment. 
""We're on the right path""
Kavanaugh's wife also spoke to MacCallum about the difficulties their family has faced throughout the contentious confirmation process. 
""The process is incredibly difficult,"" said Ashley Estes Kavanaugh. ""Harder than we imagined, and we imagined it might be hard."" 
""But at the end of the day our faith is strong and we know that we're on the right path,"" she concluded.  
Here's the interview with Kavanaugh from Fox News:

While Democrats would like to see Kavanaugh's nomination pulled because of the allegations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a defiant statement Monday that there would be a vote on his confirmation to the Supreme Court soon.

        MSNBC panel slaps down Feinstein's 'cheap last minute trick' against Kavanaugh
    An MSNBC panel didn't think there was much to allegations made from Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) that she had obtained a letter alleging sexual harassment by Brett Kavanaugh as Congress weighs his Supreme Court nomination. 
'Cheap last minute trick' 
Joe Scarborough excoriated the allegations from Democrats that he said were based on flimsy evidence but were meant to smear the character of President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court. 
""Mike, they get a letter,"" Scarborough said to Mike Barnicle, ""and say we're not gonna tell you what's in the letter. But Democratic staffers leaked to the press a slur. We don't know if it's true or not."" 
""But then they leak it at the last second,"" he explained. ""This is a guy, who has been, whose life has been examined by the FBI, and who has been screened a lot of times in his life."" 
""This looks like a cheap, last minute trick by Democrats,"" Scarborough added, ""whether you're for Kavanaugh or not, but this is why a lot of people just don't get involved in public service."" 
""Well that's it, first of all, let me ask you, are you surprised at this?"" Barnicle asked. 
""No, I'm not surprised by it at all,"" Scarborough responded, ""but for the Democrats who are doing this, they're only hurting their cause, and you just feel like OK, if you're going to make an accusation that is devastating to someone's character, if you're gonna smear somebody's character, then you know what, don't say I have a letter, I'm not gonna tell you what's in it, but I'm gonna send it to the FBI."" 
""That's bad form,"" he concluded. 
Barnicle agreed and panelist Willie Geist added that the FBI was not pursuing the matter, casting even more doubt on the claims from Democrats. 
Here's the video of the Morning Joe panel:

On Friday, the other classmate named in the letter told the Weekly Standard that he had never witnessed anything like what was alleged in the letter against Kavanaugh. 
Kavanaugh has completely denied the allegations. On Thursday, 65 women who had known him for decades signed a letter to vouch for his good character.

        Brett Kavanaugh defends his emotional testimony in WSJ op-ed - here's what he said
    After attacks from critics over his emotional testimony Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defended his actions in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal Thursday. 
""I am a pro-law judge""
Kavanaugh made the case that he is an impartial judge of the law and that he would not be biased if he were to be confirmed as a Supreme Court justice. 
""In each case, I have followed the law,"" he wrote. ""I do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge."" 
""I am a pro-law judge,"" he asserted.
Kavanaugh also addressed the allegations of sexual assault made against him. 
""After all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded,"" Kavanaugh wrote, ""I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations. My time in high school and college, more than 30 years ago, has been ridiculously distorted. My wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats.""
“I was very emotional last Thursday""
He defended the emotional testimony he gave that has been ridiculed by the left for its vehemence. 
""My statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled,"" he wrote. 
""I was very emotional last Thursday,"" Kavanaugh continued, ""more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters.""
""I revere the Constitution""
Many Democrats and pundits took the testimony as a sign that Kavanaugh didn't have the temperament to be an unemotional judge of the law in the highest court of the United States. Kavanaugh made the case that he would be unbiased in his decisions if he were confirmed. 
""I revere the Constitution,"" he concluded. ""I believe that an independent and impartial judiciary is essential to our constitutional republic. If confirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the Constitution of the United States and the American rule of law."" 
Here's more on the opinion piece from Kavanaugh:

Republicans plan to hold a confirmation vote on Saturday, but Democrats hope that a few holdouts might doom the nomination for Kavanaugh despite the majority that Republicans have.
